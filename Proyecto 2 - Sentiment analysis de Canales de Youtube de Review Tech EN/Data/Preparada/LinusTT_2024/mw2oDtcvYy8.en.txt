this is going to be fun there's so many exciting things happening in Tech today there's the Apple Vision Pro the release of the 480 super and we'll be mostly ignoring all of it to build a sick wooden PC two years ago we built our first wooden PC for winter Cotten that was pretty sweet but after that video came out we got a call from Matthew Chu of mxc builds who told us yeah I think I can make an even better wood PC and I've been told that he did you see for years Matthew has been designing and hand
building wooden computers that are absolutely gorgeous and he made this one specially for us what that means is I really really don't want to damage it no I'm not going to damage it it's on the table it's on the table Alex no no no no no look look look see look geometry it's fine what that means is we have the incredibly stressful task at least for Alex of doing this handbuilt PC case Justice in a live stream what isn't stressful though is telling you that this live stream is sponsored by
xplit if you need Cutting Edge yet simple to use broadcasting and streaming tools check out xplit you can even save 69% off your first purchase or subscription with code Linus if you go through the link below more about them later for now it's time to unbox our case and the most remarkable thing about it is not immediately apparent when you look at it but that it is handbuilt using normal woodworking tools in fact the video where it gets built is on his channel which uh I don't know the link
is not here but Alex is apparently ready and waiting with it oh my God yeah it's like hand buil hand built so this is like but then I was all who needs power for the rest of this process that is sick so the video is called wood delicious exclamation mark question mark I don't think the question mark is really necessary because it's clearly wood Licious the front panel was laser cut for us by a local shop but everything else was done with a circular saw a jigsa and files every case that
Matthew does takes one to three months to build he just kind of does this in his free time there are no orders for customers or anything like that but you can buy his plans on Etsy for 15 Australian dollars which for Americans is like nothing basically the front panel is birch plywood and the rest of it is solid Australian gum I do have one bit of feedback for Matthew um all of the rubber feet already came off oh it wasn't like that oh it wasn't like that did we ru took it out what's that well I
think you did right now no no no no no they were all on and then as I was turning the case they all came off so the adhesive is a little bit yeah you know what that that that's okay that's a minor issue we have replacement feed over in the other side we're going to go grab some before the end of the show and realistically there's no ventilation on the bottom anyway so you could just plunk it down if you wanted to but come come come on come come come on andtie come take a closer look at this okay
this is super cool are these magnetic yes oh they triy to be anyway there we  oo tempered glass side panels God uh yeah no no no I'm not going to break it I'm not going to break it that's actually a pretty cool Mount it's really on there oh my God this wood is amazing I've never seen Australian gum before I assumed that their gum would be horrible based on that they eat veite so why would I chew Australian gum but is a joke Australian spotted gum is is tree uh come come check this out 
graen 3D printed grills of course we put our asset tag sticker on it you know what um I'm going to break the rules and I'm going to remove our asset tag sticker because like I said before this build is all about doing Justice to this case we have a number of different approaches that we take when we do a build uh either we'll build it with a particular task in mind or we'll build it with a particular game in mind or in this case we're building it around a particular component and the first one is of course
the case and the second one is actually going to be the ram I know that's a very very unusual choice for a component to build around but these are pretty unusual memory sticks I am holding 16 gigs of a total of 32 gigs of vcolor X Sky we were first drawn to it because of its extremely shiny exterior hey thanks Alex he's got me um and the reason for that is that we think that it is going to look fantastic reflecting the beautiful spotted gum wood grain I'm actually on the wrong
side of the case here right now but Andy check this out how good is that going to look can you see the reflection no yeah you got to come come  o now on top of good looks these V colors are rated for a blistering 7200 megat transfers per second they're not the fastest RAM on the market uh G skill for example will sell you some Ram that "That's rated at 8,000 megat transfers" per second but we have never had any luck getting anywhere near those speeds this VC color meanwhile is Rog certified
which means that it should go all the way to 7400 megatrans per second in an Rog z790 motherboard which the Keen night among you will notice this is not so here's the thing we were going to go z790 for this build and then we went shopping and we realized that the z790 I was 640 Canadian dollars and I get it Canadian money worthless well not worthless that's almost $500 US so after throwing up in our mouths a little bit we decided that we would be perfectly happy with the b760 I
especially because God it's like on the higher end chip hip sets a big part of the benefit is especially on the AMD side that you get all these extra pcie lanes and it's like what am I going to plug into them there's one GPU slot and typically a Max of two m.2 slots on these ITX boards I've seen some with more but it's very unusual so Asus claims that this board should be good for up to 7600 megat transfer per second ram so as long as we've got a CPU that has a good integrated memory controller
we should be able to get the best possible performance out of our Ram we do lose overclocking support but frankly we've had very little luck overclocking when it comes to 14 10 here you want come get close up uh because Intel is clocking them so close to their absolute limits right out of the factory anyway oh man that's shiny what's shinier this or Trident Z rolls you know I'm actually very surprised Alex to see you go with super shiny Ram cuz as I recall you were not a
big fan of G skills tried Z Royals no I love those you remember how much I used them oh wait no yeah all the comp all the um sleepers never mind it wasn't you me no it was you and a bunch of other people The Royals are they're they're they're very polarizing I love them yeah yeah whereas some people feel like we should abolish them anyone anyone else get it oh  monarchy um anyway we also don't have an industrial Chiller so thermals are going to stop us uh from getting more performance out of this thing long
before the overclocking support of our motherboard is an issue uh I realized we haven't really like gotten any close-ups or anything kind of like we would in a normal build video but this is a live stream so what the hey it's more about you know talking to you fine folks anyway why don't I pull up my live chats here how you guys doing what is this video about asks a a boring title okay first of all I think we chose a perfectly good title so I think your username is an unfair
attack second we're building a computer in this sick case look how beautiful it is now uh quick thing I just wanted to shout out uh the social accounts for mxc builds so instagram.com mxc builds uh youtube.com/watch Mark V equals Capital B5 lowercase z capital Z lowercase k capital G lowercase w lowercase n and then all caps lie why I'm going to try not to read too much into that why is that how you decided to do that well it's just mxe Builds on YouTube well that's that's
what you wrote I just read whatever's on the Instagram I just read whatever's on the prompter go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself Vancouver wait oh no oh no you can't you can't bleep it it's a it's a it's a reference don't worry about it anyway anyway the last one uh is he's on etsy etsy.com mxc builds okay the okay we did we did warn the float plane chat that this stream was going to go a little off the rails I told you this would happen anyway as I already outlined one of our big goals for this build is
getting the most out of this memory and for that going ITX can actually be an advantage and I have a prop motherboard here ah an at motherboard to hold up and talk to you guys about why that is the trace length to the ram is actually physically shorter not the first slot okay so not slot A1 here but slot B1 doesn't have slot A2 in between it anymore see they are right next to each other this helps with signal Integrity quite a lot and the reason for that is that a distance and B if you were to use
uh here oh oh yeah okay um yeah no really mainly comes down to distance also when you load up all four memory slots on an ATX motherboard we actually for the most part yeah I don't think we've recommended loading up all four slots in a system in years at this point yeah they haven't done that sort of a configuration for quite a while where it makes sense and the reason for that is that if you use the first and third slots the signal will bounce off the end of the wires in the other slots
and it can cause interference which is why you will typically especially if you're running high-capacity dims you'll have trouble getting the same kind of speed if you're running all four sticks versus just two so we've got just one memory stick per Channel they are physically closer to the CPU and the traces are exactly as long as they need to be all right this is going pretty well so far I feel like we're going to be done this build in like 20 minutes at this rate great it
always feels like that though and then we get to the all-in-one liquid cooling no no not yet let's talk about the CPU next and get that installed we've gone with here we go a core i7 14700 K 20 cores eight of which are P or performance cores 12 of which are e or efficiency cores and is anyone else wondering you know how Intel is going to manage The Branding and messaging for the new what are they low power efficiency cores is that what they're calling the ones on meteor Lake i h no I
haven't heard about this okay so Alex hasn't got his meteor Lake briefing yet so I'm going to give him the explanation at the same time as I talked to you guys about it so on meteor Lake which is there is that also 14th gen branding no no no right cuz that's core Ultra that's the first gen core Ultra branding okay so on meteor Lake you've got performance cores or PE cores you've got efficiency cores or ecourse and those are on like the compute die like the the actual CPU die then they have
these new low power ecor that are on the S so die so those are really cool because you can light those up when you just when your system's running a Windows update or something and it can leave the whole compute tile powered down essentially I mean it's never completely powered down in that context but it can be basically powered down but what's challenging is uh my understanding is those don't perform as well as ecor so we had this really simple okay here I want to get the
closeup of the install we had this really simple system where you had CPU cores and then intel was like um actually no we're going to have some that are like performance cores and some that are efficiency cores but don't worry we're going to keep things really simple it's just p and E performance efficiency and then they were like hm couple Generations later three generations later we're going to mix it up we're going to have like e cores efficient efficient cores uh none
of this really matters from a gaming standpoint those eight performance cores are going to handle the vast majority of games pretty much on their own yes I know about City skylines too yes that will consume all the CPU compute that this thing could possibly muster but for basically everything else there's MasterCard sorry there's the the performance the performance course uh these will Turbo up to 5.6 GHz really 253 wats max power well it does more than that because of course it does yeah Intel
it's always funny to me you know what the quickest way to identify a fanboy is anytime they talk about how that particular brand is known for like too much heat or bad efficiency or good efficiency or or very little Heat because let me tell you every single one of the big three so here I'm talking about your Intel your AMD ATI and your Nvidia has had a period in their history where their efficiency and their thermals sucked and were terrible no Intel is not known for being efficient even before the current
generation Tom Foolery anyone else remember Pentium d no that was that was a mess man I remember uh because I was working at NC at that time and from time to time uh the guys would come out of the tech shop and they'd be like hey mine is check out this uh check out this board okay these were single core processors that would run so hot and overload the vrms on especially those those older generation motherboards so hard that the entire back of the board would be dis colored
in an area this big around the CPU socket it would be just Brown so you'd have like you know that blue that ack used to use back in the day for their pcbs you have these blue pcbs that were just Brown in an area this big around the back of the socket like they were a mess and don't kid yourself AMD has had their own periods of just atrocious power efficiency allo are I mean that was like almost a 10e period for AMD anyway um the screws for this appear to be quite um DIY orientated I don't
actually see motherboard mounting screws Alex am I supposed to have any or am I just going to forage for myself cuz I can do that well first you should worry about the aiio I should oh AIO goes in first before the CPU yes oh okay sure anyway we picked this chip cuz it's 400 bucks on new egg versus $575 for the I9 and we don't expect any appreciable difference in in gaming performance man that's something that I feel like even even smart media like even people who know better have kind of been drawn
into is using core i9s for gaming you do not need a core I9 for gaming it's utterly unnecessary um what you will need if you do go with a core I9 or realistically any high-end Intel chip these days is pretty substantial cooling so we've gone with the aorus liquid cooler 280 and the main reason that we went with this is because it was the one that would work in this case even then it was actually kind of a struggle the case was designed around the Arctic cooling liquid freezer
2 2080 mm so that's the same radiator size but a slightly different cooler uh we had to change that one out because Intel being Intel decided to ever so slightly change up their CPU mounting with LGA 17 00 it's their current socket for 12th 13th and 14th gen processors and we don't have that bracket for the freezer too so we also tried oh look at this Alex has props yeah we also tried the Kraken 280 um but wait we didn't we didn't like that one because oh the it just physically does not work oh so is
it just that the end tanks are ever so slightly oh like bigger or the thick oh it's thicker no the problem's here so it is thicker it's it's on the motherboard that's where we have the issues oh so if you look you try and put it this way it hits your RAM you turn it this way so the tubes don't H A Little Closer Andy okay I got I got it and then you have to have your outputs for your other stuff so that's coming out like uh yeah yeah you you get the problem it hits the ram it hits the RAM
and the ram is the center of this build because we've we thought it was shiny we thought it was shiny oh my God okay well anyway there you have it guys so we're going with this thing and I guess I get to Mountain a while I don't know maybe we do some merch messages Dan do we have the merch message dashboard turned on today yeah yeah I've got a couple here for you if you want Co no I don't I don't want you don't want I was just asking we'll do it later then no no we can do it now okay
yeah we can do it now if you insist by the way I love those headphones they're they're nice aren't they yeah they get a little uncomfortable after 5 hours but I mean 5 hours is a long time to wear any headphones true yeah you want great though Dan you look great only for you uh let's see when are you going to do more fir Tru unboxings you know is it time to talk about this Alex how dangerously close we got to buying a  sure on Craigslist I found like a 1950s era fire truck and this was a couple of years
back when we were looking for something to do as our April Fool's joke for that year and I thought to myself man how funny would it be if we bought and unboxed you know I mean obviously it's it wouldn't be in a box because it's a truck uh but if we bought and unboxed a literal actual fir Tru and uh that that got as far as asking Ivonne how the accounting would work for it um because we would obviously be like reselling it immediately so is there any way to um is there any way to buy it um PST I think
it's PST uh provincial sales tax exempt because we're buying it to resell but it turns out if you plan to use it before you resell it that that doesn't work so we're kind of look looking at the cost for it like is there any way to optimize the cost of this transaction so that it's not any more ridiculous than it already has to be and the answer was no and I think it was going to cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of around "$10,000 does that ring a bell I don't" remember 10 or 15 I don't think the
thing was even verified running at the time uh although I think they were saying the pump worked so if you wanted it for like you know a fun exhibit at like a kids you know Activity Center or something like that then it would have worked great for that but uh as an actual truck not so much um Alex yeah does this just kind of does this just kind of go in here oh instructions yeah instructions oh cool oh wow okay remove the eight screws oh what a wonderful excuse to talk about the fact that bit
prices are going up on the LT screwdriver in probably the next few months so if you want to pick up a set of hex bits or um any of the other different bit sets that we've got then go and check that out we've got all the different colors of screwdrivers available on there right now we've got noctua we've got the uh retro driver the totally non-infringing retro driver the classic black driver uh let's go ahead and see uh yes metric thank you my Commonwealth friend for using metric hat
on your case um Dan I forget what that question was did I answer it I think I think that counts as an answer yeah yeah yeah all right cool good stuff yeah all right let's follow some instructions want to hit me with another merch message yeah sure um hey Lads with the Raspberry Pi IPO announcement what other single board computers are you looking to for new excitement oh that's a good question um you know personally I think that we are very close to well not I think I hope that we
are very close to seeing um more risk five options in single board computers not necessarily because I think that there's going to be a significant performance advantage to risk 5 in that space But because a lot of people learn development on these on these lowcost computers and I'm rooting for risk five I mean I know I'm not supposed to be a fan of anything but you know risk risk five is not not a a company it's more of an idea um it's a way to make Computing more affordable more accessible more
open um I think it's really aligned with the mission of I mean I have no idea what didn't they previously go by raspy Foundation yeah like I have no idea what someone like Ras pie foundation's Mission ends up looking like when they've gone IPO because when you go IPO um it's about the money and anything  show really no applause no nothing yeah that's thanks down that's about all I deserved for that I got I got a um like it's not a golf clap because you didn't make any noise at all so I got like a
what what what do we what do we call what do we call this clap a Pity clap pity clap I don't I I wasn't really listening I don't really listen to you much it's like half listening I'm so sorry that's fair I mean he's busy he's  resume I don't like doing the cover letters it's too much effort I just have to work here forever really is a really is a lot of work although Dan's actually pretty good at writing which you guys uh which you guys might not know about him am I we should have a new I think so oh
okay good yeah I mean every time you've sent me anything it seemed good good yeah I mean I got a lot of practice with all the documentation yeah yeah man Dan's had to do some Dan's had to do some wild documentation stuff so can I just can I just say I actually really like this man how easy was that I feel like metal case manufacturers could learn a thing or two I mean I guess when you don't have riveting as an option you're not going to put rivets in your case but this is great you just take off one
panel with a hand of screws and then this mid plate is just held in with a simple sliding friction mount and by the way guys I don't know much about joinery so that's like the art of very very fine woodworking but this is the tolerances on this are so tight that I'm not even sure if I can get this back in um so I think that usually indicates good joinery right yes sure I think so I'm just a little bit scared when you so that you can't get it back in oh why was I not supposed to take it out no I was
supposed to take it oh I was supposed to slide it enough to allow the aiio to be installed I see and this my friends is why you read the text and don't just look at the pretty pictures that right there is a tech to um oh boy hold on a second well we we'll worry about that once the AIO is yeah we'll worry about that later oh no oh okay yeah all right well anywh who uh sure Slide the motherboard enough to allow the AO to be installed I still don't know where the AIO is supposed to
go insert the aiio in the orientation shown okay I think I can do that it looks like it goes like this oh there go all the screws oh you know I think I can do this hold on this is one of those uh can you be can you play the role of NPC for me so we just need a little exclamation Mar Mark above his head I have a for so yeah so I I come up and um uh what can I do for you good sir my screws they have dropped can you please pick them up eight yes um and what kind of exp reward
can I be expecting for this uh you can continue the live stream ah good okay uh okay uh uh uh okay harvested okay I got three uh we should have a total of was it six or eight  five no uh there's a couple on the table hold on yes I have succeeded and uh hey you can't succeed  suck what that's wisdom Dan see look what I learned from my mistake take the screws put them in a bag a nice high visibility bag Tech tip you got the best tips thank you uh right put the put the radiator in the
orientation shown um all right you'll have to forgive me for having no idea I think I think this is supposed to be the tubes and this says intake but what's really confusing is that the arrows are drawn like that which would indicate that this is the intake of the fans but that would make this an exhaust correct okay so then I do understand how  umm so which way was this in because I feel like that might matter uh okay this is at the top of the case where presumably the power button is and um
this is the bottom of the case where the feet used to be before I knocked them all off before we started oh no there is technically one there okay good all right I think we've got everything reorientated correctly nope this goes like this all right I'm sorry dude I uh you know when we're done you're going to be like wow lonus did an acceptable job of this build um so maybe just skip to the end don't subject yourself to this whole this whole ordeal now I get to figure out how this
3D printed mounting hardware Works um Alex doesn't have any further notes for me on this so I guess I'm just on my own  spacers okay uh I see what look like threaded inserts and I see what looks like nope no okay I see more spacers maybe these spacers were not available in full height and oh oh hello okay I think that might be it Alex ah yes nice I've got this I've got this I've got this other different size of hex head uh Dan do you want to hit me with another merch message yeah sure let's see what we've
got here hope we all are having a great Wednesday by the way Wednesday is it Wednesday it's a good oh is it not Wednesday I think it's Wednesday oh good thank okay I don't even know uh lonus you have been given a second chance to install the fire pole will you heed the call no the fire pole was never going to happen I was always very clear very clear with the team that there was never going to be a fire pole and there was no point in pursuing it  just when you get old and boring you
become what I like to call liability averse I don't like liability anymore and a fire pull that's a liability and I'm sorry I'm sorry if I'm not as cool as I used to be but I um I'll accept that knowing that I'm less like to be sued we do a man we do a lot of stuff these days it's just like no man play it safe play it safe play it safe all right Dan hit me hi lonus I know you have banned the use of sentences starting with so do you have any thoughts on Tech tubers using
actually in videos some use it a lot in a single unboxing video ah I actually don't have a problem with that and I can explain why they're doing it actually is a really useful filler word when you are not just trying to stall for time but you're also trying to add emphasis to what you're saying and I understand the objection to it it's actually very similar to my objection to so because actually doesn't actually change the meaning of the sentence no matter how many times you use it it actually makes
no difference if you go back to what I just said and remove the actes I said exactly the same thing I actually did so yeah I it's it's kind of like using like you know like I I just like can't and everyone has their own indoc secrecies when it comes to stalling for time you know some people um while they're thinking um oh you know what I'm going to call out our new CEO um has anyone else noted noticed how often he says at this point in time I have not but now I will he has always done that
and I don't think he'll ever stop doing it at this point in time doesn't change the meaning of what you're saying you could just say um I think that this is a bad Direction and then you could add at this point in time but you don't have to because you your sentence would have had the exact same meeting regardless of whether you did uh so I think it's one of those things that we just have to kind of we have to kind of tolerate from each other the reason I object so strongly to so is that it can get very
repetitive um and very noticeable particularly at the beginning of a new idea and what's really challenging about so is not so much that it's an issue for the audience but rather that it's an issue for our editors if every time you knew a do do a new take you knew a do take um if every time you do a new take you start it with so then what can happen is if our editors are trying to are trying to cut you know the last part of what you said in that previous take and then they're
trying to bolt on the next thing that you said you're going to end up with this abundance of sews that is really jarring and I've seen it happen uh both with myself and with our other hosts and I I just find it really distracting and it creates extra work for the rest of the team so so is less about that I I have any kind of personal objection to sew if you go back and watch our older videos I'm a big sewer practically a seamstress seamster Taylor I don't know it doesn't
matter the point is that I used so a lot and I relied on so a lot as a as a cheap easy transition from one thing I wanted to talk about to the next thing so with that in mind it's so easy to start a sentence with so um but all I've basically done then is encourage the team it's it's not actually banned it's just banned to lazily start every sentence with it because of the editors um so so I've challenged the team to use it less that doesn't mean we never use it it can be when used sparingly a useful tool to
start a paragraph or to start a sentence with so but I just go out of my way to make sure that I I'm only using it when I want to emphasize it so with all of that in my but so when you so you'll see me especially in the scripted content uh that tends to be how I like to use it now rather than overdoing it at every turn I I can't believe how long I spent talking about that and I also can't believe that I'm not really sure what to do right now uh this clearance is not quite right and if I used only the
shorter one that would be too short and if I um use this one it's actually quite a bit too tall Alex no did I not shove a love this in enough is that the issue or um this radiator just bent a bit M mm has both above I mean okay it's possible oh oh yeah I see what you mean no oh Al it goes in a lot more ah maybe we just have to use the other ones well there's your problem no no no no no no now it's good now it's good with the one shorter one so the extension seems to be if you have
a thicker style of radiator so now I get to undo everything I just are you really showing that thing off again yeah have they heard the click now they have don't hold your breath for that screwdriver we are working on it the all metal screwdriver is going to happen but it is not the kind of thing that's going to be affordable in fact we've even talked about potentially delaying it uh because we know that in the tech industry and gaming industry which is where a lot of our community Herald's from um it's a
pretty tough time right now and we felt like it might come across uh somewhat insensitive for us to release like a $250 like machined metal screwdriver so I don't know guys Vibe check uh do you you know do you guys would you be offended if we released a screwdriver that was not affordable uh by basically anyone or would you just be like well that's a thing that exists I don't need to buy one but hey good on you want the smaller screws now uh yes yeah yeah I I switched over okay cool uh okay let me
just let's just check the clearance here cuz you know what Alex that is still Way Too Tall huh yeah so maybe it's no but that one's too short I'm a little confused I think we just send it with these ones and call it a a uhhuh measure the offset of the radiat of the front panel using collect a set of spacers that match the offset distance okay so we did oh is it these guys you're supposed to have yes ah okay I saw these washers and I immediately went oh okay those are the
washers for when you install your fans okay let's do it right let's do it right these are for here we go making up very very small differences so we need oh good gravy yeah I think it's two of the really skinny ones and then oh seriously this guy never goes anywhere without calipers what a weird personality Quirk what ever since I put them in my backpack they get used absolutely all the time I mean look I'm not telling you you're wrong I actually desperately needed calipers the other day and I
realized I don't have a pair of calipers at home and I was really upset did you decide that two was the correct amount cuz it is isn't it called a pair of calipers cuz of this oh oh did I just two is the right amount yeah okay oh oh God okay fetch Quest time again I need one 1 mm washer are these one mil I think these are the one mil ones yeah okay we got this we got this Alex so we're going to use this one H Dan want hit with merch message stall for time uh at this at this point in time I need a
merch message um so actually like you know like so oh God I know it's not out yet uh but at this point in time how hard was it to get a good Palm twist feel on the Precision screwdriver while making it uh um store bits well that's subjective and in fact one of the two people hosting this video doesn't think we got a very good Palm twist feel um which is the one that you like better Alex I can't remember uh one of iFixit old ones is really good okay so in terms of things we
actually competing against that still exist is there anything that you think is better uh I don't know I I have the old one so I'm not too concerned fair enough you got yours and everyone else can just go off themselves no well but it's it's how you use it so we use our Precision driver slightly different do you want to grab the do you want to grab oh you're grabbing your okay okay fine we're going to compare I'll grab mine he'll grab his  watch what come what are you doing you this
look at this guy he's laughing like he  saying wow he try he tries he tries really hard but it's a bit of a struggle okay here we  okay so this is ours this is the old iix it one that Alex likes and what you'll noce is that while we do have a length and girth Advantage Alex has far more ribbing yes I really like the knurling when it comes all the way up to here because then you can hold it index finger there and like that great whereas I am more of a this goes kind of here in the palm and I'm a
down here kind of neural Twister so you showed me a different way that you used yours that was like like this or something and you would you would do that yeah sometimes put it like there yeah so it would be it would be hard to reach the nerling if you were to to do that so everyone has their own preference personally I'm really happy with this one and one of the things that makes me most happy about this one is that uh do we have um oh yeah I don't need I don't need the wrench it's not
that tight I haven't actually shown this yet we are going to have interchangeable tops so we are already planning a concave one if you really like putting your finger on the top we are already planning a convex one if you like it to be more rounded going into your palm um it will ship by default with the flat top and then oh sorry sorry Andy uh see the little laser LTT on there and then we are also already planning um a bigger one which will have two benefits if you have big hands it'll make it cup a
little bit nicer and two it'll make it  audience so with that hybrid ceramic bearing I'm not going to make you guys uh sit and watch while this spins until it's done but we'll we'll just let it kind of sit there while I use my fullsize driver to finish installing this where' that go there it is Dan do you want to hit me with another merch message yeah sure we got a few more in here um how have you seen traditional non- te roles I'm an attorney for an example transition into
Tech roles or lmg I worked it in college and minored in CS but I'm struggling to get into a tech company wow a was a big question that's a really big question um I got to be honest with you guys I mean common misconception we're not a tech company so much as we are a media company so we definitely do look for a very Tech adjacent skill set because otherwise it's it's pretty it's pretty tough I got it it's pretty tough to succeed here is that still going yes it's still going um and for our part we don't
really look for people that necessarily have exactly it stopped uh we don't necessarily look for people that have exactly the perfect background obviously having some experience is good but I mean that's a really great question I mean when I was very early in my career the answer was obvious right like I don't know you go you do volunteer work at a sort of adjacent uh place you know you uh you volunteer at a Veterinary Clinic if you're trying to make connections there or whatever else but
when you're established in your one career and you're transitioning from that to another career truthfully I'm not really sure how to do that I went straight from the one main career that I ever had to starting my own business so um was this was your first serious job right yeah like I had a bunch of Co-op terms and stuff before that in engineering you had a pretty um yeah so that's kind of what I was talking about before Co-op like Co-op volunteering like but Dan you you had a significant
career transition yeah that's right I mean it's it's reasonably similar um mine kind of moved into a far more Tech Centric thing I mean I used to be a professional audio engineer here but because we were kind of a mixed use space uh we also were a broadcast house and so we used to do live streams of concerts every weekend like um in 2019 pre pandemic I did around 192 4-Hour concert broadcasts um and so there was a lot of tech involved in that too I mean the audio these days is really Tech
heavy I guess um you know I kind of made a little mini float plane on the back of Amazon CDN for our like real- time transcoding and streaming and stuff like that you know we're doing big data science for all of our our marketing and um you know audience metrics and stuff like that I think basically it's going to depend on the company and their hiring practices in a big way like if they're looking for certifications or you know they're basically throwing away any resume that doesn't have X number of
years of experience then there's nothing you're really going to be able to do about that but if they're open-minded well then hey maybe if you can show you've got the skills you've got a shot um Alex yeah something that I observed yes is that this case unfortunately this this mounting mechanism does not allow the fans to sit right flush up against the radiator frame yes I am not a fan of that having this Gap here gives up a lot of the static pressure that this fan can generate and
instead of drawing air through the fins or pushing air through the fins you're going to be wasting a lot of it think of it kind of like uh when you're heating or cooling your home and you have a draft under the door um no that's actually not the same thing all I'm trying to illustrate is that having gaps when you're trying to do something with air is bad and it's not good for efficiency so I was kind of thinking uh if we have some foam tape or something we could probably get better performance
if we if we topped these up do we have any foam tape I actually had a reminder for myself last night to get some 8 in foam tape that I just have at my house for projects and I forgot but I can run to 105 right now sure and get the stuff that we have not as good but we can arts and craft it yeah let's let's arts and craft it I want to I want to show this in the in in its best possible like here I'll give you a closeup of what I was talking about there Andy and Dan do you
want to prep another merch message yeah sure let's see what we have here for those of you who aren't familiar maybe you don't watch the L show you only watch these streams or maybe you don't watch any of our streams uh merch messages are the way that we do paid interactions so rather than doing super Chats on YouTube or uh bits on Twitch or whatever else we do merch messages and the idea is that instead of just throwing money at your screen uh you can throw money at a nice t-shirt or
a hoodie or a screwdriver or some bits or a touque or any number of the other awesome things that we have over on LTT store we've got some great pajamas that we're promoting right now um and then it will if you're in the checkout I always forget if it's the card or the checkout if you're in the check no the cart if you're in the cart uh a little box will appear anytime we're live and you can leave a merch message it'll go to our producer Dan who will either direct it to the appropriate person to respond to
you uh respond to it himself or curate it for me and then during W show um Luke and then Dan we we will address them as a group sometimes to respond to you I'm trying to figure out why Alex brought four fans surely we can't fit that many fans in this system but anyway that's how merch messages work and then at least that way you know if you have to throw money at a screen you can throw money at a screen and then get an order in the mail some nice high quality merchandise okay Dan hit me sure hello I
was wondering if any more screwdriver colorways are in the works I personally would love a black main body with dark  accents okay in the long long term the ideal like the the the optimal outcome would be that we would have a configurator kind of like what Microsoft has with Xbox controllers that is super cool and um aspirationally that's what I would like us to be able to get to however there's a lot of there's a lot of business reasons why that's really difficult um it's
difficult to manage inventory because all of a sudden you take what is right now let me think how many how many SKS do we have so a skew or a stock keeping unit is um is is an an item right so right now we have our SKS for the add-on bits those are separate so for the actual screwdriver itself we have our skew for the bit pack that goes into the end we have our skew for the black black and orange in full size the stubby the in Black the stubby in black and orange we have the Retro we have the noctua in
the two various colorways and that's it now I can break things down even more from like an engineering standpoint we do have more SKS we have all four pieces of the noctua in both colors because we have uh we have two versions of it we have cream and brown and brown and cream so this is is four SKS for the Plastics and then for retro we have another four skews we don't offer this one inverted so that's a total of eight for black on black and black and orange we have a total of six so that's 14 we have 14
items to handle when it comes pun intended I guess uh to handle when it comes to keeping track of our plastic stock when we offer a configurator that increases by an order of magnitude essentially so it's a lot for us to keep track in terms of replenishment and in terms of stocking um it's a lot for us to figure out in terms of the workflow for how to essentially either build them to order or build small batches out of the out of the bare parts and then and then stock them um and I think that you
know right now during this refocusing time we really are quite refocused on video um so I don't think that's something you're going to see from us immediately but yeah in the longer term we'd love to be able to offer any number of different uh different colorways because I I think they look super cool and the feedback that we got from people at LTX was really positive like man I love this thing um even making that happen though they ended up costing I think about was it like 20 bucks extra
or something like that just to justify all the small run uh plastic production runs we had to do plus all the work we had to acquire those Arbor presses so people could build them themselves it was a it was a huge enormous undertaking to make that happen so I think if I came to the engineering team and I was like hey guess what we're doing it again but on a larger scale theyd probably hit me yeah so our foam tape selection not great it's way too thick in every direction oh that's terrible so my
thought this just tape over the sides brilliant yeah okay yeah let's do that okay all right uh Dan you want to hit me with another merch message yeah sure got some more here for you um these are M3 hey lonus you know how we create usernames or handles when we were children and they kind of stick with us for life if you could go back in time and change your channel name from LT would you change it well what I certainly wouldn't do is change it to any of my childhood handles um I
actually am pretty sad that I don't still have my original Hotmail account I I allowed it to lapse at some point because I had come up with what I thought was a pretty clever play on words for a new one and I had transitioned everything over there and I was like yeah who would ever who would ever want an old email account for Nostalgia uh it turns out me because I'm sort of a digital packrat but my first email address was Mumu theore cow at hotmail.com I don't know why I thought
that was funny I don't know why I thought that was cool I think it might have just been out of kind of frustration that it felt like even back then all the good handles were taken I mean I'm sure you guys feel even more strongly that all the good handles are taken these days but um yeah I I was I was from during my formative years on the internet I was MooMoo the cow uh uh I ended up subbing that out for uh the peanuts gallery which I thought was very funny because uh from Shakespearean
times the peanut gallery would have been like the the the the the Rowdy Bunch that are the UNC you know Standing Room Folks at the theater who might be you know cat calling and leaving their peanut shells all over the place and um  in a usually relatively Wholesome Way I was like kind of a troublemaker like I I liked trouble but I was like too much of a good kid to really get in that much trouble um so I would like I would play with I would play with fireworks and gasoline but you know I I wouldn't I
wouldn't take up the smoke um I don't know I don't know how to I don't know how to describe my my particular brand of being kind of a um kind kind of trouble um so then the peanuts gallery because it's the peanuts gallery is sort of a a reference to my name being lonus who is a character in the comic strip peanuts who most people these days if they know of it at all know it as Charlie Brown um so so lonus was Charlie B Charlie Brown's friend um and the love interest of Charlie Brown's
sister uh he was usually the voice of reason which um I thought contrast Ed really well with you know my name being the peanut gallery um I just I thought it was funny so that's that's the humor of 15 or 16y old me or you know whatever um that one I still have but I don't monitor it so don't bother so no I don't think that I would go back and and do either of those things and oh right so my my gamer handle once I finally adopted a gamer handle was closet gamer I still go by that unless I just call
myself Linus Tech in public uh because I kind of think it's funny that most people just think I'm an imposter because most people who put Linus Tech tips and their names are imposters so I actually get to be kind of stealthier in a sense by going as Linus Tech tips or Linus Tech uh rather than closet gamer no one will even believe me anyway if I say that that's who I am uh hey I thought these were supposed to be exhaust oh balls cool did you just was was that the last screw that you just
put in yeah nice and they're hard screws to find cuz I don't know we just have a bunch of different ride screws nice uh can I see one of them just so that I can uh go look you know what in fact can each of us just take two of them and can we just use the four that you have uh sure nice sharing is caring um so no I think lonus Tech tips was  names in summary I didn't pick it by the way so it wasn't even up to me uh you know these are not the right threading and we just have to kind of go
give her right uh it felt like the right threading to me cool well whether it is or isn't uh it's going in now sure yeah that definitely hoed out for me the first time H yeah yeah okay now it's threaded like this okay cool I mean any hole is threaded for any Screw As long as you push hard enough Dan sorry I got yeah you're you're right um y'all's work has helped change my life for the better I can't be more thankful lonus at all is providing Tech tips to use uh is providing Tech tips to us a
heavy burden to bear given how techy the world is getting every day no I um I mean I do think that we I think we do put a lot of pressure on ourselves sometimes uh I think that I you know why not I think yeah I think we have to put all four in to hold the spacers in Oh what now oh well I just you're correct I don't like the way they're threading in oh yeah no you have to give her I this one went in eventually just yeah and it's yeah it's in there um no in summary no uh I think there's
there's times when we felt pressure felt like um there's a an opportunity or a responsibility to do better I think that's where a big part of the motivation I think that's where a big part of the motivation for building the lab comes from um as you guys obviously can tell not everything's gone perfectly but we're patient we have time uh we're going to keep building keep making it better keep improving uh there's there's particular spaces where I think that you know when I was coming
up as a young Tech Enthusiast there was lots of learning resources that were super accessible and free and in some ways it's better now than ever what's that really cool Channel called that does those amazingly visualized uh deep gubes on like how Ram works and stuff do you remember what that Channel's called uh okay whatever they they need a they need a shout out so I'm just gonna I'm just going to go find I can find that for if you want to right now no no no okay um it was sponsored by crucial or Micron
or something like that so it should be easy to find yeah brand education so like there's there's some really cool resources now that didn't exist then but there's also resources we had then that don't exist or at least are not as plentiful anymore like it used to be that you could go to half a dozen a dozen different sources and get a reputable review of something like uh and I don't even just mean like gpus and and CPUs like the the big ones that get clicks I'm talking like a Tech aof flow
you know some some cooler you could go and find a dozen reviews of that and for the most part they would be like you know kind of done by people who really care about this and are making this their livelihood and that has just kind of shriveled and died um so yeah we do feel a responsibility sometimes to kind of bring that back but on the other hand so sort of more in line with the question that you asked is because of the world becoming more Tech Reliant do we feel that responsibility I don't
think so like I don't think we're I don't think we're really talking to your uncle and auntie um we don't make videos about how to clear the recycle bin you know like I I I don't think that's our that's our place and so talking to the enthusiasts you know Enthusiast to Enthusiast you guys have always been there you're always going to be there and as these things go more mainstream and people need help with the basics like you know oh why is it that when I press the button
it does one thing and when I hold the button it does another thing like that's not that's not really going to be our role um and I think we'd rather just kind of leave that to someone else oh that's going horribly um wow oh wow that really did I think your problem might have been that you were hitting it there yes I know and I moved it and then it oo yeah yeah it got hold on if we loosen this and then shovel of it a little bit that might help our idea of doing just two screws has kind of backfired
yes agreed okay there yeah you've got a  now got that so I'm actually at this point in time uh merch message that's how I sto for time it's a a good deflection uh let's see Highline us regardless of their skill level who would you most like to face in badminton 1 V one who would I well I know that Marquez owes me a match I I don't remember why we agreed on it but next time I'm in New York I actually missed him last time because I was in and out pretty quickly so I didn't message him tell him I was
going to be there uh but next time I'm in New York and I have some time we're supposed to play and I think it was supposed to be a channel super fun video or something like that channel super fun is on Hiatus but I see no reason why we couldn't upload uh lus Tech tips versus MKBHD badminton fight fight go how you doing there not good so is there a reason we're not using the radiator screws that came with that kit are they just not long enough they're just a random mish mash which is exactly
what we're dealing with in other stuff oh but are they a random mishmash that's at least threaded correctly uh I have been using them oh for a bit I see uh we have another problem not all of them are threaded correctly this spacer moved yeah I saw that okay um you know what I think I can get it I just need to okay nope not with that do you have a f life exit kit handy this is the uh kind of thing that we normally just remove from the video yeah yeah it really is that's okay I'm having
fun it's Wednesday guys it's hump day we're over the hump well at the midpoint we're in the hump yeah we're we're   uh okay so I was kind of thinking um uh if it's like just hitting it that's fine well here can we can we sorry Andy if we loosen this a little bit it might spin a bit more easily and then um no it's not hitting it it's just like not touching at all anymore so then I'll bring this let me see if I can bring this back oh yeah bringing it back oh oh yeah okay
man we're bringing that back no problem okay hey cool that should go in all right I'm actually going to put this one in first but are you actually going to do it no I'm going to try and put it in and then discover it's the wrong thread I believe that is a valid use of the word actually when you have failed to do something previously I think that is if someone objects to saying I'm actually going to do it this time they're they're being too much of a stickler okay Dan hit me oh sorry it was
the wrong thread but it's the right thread now okay is this installed I think that's enough oh no we've got we we've got some missing screws oh okay and we've still got to tape it I really sincerely hope that we put these fan leads on the right side for cable management because I did not consider that I also did not cool sweet but this looks awesome oh yeah check  guys sick love it can I make your day worse uh I mean I don't think that's a question you definitely can why aren't
we using the brown knock to a fans oh uh because we don't have 140s ah that makes a lot of sense oh we got the brown uh rubber covers some people have been asking about that uh yeah those are at the lab yeah I'm glad I'm glad it's in a different building now yeah it turns out that 40 mm anything is just really not common these days yeah we haven't had those in stock for a long while yeah uh okay maybe we should uh maybe we should get some 140 mm OAS oh you can get a closeup of that um yes I am aware that
it is inconvenient to have things in the other building I'm just I'm just ribbing if we can come up with a better solution we will we have bicycles that's a good solution yeah Z bicycles aren't a good solution we need a f we got I could just get some paint from 105 oh my God you guys see what I have to deal with all day right no wonder I no longer  CEO it sounds like a glamorous position but it's like it turns out you're CEO of the circus oh  master I mean Matt Pat and Tom Scott
didn't even have to deal with Dan and they're just like peeps yeah you're way  yeah oh man oh watch out should we move that box so Andy  it okay that's not bad actually yeah and this way we're not going to be leaking any air and we still end up with what is actually a pretty clean looking install love it okay here do you want me to turn this around for you uh I'm just going to fully block the camera oh God uh yeah okay I mean why do the people need to see anything anyway right okay Dan hit me
then sure okay give me one second here there we go I swear this is sort of about building a computer there will be a computer at the end there'll be a computer yeah there will be there'll be a computer at the end it'll be there's an end yeah hey Dan hey lonus for a desktop if you had to pick between a plastic case a metal case or a wooden case which would  pick for me uh it's there's no question metal I I love I love well crafted aluminum cases that's always been a bit of a fetish of mine um Silverstone in
particular those guys can do things with aluminum that just blow the Mind lean Lee is right up there as well I I love what those guys do uh even um face johnb johnb is a company that just came out of absolutely nowhere for me like what was it like five six years ago seven years ago we like saw them at computex or something we're like who the f is jnb and why do their cases look so good yeah jnb is pretty cool trying to think who else inwin inwin is one of those companies that for a long time
like back in the early 2000s their reputation was just sort of trashed here like I'm talking $26 cases like that sort of thing and then nowadays um they have it's like they have like a Skunk Works Department or something that every once in a while will be like oh by the way um you know unlike most other people we're an actual manufacturer you know that owns uh manufacturing facilities and uh you know we can uh make things that no one else can make like they just they'll build like a case that seems to exist
for no reason other than to act as a complete Flex like there's no way they could sell that many of them there's no way the costing makes any sense for most PC Builders back when we did that compensator that used that cast aluminum case with like the the swirl thing that was inwin um so yeah I metal I'm a metal guy practicality be damned this is going to be my daily driver screwdriver once we create it if anything Alex I was going to tell the guys I'd love to get a couple of copper ones and then like gold
plate them myself and assemble it myself so I could have like a gold accented one to go with uh my gold controller project by the way if anyone wants to buy the controller uh the previous buyer that we had lined up for it has officially ghosted now so um please buy it it would be great you know gold has actually gone up a fair bit just melted down so yeah so if you don't act now I'll destroy it I won't I can't I can't do it Alex to much went into it from you from the the
I forget their names but the the gold smithing place like it's it's a piece of art it's gamer art it's G oh cool is this ready to go in yeah yeah assuming I can actually get it back in um I hope so so damn almost did it again let's see if we can figure out how to do this uh so we did the fan leads on the wrong side so oh wait no it's it's probably fine yeah I think it's fine yeah so do I just need to again do I just need to how is this supposed to go in Alex it's not even
close oh wow you see what I'm talking  refund that you have to experience this for yourself Alex I'm going to undo it but not the whole way is it right smooth hold on hold on hold on no no no no no you don't no no don't don't look don't don't look don't touch don't touch okay okay okay okay okay okay go go go go go  it well don't do it like that that o yeah that's satisfying that's proper satisfying wow okay check this out you  look look at that look at this like I could I could lick this and
there would be no room for any saliva residue in between these pieces this is incredible I I love it I love this kind of thing man this is this is awesome uh Dan hit me sure let's see we got a couple more here yeah chat's like wow that's clean flush AF yeah yeah a little bit I love the vibe of the stream also does Alex know that he can screw open the iFix it screwdriver to store Two Bits M screws open right above the nerling what I agree with Alex on the nerling as well
where's your screwdriver I can unscrew it but I always thought that was just a flaw because of manufacturing what I know their plastic one has bit storage in it like with the little clips and everything like our full-sized one but I didn't know any of the metal ones had that yeah you can if you like Reef on it oh uh do you need a wrench does it does it have a wren are you sure you're supposed to do this point I'm definitely done it before we believe you I swear this never
happens can I try sure if get it I'm just going to say you loosened it for me  it yeah it's more of a friction problem than anything else well what you probably did um knowing you is you probably secured it at some point yeah I'm pretty sure that it came off and then I just put it in a vice and was like that's not happening again so good job I guess uh I don't think you're yeah I don't want to hurt it yeah yeah anyway thank you for the tech tip all right let's plug in our front
panel connector here power uh power switch uh Dan heit me okay uh do I even have any more curated oh lonus if this PC you're building right now had a name what would it be oh Alex is the Alex is the king when it comes to naming computers so you know what why don't we why don't we each come up with a name and then we'll let the Audi vote you guys can decide what you want it to be named I'll prep a poll are we going first of all are we going to go with I mean it's going to have to be a feminine name probably
right you typically go that route I was actually kind of thinking like something a b is it because of the wood I I have a name I have I've got one I've got one okay uh here so we we we'll come over here okay so Dan do you want to go ahead and create the poll and we'll we'll present our names with you know in a completely impart impartial way so that we won't bias the pool uh who wants to go first do you want to go first uh sure I think this should be Joe Joe yes Joe just simple Joe I wanted
Sandy Sand's not bad can I can I throw in a third I guess can we add Geraldine to the poll how the hell do you spell that Gerald g e r l d that one fits the way that I've done to sleepers more so Geraldine yeah okay all right well I just three nobody else has suggestion um I mean it's an odd suggestion but Colin wants JN which I think is just too similar to Joe and is going to kind of split the vote but I I'm not going to argue with them I mean  anyway all right so we'll let the people
decide actually are my poll is the poll result going to be up here oh yeah here we go here we go show the results in real time and Geraldine is running away with it not surprising yeah that's not surprising but Sandy Sandy is a very distant second oh gap's  Sandy boo what do you mean boo that's good that's good humor that's wholesome clean clean fun we have a computer to build Lin seed oil right right right right right remember when I said at the beginning of this stream that we would
focus on building the computer this time and it would be fast I I need a cable tie that's what I'm distracted by right now I want a cable tie to hold this do we have any cable ties kicking around I'll I'll get this AO mounted in  meantime does lonus know there's something called sandal wood yes I am aware of sandal wood and that would have been very funny if this was made out of Sandalwood but but no but no it in fact is not uh okay what's oh oh thermal compound that's good okay we're
apparently going with mx4 and we chose this because it was in that drawer okay do you want to get the   parit first okay uh Dan hit me sure yeah I'm still got a couple here to go uh would you ever consider making a tea handle version of the screwdriver I have a ratcheting tea handle and it's my favorite to use on anything that needs Force no one seems to make one for human hands what oh yeah we've had a couple of people request that actually it's not something that I personally use a lot um
but it is something that we would love to do the reason that it's a bit challenging is we would have to do entirely new molds for that and it would be a very substantial redesign on top of the cost and a tandle screwdriver is a bit more of a niche tool so we were concerned about amortizing the cost of those molds over a smaller number of units and um we were worried that it would result in a retail price that was too high to be palatable you guys got to remember that even though we've sold
like somewhere between "125 and 150,000 screwdrivers or" something like that in the grand scheme of things that is nothing that's a rounding error for a company like a you know a Stanley or a Milwaukee or like a like a Snap-On or someone like that so we're we're still an extremely small fish in a gigantic Pond uh can I help you you look concerned I'm thinking about how we're going to get the 8 Pin EPS connected uh creatively yes I mean it can't go under the motherboard anyway so well but
I'm thinking that it kind of can oh really yeah it would just be really annoying if need to do it right now dude that would be terrible there's I think there's too many rearm mounted components on this board I don't think it's going to have enough clearance even if we flattened it out completely well speaking of a power supplies do you want to have an argument yes yes we can but before we do that I want to thank our sponsor xplit whether you're a streamer a content creator or you're always on video call
for work xplit Suite of tools can help your content look more professional their broadcaster tool allows users to capture produce and stream highquality video to popular platforms like YouTube and twitch is Twitch still popular anyway um it also has some super cool features like custom trends transitions multi streaming per stream audio and it can record your broadcast as it happens with features like multiple audio tracks which makes post- production editing a breeze so check it out at the link below
and you can save 69% using Code lus now Alex wanted to use this power supply for the build it's a good choice 850 Watts 80 plus gold efficiency modular interface pretty reputable brand I see what you've done I wanted to use an sfx L power supply and the reason for that is that while it isn't technically a standard sfx sized power supply sfx L is silverstone's little pet project that uses a slightly longer version of sfx that allows them to use a 100 mm fan which is substantially quieter when it
spins up compared to the I believe it's 92 mil in a yeah yeah 92 mm fan that can that is as big as you can get on a standard depth sfx however Alex being the snarky git that he is brought dead ones no I brought the most alive ones we have so I said that these have problems with reliability we have three in the office one of them well we have two in the office we had three one was sent back because it died the other two were in the pile of power supplies that we need to test because they might be dead
all right so this one right here definitely dead almost definitely it says no power clicky clack from plof this one right here we might be able to use if you feel like risking it today it just says needs to be tested I don't feel like risking anything for any biscuits today all right all right there we go easy okay well I'm sorry to hear that hopefully it's not a widespread issue but if it is then Silverstone can you um deal with that then appreciate you guys all right let's
get a power supply installed okay with that in mind then hey are oh yeah we don't have any of those uh cable mod cables for Cooler Master do we no all right well with that in mind at least we have super flat cables so if we did want to do that thing you said and run this under the under the motherboard it is a possibility uh it's not that much work I only put three screws in the board ah so so yeah if we teamwork this I think we can do it pretty quickly while Dan reads us messaged doesn't have to be a merch
message by the way Dan if you just see anything interesting in the chat uh in the float plane chat feel free to kind of jot it down on a notepad or whatever uh Mo squid says oh no okay I got another merch message for you hi lonus what are your thoughts on the internet never forgets I feel like the internet is forgetting a lot of stuff that I swear existed no I I actually I strongly disagree with that these days in a way the the explosion in user generated content and in just general data storage
requirements for big cloud providers has led to an Internet that in my opinion is more forgetful than ever like when the last time you went on way back machine for example and fired up a site that you haven't visited did in a long time and we're  this uh I don't oh I can't think of that okay well then then that's even more forgotten because Alex apparently just doesn't even go on way back machine every time I go on there I'm like holy crap did Apple's site really look like
that did they really have that Banner like and part of it is companies making active efforts to make things forgotten like do you guys remember when um sorry I've just I've got apple on the mind right now uh but do you guys remember when um Apple forced that guy who was archiving all of their old marketing materials and their old Keynotes and stuff uh forced them to get rid of it like they want us to forget I mean with apple I suspect there's an ulterior motive that they want to sell us a table
book or like a a table Blu-ray at some point that has their old like Keynotes on it or something but um but that is absolutely a thing that's happening is companies treating what should be in my opinion uh part of the public record as their own copyrighted property and either hoarding it for themselves or asking for it to be deleted and there's so much now that it's almost like you can't have enough people who are passionate enough about preservation to preserve everything the sheer volume
of content is just impossible to deal with so no I I disagree that the internet never forgets I think the internet forgets far more now than it  started like forums man forums are disappearing and forums were a big part of what never forgot because they were low cost to maintain they were mostly text based uh no one ever deleted anything like moderators would or administrators could would lock threads but they typically wouldn't delete them and a lot of conversation went on in
public on forums and now okay you've got Reddit but I don't know Reddit feels a little more volatile than forums in terms of and I don't mean volatile in terms of people like arguing forums were as bad as Reddit because they're populated by people and people are volatile I mean volatile in terms of like uh like dram versus nand Flash you know volatile storage versus um nonvolatile yeah yeah yeah yeah optain forums were optain and reddits more like Ram you know as long as the power stays 
anything this is a really small computer for two people to work on it so I guess I just oh you know what I could do is I could talk about our GPU why don't I do that sure Nvidia launched the RTX 480 super today we have a review coming it is currently in editing in fact hey Andy how long's that lead do you want to come see who's editing it and uh check in on them nice hey Colin's on it or Dan's on it well someone's on it is this acoustic panel fixed here what's up oh oh is there someone on probation that I
shouldn't be showing oh no my concern is more so just tell them not to have like emails and stuff open oh yeah hey guys  minute oh okay all right yeah we'll just bring the camera in here uh I was just wondering who's working on the 480 video oh we have to go oh but you can probably see his screen oh is he work from home yeah oh all right well um okay I guess this is going to get even more adventurous we're just bringing the internet into your space um this is good   sh okay so um here's the video being
edited remotely L roll performance per dollar graph um so yeah it's currently in editing and then it's going to go to uh QC and then it should be up I think either very late today or early tomorrow I'm not sure anyway Andy if you want to go back that way with Alex I'm just going to drop off uh Ed stuff just I like to be helpful you know that's that's my business cards Chief Vision officer and janitor I'll meet you on the other side you want to turn around Andy might be good idea Andy or not I'm here I'm
back okay so we're not really designed for this kind of thing but it worked huh neat good good job everyone we got used to you now we for it this is a really long SDI cable is this one of the ones that you built Dan no oh all right uh no we never ended up getting the the stuff to do the custom crimped ones Oh I thought we were going to do that and just like buy bolt cable or whatever it would be nice uh the the beldin 6G or 12g stuff super flexible but you have to buy it on like 600t
rolls uh but uh maybe we could get that approved hey Andy Andy would you want that yeah yeah please please they're really nice let's talk about the RTX 4080 super shall we uh our review is going to be coming out but I've already looked at performance I've already looked at the script I've hosted the video so obviously I know a handful of things about it in a nutshell we had this uh we had this joke this was Adam's idea and I thought it was really funny where throughout the
entire video we had planned every time I said RTX 4080 super we were going to cut out the audio and then replace it with Tik Tock voice saying something like refreshed rehashed refried replaced like just anything any two- syllable something other than super Redux um to indicate that it is really not very different from the original RTX 4080 um but for clarity we ended up taking that out and we ended up just calling it RTX 480 super because nvidia's naming scheme has gotten confusing enough already
you've got the four digigit number you've got maybe nothing maybe TI maybe non-ti uh or sorry maybe TI maybe super maybe TI super that one hurts my brain TI super what are you even talking about um and so we didn't want to end up in a situation where it just wasn't clear what card we were talking about so we ended up calling it 480 super throughout the review uh but we were not very impressed by this things performance uplift over the original 4080 while it does have um while it does have more of
the die unlocked more of the die functioning what it doesn't have is an appreciably greater power limit so what ends up happening is that in gaming in particular that extra um those extra cacor end up costing us clock speed because we have to power them and so we found that in games performance was on par or in one case it was even a little bit lower than the standard RTX 480 which was a big disappointment now it's it's worth noting guys that just because our card our 480 super performed a little bit
lower than our 480 in one particular game doesn't necessarily mean that that would be your observation we did that really cool video recently where we looked at uh about a dozen of amd's ryzen uh 7800 x3ds and noted that the performance Delta across them was as great as I think we observed about 8% in factorio and that wasn't even our outlier ridiculously different csgo result and that's across chips with the exact same model number so conceivably if our 4080 super was at the bottom end
of a of a let's call it a sort of 2 to 8% spread and then r480 nons Super was at the top end of a spread like that can I twist this so they can just kind of see being installed um we you could easily have a 4080 that outperforms a 4080 super while everything is sort of you know normal and that 40 and the 480 super is still a faster card so it's gotten really it's gotten really challenging making recommendations these days and um and it's gotten really challenging I think for people to
understand exactly what the performance they should expect from from a product is so we were a little disappointed but we're also not going to just say you know Nvidia didn't update anything cuz on the one hand like yeah it is a slightly different car and it did perform measurably better in say for example uh AI workloads which is cool if you're someone who needs an affordable AI card and uh your work isn't buying it for you so you want to use a consumer grade card and the price is obviously more
appealing but I don't know man it's it's pretty hard for me to see how happy people are to see a "$1,000 GPU I mean it wasn't that long" ago that nvidia's 80 or you know 800 class card was you know $600 $500 six "$700 $1,000 is still a flipping lot of" money guys especially for something that is now Midway through its life cycle right like yeah it's it's it's super now or whatever but this is fundamentally the same die that Nvidia developed you know two years ago or whatever it was a
year and a half I can't remember exactly when they launched 40 series it's all been kind of a a blur it's like which crypto winter were we in at that point I  sure it's really fast though it's like ripping fast play all the 4K games I can't get this thumb screw in sorry it's it's really tall right it's got this gigantic cooler on it much of which we're not really going to be able to take advantage of it's got the pass through Cooling in the back here and it's it's a pretty tight it's a
pretty tight squeeze here hopefully hopefully our ventilation is going to be okay I'm going to I'm going to try and get in here in the meantime Dan do you want to hit me with another merch message hopefully you guys are enjoying the vibe of the stream today I actually have not been I have not been monitoring chat that much because I've been busy trying to figure out how to build this computer yeah I've been uh looking through any questions and stuff from there do you want to have a chat question or
something yeah hit me D this is by uh ohotnik uh any news on the development of the LT Mouse I Remember lonus showed an early prototype back when he was touring Creator Warehouse um it's not dead but it's definitely sidelined we have other higher priorities where I feel we are able to provide a more clear value proposition and uh we have a more obvious reason for putting the resources into building the  because we think it's a bigger Market or we think we could sell more of them I
mean a mouse is a really obvious one for us that I think we could be really successful with but it's more that we have some really good ideas for how to differentiate our product in these other categories and so they make more sense for us to prioritize it's it's a better I don't want this to be misinterpreted it's a better story that doesn't mean it's a fictional story it just means that it's a more cohesive message and a more um a more obvious positioning for the product in the market we have one thing
coming in particular that I'm really excited about because it takes something that I think people are finally starting to wise up to a little bit that is really disposable and treated as intentionally disposable by manufacturers and it makes it the last one you'll ever need TM like  breaks then it won't be the last one you ever need but it will be far more user serviceable and it will be far easier to extend its lifespan than anything else that's on the market right now and it's
taking a lot of work for us to do it because there's a lot of safety validation that has to go into that but I'm I'm really excited about what the team's doing and I think that you guys are going to lose your minds when you see it and be like wow this is so sensible why wasn't everybody doing this and the answer is because it's hard and you have to be motivated by something other than wanting to sell you a new one  later okay the GPU is in yay yay indeed uh Alex is this really your cable
management for this uh weing on I'm not trying to be judgmental but no everything that I've done so far is just stuff that I know I can kind of cram away I see and then once it's all sort of in there we can Alex do a bit more yes the thing you put in your notes here watch look look look at the notes hold on I'm going to go down oh damn it yep I know it says remember to plug in the 90° display port connector before putting in the GPU I had to scroll three  that dang it so I guess that's coming back out
heck yeah is there it no that's really not going in is it nope it isn't B there's um oh wait I have an idea maybe I can just take out the one side that would be a very line of solute oh wow that's really in there um oh yeah that's no that's not moving at all okay cool both sides are coming out all right Dan quick buy me some time uh uh uh uh hello L and d uh I guess Alex is here too don't forget about Alex I just watched the new video on the land Center is there an estimate on when lands could
start I'm graduating this year and a friend and I would love to come make it our senior trip thanks oh super cool I think that's a wonderful question for Chase uh Colin can you go find Chase chase you know who chase is Chase Jes like with yeah no he knows he knows he knows Chase names are a little bit hard for him because he's he's still kind of learning um and like I I don't know what is Chase is it a bank is it a person is it a thing you do when you're running after somebody so uh anything that has
kind of double meanings he's struggling with a little bit but he's he's making a lot of progress we're really proud of  all right let's uh which one is it still good is there a particular one that it should be maybe this one sure okay cool hopefully you mean yes and not sure sure is one of one of my trigger words when someone says sure it means I'm not going to think about it right now and I'm probably going to come back to you later and tell you that it's not right well speaking of which yeah uh
our first display capture is over HDMI oh so then we're not capturing well or we could just Yeet HDMI in there right now and it's there forever oh uh I don't think it's going  clearance I don't that there's no way there's no way yeah there's no way look oh yeah not even close here no I I'll show the people do you want to get a drill from 105 no I do not want to drill okay we are not taking a drill to this case I assure you that in spite of everything that you've seen so far it is if you
weren't here at the beginning okay it is a work of art and once we've got it put back together it's going to look absolutely gorgeous we may have stumpe cables or a right angle adapter fine we'll just live without screen cap oh okay okay Dan hit me oh yeah uh can you push that a little bit because that would make this a lot easier any interesting or favorite use cases you found for the upcoming magnetic Cable Management oh oh what was a really funny one I saw someone do the other
day oh yeah oh yeah in the workshop did you see that someone put two of the big ones on the back door the metal door no okay okay so um we have uh we're good uh we have door like uh security bars on the on the door at the back of the shop and so they're like the kind with like posts and they and they slide in you know here here here here here I'll show I'll show you what they look like basically like this y yep okay so there are security bars that make it harder to just like bash in a
door with your shoulder essentially so they go in like this onto the door and um so what they did was they took two of the big ones put them at an angle like this so that when you aren't using it to block the door you put them in the magnetic holders oh cool and they just stay on the back of the door instead of just getting hued on the floor so you then pull it out of the magnetic holder and then put it in place and they're strong enough that they're a little bit different from these ones but they're
similar in terms of ruggedness and it's it's holding them so I saw that and I thought it was hilarious this is the solution we have over on this side I have a more practical thing that's relatable for people sure that I use it for so on my desk the legs are metal and they come down from the corner and I have one just right at the top that Clips in my headphone cord as string relief so it's just right there and then if I need to take it out you just UNM magnet it you can take your headphones wherever and
then you just put it back in and clippy clip they are so useful uh lonus sir I got a picture of a scribbled note from Colin here uh it says can you tell lonus Chase is at Labs oh okay all right well Chase would know when our first land is going to be um they're telling us that building construction will be done probably sometime in the next two to three months which means 6 months so we would want to plan a land because we're going to have to give people notice for exact dates
that they can actually you buy tickets and be there so we can't have some vague timeline so with that in mind probably the first land will be I'd say late summer or early fall is our best bet that kind of make sense Dan does that kind of seem feasible yeah Dan's also going to be involved because not only will the build the the building construction have to be done but we'll have to get our networking equipment in there and set up in order to run a land pres yeah we do still have a lot of the
equipment from LTX but there's a lot of like backline infro that needs to get done steam cash stuff like that we can make it work we can make it work okay uh do you have LTT cable ties I'm allergic to these ones look how red my hands are just from touching in on LTT cable tie there you go I really like a zip tie for like a big bundle like this though so you um I'll make it work I will use the LTT cable tie and it will be grand a you're doing it like that yeah that's way you can cinch it see cinch
all right yeah he did that to all of the cables in my desk and it was horrible cuz every time that I needed to move one thing like even an inch after the Intel upgrade I'd have to like go underneath my desk like this to undo 14 of those cable ties okay look now it would all be magnets not all yeah yeah that's true we do have a solution for that that we've been working on you just you know you got your Intel upgrade a little  all and they're now AMD upgrades just want to clarify that a AMD ultimate Tech
upgrade not Intel extreme upgrade Tech upgrade I had wanted to find like a fun uh you know reuse of an AMD acronym or something like that for the AMD ones as well but I didn't have time to think about it and nobody else could think of anything so you know I just found on the table the SSD yeah the SSD no that'll be fine yeah that just goes right here it'll be yeah yeah that's easy we got this no problem since when do we have packs of four cable ties I don't know I was wondering about that too yeah what
what what even yeah wait here I got a whole thing got a whole thing here all right Dan hit me um okay um sorry wrong tab uh what's your opinion about the Apple Vision Pro is it the future or is it worth hyping now I want to try it we bought one obviously cuz there's no way we're going to like not cover it um I have a I have a deep interest in VR and augmented reality I am actually I have only gotten as far as reading the instructions and charging it but I just recently got my hands on the noo
noio the wireless adapter for the valve index so in a sense I'm not going to be comparing the Apple vision Pro just to a valve index or just to a meta Quest 3 or just to uh big screen Beyond because apple is going to be all about ecosystem it's going to be all about experience it's going to be all about what what are the use cases right and when you talk about the use cases for that product you have to talk about  $3500 okay The Vision Pro has some clear benefits right like it is a it is a cordless
solution mhm like a meta Quest 3 sort of got the the power Bricker whatever um but so is a valve index if you spend hundreds of dollars on a wireless adapter for it or you oh Andy can I help you yeah we have a top down oh we have a top down oh there you go oh right that makes sense haha look Let's uh let's use that for the first time in the Stream today yeah I forgot about that so you're also up against like a kitted out with third party accessories version of something that already exists and I
think that's a really interesting thing to talk about because on the one hand with something like a Vision Pro yeah I have the benefit of being able to use it anywhere in my house whereas with an index I got to set up base stations and and they got to have power and you got to be positioned and calibrate the room and all that crap right that makes VR kind of inaccessible but then with like I could I could also buy a a wireless adapter for it that's pretty cool are you just trying to trigger Andy by doing
peels no Andy hates peeling things um and then like the quest three man okay so here's something like VR is already inherently kind of a forever alone thing well the quest 3 doesn't have to be forever alone at that point you could buy I mean what what do it what does it work out to like six of them or something like that that okay one thing that I always find is if you have the choice between $60 game and4 $20 or $3 $20 games or whatever for you and your friends you will have so much more fun
with four of them and so let's talk about you know VR and AR what would be what would be better for for you and your and your and your your Bros right to all pick up meta Quest 3s and you know do room scale have like room scale AR experiences together or to sit and watch movies on your Vision Pro or FaceTime on your Vision Pro and like man you know how we talk a lot like in writer meeting or like when they when the uh when the business team will bring us a pitch for like a a sponsored video
on like a projector or something like that we talk a lot about how the marketing for projectors is super disingenuous not for the theater ones or the data ones that are intended for you know installation in a in a theater room or like house of worship or a conference room or something like that that those ones are generally fine the ones that I find really offensive are the lifestyle ones those ones are so good like remember that one that looked like a trash can and they just had it like
sitting on a coffee table in the middle  go where are the wires like even if you're even if you're casting from your phone or whatever oh terrible you're still going to need power for this thing especially if you're planning to watch you know Lord of the Rings extended cut or whatever like even the battery powered ones you're you're still going to need to plug them into power um and this is especially noticeable because a lot of the time these installations are not just it's sitting at the foot of the bed
projecting onto a blank wall you know there's a there's a fixed frame projector screen on the wall like this is clearly a permanent installation it's just it's silly right and apple is marketing The Vision Pro in a really similar hold on a second that's not realistic kind of way like this is a device that by Apple's own admission only gets a couple of hours of battery life or more maybe more than a couple but it certainly doesn't have all day battery and then they've got this uh
have you watched any of the of the vision materials the one with M doing her laundry yes packing for the trip right yeah yeah so she's just casually wearing her Vision Pro while she's packing for a trip and she gets a FaceTime call that she takes while she's  like look we all spent the last three years in you know remote work hell where okay I I had a teams meeting this morning it took nine minutes for everyone to get all their audio and video sorted out and to make that's also
a team's issue In fairness yeah in this case it wasn't though oh it was just stuff right and so I support the idea of just like Fast convenient easy video it's F video calling you know where everyone is just already ready to go and it just immediately works and and if Apple has managed to deliver that experience well that's really cool here's the power supply screws um but here's the thing apple is so ecosystem first that I have very little faith in that so coming back to my point about
how or I mean really was Alex's point about how much cooler it is for you and five of your buddies to have something where you're all on the same platform and how the Vision Pro is so expensive that realistically a lot of people are not going to invest into this platform I have some major concerns about who in my in my circle is even going to have a Vision Pro even if I do want to make the investment into it so who exactly is it that I'm going to be doing anything that
couldn't be equally handled by my iPhone with FaceTime or just a phone call um and you know there's the argument to be made for you know the expressiveness of of face to-face interactions but there is no face to-face interaction it's an animated version those are weird and okay pretty much everything that we take for granted technologically speaking today started out weird so I'm not even going to get too hung up on that one personally I don't disagree with you but I do find it a little unsettling at the
moment but you know even if we could get  just I think apple has a hugely uphill battle ahead of them in terms of the value of this platform and I think that the way that they're antagonizing app developers right now is not going to help app Developers are mad and oh this is a really interesting point that I saw in the I was reading an article about Apple's new app store policies that I thought was actually really well done I wish I could tell you guys which one it was where the devil is my knock to a
screwdriver um I can't find it uh I have backup screwdriver in my backpack I probably have backup screwdriver too I'm just really confused right now because it should be here you know what I I get it's probably fine I'll find it later thank you very oh that won't do oh Dan has an OCTA if you want that oh oh no I know where it is I found it I found it in my mind I put it back in my tech sack awesome uh what was I saying right yeah the way that Apple's antagonizing developers I think is going to be a
serious problem for them uh this in this article they pointed out that uh Instagram still doesn't have a dedicated app for iPad OS Apple sells tens of millions of iPads a year when you compare that to how many Vision Pros they're going to sell it's a tiny fraction right so why at a time when Apple is actively engaging in malicious compliance um around European regulations that are there to benefit app developers why do they think that anyone is going to want to spend the money to do them a solid and make
this a valuable platform Apple's first-party apps are not going to be enough to justify The Vision Pro and you can I will say that now having not even touched one yet that is just the case so I I don't know I think it's uh I think basically if Apple was a different company they would have called it a developer kit and this would be they would not even be trying to launch this as a as a retail product I I've said that before about the Apple watch where the first gen watch essentially was a
developer kit and that much was very clear after the fact when they basically disowned that thing uh series zero I think people call it now because they called the next one series one like okay sure uh and like the first gen iPad was like that too I think it got a couple ios's and then the iPad 2 got like seven you know like the first one was just the first gotten child absolutely it's like hey yeah in our culture firstborn yeah you're the you're the lowest here hi how you doing not too bad yeah
that actually looks a fair bit better yeah I think if we could stuff more of this behind the power we're working on he's working on okay Dan um why don't you hit me after I do a quick shout out for our sponsor xplit not everyone has a super cool background that they can use on their streams but with xits vcam program that might not be necessary anymore it'll let you remove replace or blur your webcam background during a video call live stream or recording so your audience won't need to be
constantly staring at your unkempt bed for hours on end or oh man did you see that one recently where um it was like a very serious political stream and then this like guy who looks like he just woke up and like chugged like half of a six-pack just like walks through the frame anyway um heck you can even use the xplit Connect app on your phone and turn it into a webcam if you're in a pinch so check it out at the link below and save 69% using Code Linus um and at every end of the stream once again this
is sponsored by xplit uh yeah that's so we were supposed to do that read like when this computer was working but that's fine oh okay well it'll work we got ahead yeah yeah we're ahead we're ahead on the stream you'd never know it from how long it was taking but hey it looks pretty good yeah uh I'm a little worried about that side panel stand we need to move these a bit I see um you know what we could do is we could cable tie them yeah down here you got a cable tie uh I definitely do oh I do
nice all right how do we want to you want to go that way yeah um I mean this is not going to be our finest Cable Management either of us but here if I hold it here do you want to secure it uh sure wait oh balls now Dan hit me sure uh what's it getting secured too first we're just securing them together I would go the other way so you don't rip up the um the breeding oh but then the L logo yeah  yeah um you just want that yeah sure hi LDA Tech is obviously getting better and
more powerful aside from performance do you feel like we have already hit and passed a golden age of the tech World also ever considered a thumb ratchet I've never considered a thumb ratchet as for the Golden Age I think every generation kind of feels like theirs was the Golden Age and you know looks back wistfully at the way that they did things uh there's definitely things that I feel like really have golden aged already uh  really I I strongly object to all of the the gambling that is so prevalent in in
gaming now and when I say gaming I mean man I it's not even just gaming right like the the idea of having constant advertising for gambling on like sports broadcasts and stuff like that that would have been Unthinkable when I was a kid and it does feel a little bit like you know back when I when my day we didn't uh we didn't think you had to gamble on on every game and whatever else but uh um yeah I'm the obsession with in-game cosmetics and and gambling on them I I do think is
something that is is not Golden Era of gaming compatible for me but in terms of tech no I I think it just kind of keeps getting better and I don't know I think Gaming's gotten really good cuz a lot of that was I feel more of a problem like two years ago and everyone got mad enough that a lot of the games that came out last year just completely got rid of like microtransactions and stuff I me that's a fair point you kind of make your own gaming experience these days because you
can play any game from any era and you can choose to only play games from developers Like Larry and Studios that refuse to embrace that nonsense and there's so much variety now I mean yeah I think there's a solid argument there but one thing that I will counter with is the prevalence of developer only servers compared to priv bad one like you will never be able to play in 20 years when epic is bored of fortnite 20 years is a long time there's no way you won't be able to go
back and play fortnite with your friends like you did when you were a kid and that sucks that really sucks I I I really don't like that but other than that I think the I think the litness test is think about some kind of tech that you had when you were a kid or even 5 years ago you know 5 10 20 30 years ago if you could would you throw away your current solution to that problem and go back to it right would I throw away my Sono setup and my phone with you know YouTube music on it and go back to
my disman no that would suck and I'm not talking about people who are very into the you know the experience of vinyl records and who like the artwork and and like to collect um I'm not talking about collection I'm talking about the technology the technology of vinyl records is not better than the technology of streaming um artists might have something to say about that yeah artists make a lot more money on records and CDs so artists are biased but that's a separate conversation um and it's like I I
recognize my own biases in all of this obviously streaming has been very good to me YouTube is a great platform to build a career on which is is something I don't think anyone thought they were ever going to say back when it first  um but I think by and large on demand streaming is a superior experience compared to what I had to do like if I wanted to hear a song again on demand I had to wait for it to play on the radio and then I had to go and run like this is as a kid right um where
like I didn't have 20 bucks to spend on every CD that came out so if I wanted to hear a song again especially if I wasn't that into the artist I had to wait for it to come on on the radio I had to dash to my tape deck press record hope that I had you know primed it already so that it was on like the next Blank Spot on the tape and then if I wanted to listen to it over and over again and I am that kind of person where I'll get like kind of hooked on a song I I got really good
at like playing the playing the rewind button knowing about how long I needed to hold it in order to rewind a song or whatever that that was what I had to do and it's like would I go back to no no of course not that would be that would be ridiculous compared to at a moment's notice being able to conjure up basically any song I could ever want to hear and being able to load up you know a sound hound or Shazam or whatever people use for that these days and identify any song that's playing
anywhere near me I mean Google does it natively now that's so awesome yeah but so so cuz remember you don't get to pick and choose you don't get to say okay well yeah I would I would like to have vinyl records but I'd also love the convenience of just like having my phone identify a song and immediately download and stream it for me sure you can I do that every day that wasn't the question though would you go back to would you give up everything you have now to go back to the old way the answer is
absolutely not not even close not even for a moment but okay occasionally in fact just the other day I went through and was re thumbing through my Final Fantasy 6 manual physical games yeah I that's what makes me kind of appreciate what people are into with the whole record thing uh personally I am I'm too efficiency-minded to actually use a physical cartrid like I would emulate a game when I own the console and I own the cartridge I would just emulate it I'm sorry I'm not I'm not getting up and
going and plugging that thing and that is just absolutely not happening it's not my jam but I get it I get the colle ctor aspect of it so I went through my Final Fantasy 6 manual because I was giving it to Luke he's playing it it's one of my favorite games that he had never played and so we have a deal where I'm playing Titanfall 2 watching uh Pirates of Silicon Valley and watching hackers which are some of his most beloved media and then he has to play Final Fantasy 6 um and so I wanted to give him my my
manual because I know he's super into like physical game boxes and and manuals and and artwork and stuff like that and they really were cool like the the concept Dart was so uh was so much more important back then when the finished game looked absolutely nothing like it cuz you had like you know what 30 pixels for a Sprite or you know 50 maybe um so you see this you see this drawing of what Tara Branford is supposed to look like and you're like oh that's so cool I can kind of see it anyway sorry uh what
can I do for you uh so it's peripherals time because we're about to turn on the computer yes we are I guess do you want to just turn on the computer first h sure yeah uh do we have a monitor in in mind oh do you have it already or oh no okay which one the G the G the gigabyte one the G oh this one yeah okay we need a display port which yes we do no I got oh yes no this is HDMI in here yeah uh Dan do you want to hit us with another merch message while we uh buy some time oh one one more thing you should talk
about the SSD or I can it was a Sab rocket 4 plus 8 tbte which chose it because I had already installed Windows on it and also there's only two m.2 spots on there so uh lots of storage how'd you end up with such a baller utility drive 8 terab rocket 4 plus I walked down in the warehouse and picked  up like a $900 drive but whatever uh "1,500 actually" sure oh yeah sure correct him oh wow okay uh this is not necessarily the most elegant system but if it's stupid and it works it's not
stupid check this out that right angle   okay maybe if you had five months to build a case um you know a back panel pass through with uh you know what what would they be male to female extenders or something like that embedded in it might be nice cuz it'd be a little easier to hook up dual monitors that way but this works and you could still you could still do dual monitors if you did a right angle one on the one side and a left angle one on the other side oh yeah yeah left angle is a thing by the way
that's a that's a term is there something flying around in here what I thought I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye maybe going there's a bat or a bird that got into the studio okay it doesn't matter the point is that left angle is a thing that exists it's the opposite of right angle uh Dan hit me are we ready are we we ready to start the system I just throw it up also no that's not a thing by the way here we go and naturally there's no RGB pretty much whatsoever because this is a classy
build not classy with an i it's going to be a little bit on the motherboard I guess Oh Hey where's our side panels at oh Do not drop Do not drop don't do it man every time we do one of these streams I'm all we should do these more often these are fun and then every time it's two or three months before we do another one I don't know why that is why does that keep happening hey it boots though fantastic 4700k all 32 gigs of RAM running at a measly DDR 54000 yuck we're going to fix that and
new CPU installed awesome okay Dan go ahead and hit me oh where did I actually am not sure that I have any more I think we've gotten through all of them okay uh let me hang in the chat and I've got I've got one here from jawood juice sure uh they say uh tea it's it's just a lowercase te take what off that's it the panel that's all they that's all they said okay sorry I'm listening Dan that's fine uh yeah I'm not entirely sure anybody else got any last minute  guys those uh fans are plugged into the
power supply directly or are they plugged into some kind of fan controller uh they're plugged into the CPU header oh that's odd uh I also turned off CPU fan detection because it was annoying me earlier cuz it wasn't plugged into there okay so we can fix that yeah we can fix it okay do you want me to do that while you talk through these peripherals that you're so KY about no okay we we can just finish this okay sure uh it's not quite in place there it is okay get no no I'll oh jeez
no no I got this i got this it's all   infectious I guess uh any Nas software updates probably nothing yet no yeah I didn't think so actually yes uhoh but no but yes the update is that I will hopefully have an update for you in the form of screenshots in the coming probably month or so and I I talked to I've talked to them about it I basically said okay look uh the people on Wow are asking about this they're really curious about what you guys are doing when's the soonest we
can show them something and they were of the mind that it might be better to wait until we have a functional demo like not not demo even like like almost like a a pre-alpha where it kind of works and we'd be able to go through the setup Wizard and everything ourselves um and I basically was like okay but that's probably going to take a long time can we do anything a little earlier and they said okay well we can at least show people what the design is going to look like and I was I was pretty into that uh
okay I still don't have peripherals though coming back to oh yes the actual task at hand here Alex what cars are you looking forward to this year anything uh let me think oh there's the new Porsches that are electric those are probably fun oh the mechan V yeah uh yes but there's there's also the is there a Cayenne or not a Cayenne a a Cayman electric Maybe is there I don't think that's coming this year I think that's later uh but what is probably also coming this year is um or either this year or next year
is a tyan turbo GT which is supposed to be oh yes stupid new nurburg ring record two seconds behind the NAA and I think it's like 10 seconds faster than the plaid or something like that like she's spicy she's spicy ionic 5 apparently oh yeah ionic 5n right seems cool honestly the ones that I am simultaneously most excited about but also most disappointed in are some of the really cool stuff from the Chinese Brands yes like which one is it it's not BD it's a Neo that makes that like hyper
car gowing looking one that someone has an early Impressions video up now of and they were kind of disappointed with which is unfortunate for a car that's "$150,000 but then the specs like the onp" paper specs are mindboggling so I just I just want to try it I'm just I would never buy it but I'm super curious anyway tell me about this why do we have this this looks like it came from the tech shop it came from mibc so someone actually had a return for a water bottle and they sent this back do you
want to just read it it was addressed to me but you can give it a read mibc is our distribution warehouse like our third party Logistics warehouse for LTT store uh so they sent this with their water bottle return Yes for Alex viewer alleged worst typing experience ever useful for a YouTube short or a float plane exclusive for Alex reacts 2 for comedic value times one take on phone camera quick and dirty not worth more than that also could be used as a lonus penalty gimmick in a video I estimate the value
at $0 cuz nobody is going to want to use this no I did not do that to the USB cable your guess is as good as mine uh okay enjoy the Linus proof packaging all shipping material has been used at least once before keep please keep reusing it to keep it out of the landfill love it um okay so I guess I'm being punished for some reason I don't think I did anything wrong today and I did let let the stream go a little bit over time I think Vance is hovering now waiting for me to be done yeah it's just
about 3:00 is that okay I don't know is that is that a joke yes it is actually a joke I'm sorry okay I mean that's kind of neat right yeah it folds which is a thing that it does um it locks Matias was one of those brands that one of our people at NC was like yeah these guys great I'm like that's that's just a normal ass mechanical keyboard what's special about this thing it's it's for Mac what does what does that even mean uh anyway this is a folding keyboard it doesn't seem to
really lock and position particularly well there's a little springloaded thing here that seems to be designed to keep it there but it does an okay job as long as it stays flat on it on the table okay oh there doesn't seem to be oh yeah that is confusing somebody folded this cable and then put heat shrink on it I couldn't even begin to  that cool okay what are my other peripherals and why why are we doing this oh I just thought it was funny oh I see I do have other keyboards if you
want something no no I insist on gaming on it now the thing that really got me is just how much hair there is in it and you didn't comment on that which I found    yeah yeah that's gross um okay you brought the bamboo wireless mouse yeah from the Allwood PC but then you also brought something really good yeah uh which one do you want are we going bamboo we can go bamboo but also it's like kind of terrible so I kind of just want to use the pulser instead I'm going bamboo all
right maybe I'll just do maybe I'll just do the opposite of what Alex wants for the rest of this stream it's my That's My Punishment back at him giving me this keyboard okay what else we got I don't think I need uh audio peripherals really would hate a   one the good news is I am not in charge  anymore all right so are we just going to go for it XMP enabled and see what happens sure okay I'm a little confused by this it shows up as ddr5 4000 here and then 5600 here but that's cool and
"the speed is 5,500 there okay and it" goes to 7200 if we enable XMP let's just see if it just immediately Works what  10 you're not going to you're not going to guess what our odds are I've already tested it so I know the answer oh well that's no fun lus has a history of putting things together that have been tested and then they don't work anymore look he knows I'm he knows I'm right that actually happened very recently with the um what was the PC that we just that we
just built that didn't post and then and then it did no no it wasn't it wasn't thread Ripper there was an AMD thing that you uh you didn't wait long enough for it to post cuz it takes like 3 minutes to do the ram train was that was that it I don't I'm not sure remember there was there was definitely a recent one I think Elijah was involved oh that makes sense I don't know anymore oh so it just immediately worked apparently wow is that what you were expecting uh yes oh good okay well
that's amazing do we have other XMP profiles if we want can I please quiet these fans good gravy that's annoying uh how sure are you that you're plugged into the CPU header and not the pump header because that should not be that loud any  buddy are these four pin fans plugged into a three pin extension by any chance uh no it's a four pin extension okay well we're going full loud then because we're already booted into Windows all right Dan you got any other comments yeah sure I think I got one
last curated one here hey lonus and Alex if you had to pick a piece of software and would get to force the developer to add one feature what software or feature would you pick apple and side loing oh that's a good one got him can I choose valheim and the game just getting the updates oh salt I love it ouch by the way speaking of ouch this is quite possibly the worst keyboard I've ever typed on yeah did you try it before the stream uh it's really bad it has I would say individually no key is
the worst that I've ever touched but it has by far the least consistency out of any keyboard I have ever touched listen  friends okay can you can you hear that guys y  God so when you're typing you have no idea how hard to press because any key could be any Force requirement could you move it up I yeah I can I can yeah I can move it okay so let's get Hardware info up here going hard then GPU temperatures let's throw up our CPU temperatures oh man this is not going to struggle it's like like 29 degrees right
now or something stupid like that okay GPU y good and uh doometernal I guess is the game we have we have many games but we do have Doom Eternal as well oh we need to update the Nvidia driver oh no uh Jaa juice has suggested the typing inconsistency might be the hair well I'm not going to try and get it out because the only tool I have on hand is my tongue you know you want there actually not that there's not any hair over on this side so I really don't I actually don't think so no it's just a really
truly awful keyboard uh I don't have internet oh yeah that that's good oh wait we we don't even need it we don't I they downloaded the drivers yesterday and then because the card wasn't released and video got mad at me oh really no not actually like the drivers were just like unsupported C oh got it got it got it got it got it and I could have gone to Gary and got the ones that Nvidia sent us but I'm going to hang out with Dan while we wait hi Dan hi how you doing going how's chat doing yeah chat's doing
well they want you to lick it yum mem lus tongue tool I am not going to lick the keyboard see this Elijah says you should you what is Elijah okay now you have to he's been chatting the whole time he's waiting for you apparently I think you got to do something after this lunch after this is what I have after this Elijah yeah um you guys wonder why we talk to the merch message people this is what Happ the merch message this is what happens when we talk to General chat you should twitch
is just oh no no no that can't no yeah no Seether Quality quality of interaction  chat twitch chat and then somewhere below the floor would be YouTube chat for these live streams it's just it's like a a law of the universe lick the chat one does not speak of twitch all right never mind I'm going to come hang out with Alex I think you picked well I take don't come don't come back over here okay yeah that's Nvidia installer cannot continue we need to get the new ones oh good wait but the card's publicly
released now it should be yeah it's it's available now okay cool we have fast internet that is now done uh you know what why don't I monitor chat myself and see if Dan's just curating the very worst I wouldn't put it past him no this you read it yourself I will I'm going to read it  interactions lus if you and Alex had to debate the best approach to passively cooling an RTX 490 what would it be CU we saw that come up on Reddit recently where someone is trying to passively
cool a 40 or 3090 I think or 3080 or something like that yeah with a giant hunk of copper that has a bunch of CPU heat sinks strapped to it and Alex and I were discussing that because I don't know as much about this as he does but I think I know enough to know that that won't work plan because copper even though we think of it as being extremely conductive uh both electrically and thermally is not that conductive compared to if we take that thermal energy and we put it in some
liquid evaporate it have it go somewhere and then condense and then run back like that moves heat real fast so you had some thoughts about how we could actually take that project idea and turn it into a reality right I want he I think it was Vapor chamber with heat pipes on top how on Earth would we get a vapor chamber that big oh you don't need to the vapor chamber only needs to be like this big and then you just heat pipe the other stuff oh I see but the heat pipes are also just so you don't dry out the
vapor chamber which is like a pretty big problem right and so by dry out the vapor chamber you mean that so much heat is going into it that can't be moved and dissipated that it just is all evaporated yeah and also Vapor Chambers can do weird things where one area can get really hot and not get cooled while the rest sort of stays cool I see it's weird anyway I made that up that was not a message in the chat they were meing about licking things I just I was teasing Dan I told you I told you did did the
system crash just reboot what did that just did something just happen while we were talking about Vapor Chambers uh I it crashed during the driver install which is like a really bad time for yeah it's it's not happy at all uhoh so you know how I said that I tested the ram before it was like not perfect it kind of act a little bit strange at time it absolutely crashed during the driver install okay uh you know what it's pretty it's not the fault of the case let's just have a look at the cool oh the Ram's
mad oh jeez uh you going get a closeup oh oh oh do we have a system we don't here Andy come look at the pretty computer oh it's very unhappy all right we're we're going into the bio dang it Alex oh all right there it is finished computer I actually really like the look of the back of it these 3D printed grills ended  awesome and as much as I kind of want to meme on the RTX 480 super for being still really expensive and not really being that super compared to the regular
480 the new all black paint job really  awesome so the fan says it's spinning at 600 RPM right now which one this one which I think the bottom one is and the top one isn't that top one is "going that's like at least 2,000 RPM" "maybe 3,000 I'm not sure which FAS these" are that's fine realistically I don't  Alex okay what are you setting the ram to uh I'm seeing if we have any options oh we do oh how many different XMP profiles does it have oh man one of the frequencies we can choose is 7800 MHz
I'm sure that would work right great to be clear we're not blaming the RAM for this it's very possible that's somewhere between possible and probable that it is validated for 7800 uh the issue is that you have to have a CPU that has a strong enough integrated memory controller that it can handle these speeds anything above J deck is technically overclocking and anything above what Intel and AMD recommend in their literature is definitely overclocking uh what did you "settle on I went for 7,000 really it's"
it was like pretty close before all right and that still is like it's a nice number sure Transit biker wants us to swap the ram disc or the RAM sticks between the two slots that shouldn't matter if you've had success with that in the past I would say it's more likely that it was simply reting the memory that made the difference selmore says if that doesn't work try 6900 MHz yeah I definitely should have just gone to that the real B bam doesn't want us to finish without a working PC like okay yeah we're not
going to personally I don't think it really matters we only intended for it to be pretty and made of wood I don't think that anyone actually cares what the performance is the performance is what a 4080 and uh uh core i7 14th gen is but no okay people disagree okay they want a working computer no yeah we we need a working well Windows is not happy no Top Gear 1224 I will not be upgraded to the tyan GT that would be a spectacularly wasteful upgrade it's already more car than I pretty much know what to do with
man what now that okay see Advanced rep oh uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then just continue yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it'll be fine I don't know yeah I might be bored yeah the the NVIDIA drivers are really really unhappy bad memory is a really easy way to Brick uh Windows install come on come on how many instances of Crisis can it run simultaneously right now zero okay so yeah it's it's a oh oh we got further than last time we have a spinny ball that's yeah it crashed any plans to
visit the hner data centers in Europe not at the moment I actually don't have any plans to travel to Europe Taco asks if there's an update on the Badminton Center branding yes um ooh let me see if I can find it I might be able to find that for you guys I'm uh turning off XMP for now okay and then we're going to try and go into like safe mode oh my goodness that's fine I'll try  you uh bedminton operations okay I think I'm shared on a folder for all the stuff to do with  but I I don't know what it is I can't
find anything in Google Drives these days in Google Drives in Google Drive these days I've been having that problem too it's it's been extremely frustrating smash CH okay yeah here's a folder maybe it's in here uh Partnerships that chart  confirmation drop in and whatever we're doing work we're doing work I assure you we're doing work I just don't know where any of it is because it's not really uh it's not really me who's handling it day to day oh oh I've got something
okay personal done waiver Biz proposal I  it we just blue screened FYI oh no dang it well okay here's the old here's the first deck that Sarah put together just kind of asking for some some guidance um you know do you want something that's more bold do you want something that's more you know sporty or something more fun and trendy uh but we have we have new progress since then let me go let me okay let me see I'll see if  here Dan do you have any good ideas of what to do here get the NVIDIA drivers happy
what seems to be going on uh so the computer crashed while we were doing an Nvidia driver update okay and now the drivers are completely borked uh you'll have to use like uh ddu I guess rip them out in safe mode yeah safe mode with networking ddu and then install them that way oh let me get your mic back on there you go oh Advanced options uh troubleshoot how do I get into stupid God I hate it uh you need to go like Advanced startup or something like that is that no I forget it used to be so
easy oh yeah ADV Advanced options Advanced options yeah this is where I was yeah startup settings and then yeah go that make sure yeah so hit next and then it'll reboot and then you'll need to go into uh safe mode with networking  Nukem uh let's see man it was amazing to me how many people's comments on that video were just like badminton is a thing like yes there were some really good suggestions though um a lot of people brought up pickle ball pickle ball is like I think the fastest growing sport
in the US right now or something like that it's crazy fun if you guys haven't tried it before it's an absolute blast um I've only played a couple of times but I just was it I jumped right in and was like having an amazing time it's it's actually legitimately really fun and it doesn't require it doesn't have nearly the same cardio requirements as a sport like tennis or one like badminton so pretty much anyone can get into pickle ball which is one of the reasons that it's getting so popular because
seniors are playing a lot of pickle ball so super cool uh yes that's a very good idea and yes that is something that uh we are planning on offering so particularly in the mornings we were thinking it' be cool to have one side segmented off for pickle ball and then the other side for badminton the court lines are almost identical uh and we have confirmed that the flooring material we're using which is going to be a um a rubber anti-shock Layer Two plywood layers and then a synthetic
sport floor layer over top uh it behaves quite well with the whiffle ball that they use for pickle ball so there's only one difference in the lines the line for the kitchen which is you could think of it kind of like a crease um so the line for the kitchen which is like a keep out Zone really close to the net to keep you from just standing right at the net and just whacking things down is I think about 6 in closer than or farther from the badminton service line so we were kind
of just thinking I don't know if pickle ball people care that much they can bring a piece of masking tape and put it down while they play or if they don't care care that much then neither do we and they can just have a slightly differ sized kitchen uh but other than that the facility will be compatible and we're going to try and come up with a way to quickly and easily move our Nets up and down that's another compromise they'll be badminton Nets probably because pickle Bell Nets are more like tennis
Nets they use a like a like a braided steel uh cable for the top and they're quite a heavier Duty net but realistically it's a whiffle ball people aren't hitting it that hard if you have a bad Minon net it's probably fine it just means that in instances where it hits the top of the net it hits the tape and it kind of rolls over it'd be a little easier for that to happen with a badon style net so there could be some some purists who would prefer to play pickle ball somewhere else
um but yeah I know that it's not really that big of a thing in North America but badminton is huge outside of North America and it's a really great sport it's really fun uh is he going to send me that document or that link hey uh Vance can you please check with jquan when and how he's going to send that because I I need it like right now if I maybe he maybe he didn't understand I meant so that I could show people on stream right like  second uh what style of Nets are you using they're going to be just the
really heavy bases we've already sourced them from Victor uh do you plan on bringing beatsaber streams back yes I just have been really busy I have not had time I I do plan to do them some more Dan has a question uh yes Dan how are we going to protect the floor for the land parties we aren't okay so that was the reason that we ultimately or I shouldn't say the reason that was a major reason that we ultimately went with a synthetic sport floor rather than a hardwood floor if it was hardwood and
someone I don't know someone's roller chair had a wheel fall off and they put a big gouge in it I would be so sad so so sad uh whereas with a synthetic sport floor they're pretty robust this is the same kind of thing that typically gets used in like an elementary school gym and in fact the very product that we're using I went to an elementary school to see it installed it had been there for I think about eight or nine years grab a chair drive it across daily use uh had
had the just the crap kicked out of cuz not only did they use it all day for school uh but they rented out the gym for events at night and yeah yeah it looked great makes a lot of sense great um and they will often you know whether it's for um a Christmas concert or whatever else often drag chairs and tables and stuff out onto it yeah nobody's going to care right so we are definitely going to want to be cognizant of that our chairs and our tables we're going to want those caps for the bottoms
of them so so that we're not just beating it up for no reason at all and we'll have control about chairs coming into the the building and things like that right but if you guys were looking at me going wellz sir are we going to be able to do chair curling my answer is would it be a land party without chair curling hell yeah yeah so yeah we're there there were a lot of different options that we considered and we ended up with this because it worked for  parties wasn't cheap but it was versatile so this is
really messed up yeah uh I booted into  yeah what is Asus system product name yeah uh but I got ddu uh through my laptop on a USB drive we have it now hopefully when this restarts it comes back and it like is a system cool in the meantime we can do some more Q&amp;A this is fun uh when should he sent to you on teams oh send to me on teams oh I don't have teams open because I'm streaming well there's your problem right there lonus all right task that that makes sense here we 
goodness time to sign into to things man I just uh Andy do you mind going a different direction while I type my  okay cool oh we have a we have a computer again heyy look at that a desktop wallpaper there's no networking um H minor issue maybe it'll figure itself   okay okay so so there's a handful of options I'll I'll show you his his personal uh I won't say favorite I don't think it's necessarily his favorite so uh okay if you're in the local badminton Community you might know Jonathan Quan
he's going to be working at smash Champs so he's been doing a lot of uh behind the scenes stuff in the leadup to launch um he's a super passionate guy can't say enough good things um yeah hi jquan if you're watching this anyway so he actually has a background in graphic Des design and has been working on some logos and stuff in addition to just some of the more operational um operational things for us and this one was one that he thought was really cool cuz it kind of merged uh you know badminton and the
kind of bold look that we had said we wanted from the previous deck and Technology because it has like a QR code that could go straight to our Pro Shop or to um booking our website so if we were to put our logo on things like water bottles and t-shirts um you know anyone could just be wearing the logo and someone could be like oh yeah smash Champs where's that oh I don't know just scan my shirt with your code and I was like that's really cool in a 2009 you know 2010 11 kind of way but
why don't we go with something that's a little bit more kind of straight into the point so here's another option that I really liked thought was really cool and then the one that is probably closest to what  one so nothing too far outside the box or anything like that but pretty clean  of Y I think we're probably going to move the medor style shuttle up here uh make these speed lines a little bit shorter so that it fits more tidy into a square or a rectangle you know like
logos do but that's kind of pretty close   yeah really excited about it a lot of people have asked why uh am I not allowed to just am I not allowed to just you know think a sport is really cool and be passionate about it and you know want there to be a place for people to play and dang it anywhere other than Richmond where all the clubs are uh there's a couple in Port kitum but other than that there's pretty much nothing outside of Richmond and uh it's been a big frustration for people in our
community because the community centers here have run only a couple sessions a week they fill up like that like seriously if you are not on the phone with the number already dialed ready to press go or if you're or on the website with everything filled out ready to press submit you won't get a spot and it just it sucks so we'll have an actual  now where the heck we're not opening a  uh thanks for the update uh secret Labs put NFC tags on the chairs could add that to merch yeah yeah 
cool people are talking about live music in the chat Alex is working on ethernet Drive first we could just game over Wi-Fi that's really bad sure I have antennas oh yeah we can sell the antennas then it would be Wi-Fi that's kind of good uh at least there's supposed to be a bin of antennas here oh I thought you meant the motherboard box oh I mean that makes sense too that's also an option I wouldn't have thought of it but it's good here we go perfect yeah so  oh it's oh oh no I love how this went
from build a computer stream to troubleshooting stream well actually that's how it always goes first it went to shoot the breeze stream then it went to troubleshooting stream there's briefly I install a radiator for 40 minutes or whatever stream all right oh man do you want to game on it I I would love to you can wrap this thing up show the people actually first tie a nice little bow on it or or do we go and enable XMP again nope nope not even a  yep all right we've got Hardware info
yeah how's our cooling going to look probably pretty solid I mean that's a 280 mil radiator it's going to hit 100 degrees but that's just cuz it's Intel  it see 96 yep and heaven forbid the water heat up a little bit you can actually see it right on the cooler Andy 99 it's good number strong number but it still is drawing 300 watts so like the cooler is doing its job mhm what that means is that we could experience some thermal slowdown if we had our GPU running Full Tilt because it
would be drawing hot air into the radiator which would heat our liquid which would mean that if we're hitting 100° now then it would want to hit 105 or 110° if the coolant were 5 or 10° warmer um that's going to cost us some power but for gaming unlikely to make a difference also uh "32,000 incen bench is pretty darn" good so I think we can say that CPU is working oh sorry Andy yeah Andy missed it that's okay all right what do we want to play we can play whatever you want 
infinite if I can win with this mouse I can win with anything oh yeah the keyboard too oh gosh this keyboard what oh wait what oh wa we still need to install the NVIDIA drivers oh I forgot about that I was just really happy that it was like working is it this one yeah nice and hopefully it won't crash again  plus oh man normally this stuff happens  it there's one thing that I like it's unstable Ram I don't understand why it's struggling with heat so much ventilation looks like it should be good question
mark question mark from Alexander um it's not struggling with heat well it is struggling with heat but not in the way that you might think it has nothing to do with the ventilation of the case this case is doing a great job of having almost a completely open back and then almost a completely open front that it can draw air across the entire system and then exhaust it out the front the problem is that Intel's current approach to CPU design has them building these monolithic dyes that have these super
dense cores in them so the actual area so so even though the CPU is this big the die is only like I don't know about this big and then the actual compute on the gu is like some subset of it cuz the rest of it is connectivity or the GPU memory controller all that sort of thing so most of the heat most of the power comes from those transistors that are Computing well well that that it's all coming out of this tiny little area and like we were saying earlier copper is only so conductive it's actually not
that conductive so what we're trying to do with a liquid cooler did it just crash again while doing the drivers I'm not sure maybe so what we're trying to do with a liquid cooler is we've got yeah a copper  that's pretty conductive and allowing that heat to come off of those off of those cores and then into the coolant where it gets cycled up to the radiator and the heat is dispersed to the surrounding air and then presumably is a little bit cooler when it gets brought
back to the CPU but there's a bottleneck there as as that heat has to pass through the integrated heat spreader on the CPU as it has to pass through the copper the copper base as it then has to pass from the copper to the water there's an efficiencies there you can only move that heat so fast so that's why you can have an epic server CPU that draws 400 watts and runs at like 55° cuz it's huge and the cores are all over the place there's so much more area to pull that heat away from the CPU
through whereas this thing it's like this big and all that heat is concentrated there so if you could take like uh if you could put theoretically if you could put liquid nitrogen in a syringe and just it at that spot that would actually work a lot better than trying to use you know ambient cooled liquid with a with a copper plate in  but this is what we have this is reality so Intel either needs to move towards uh like a tiled CPU design that's less dense or they're going to have to get
their power consumption of their transistors down I have a new theory yes how good do you think that Riser is oh and is it Gen 4 good cuz my guess is that's probably why it crashed all right yeah let's go Gen 3 well that makes sense driver oh it's under um uh I think it's just miscellaneous I was already in Mis yeah yeah platform MK configuration and then uh just have to go down a bunch like I feel like it should be in here yeah okay it was definitely in miscellaneous on the board that's in my
system cuz I just had to change this in the NCI PC yeah in mine it was like or the last one that I used it was down here somewhere try PCI subsystem no that's like above 4 okay  go figure it out yeah we're just going to go into all of them he's a smart boy is there a search I have I don't remember time when I've checked what about APM what's APM I don't know one war devices would seem like one that I know oh it could be like um a PC PCH thing PCH and system AG up at the top pess really only the m.2 ones are
configurable there oh okay that kind of makes sense because those would be the ones that are connected through the iub okay well sorry Alex where the heck is it we're just going to have to play find the setting we're looking for in the Bios like it makes no sense that there would be in any of these but I just kind of have to check them at this point yeah PCI subsystem settings that's where would want to look for it yeah it's not in CPU configuration right cuz technically those lanes are running off 
so wouldn't be in here but no I don't know n h it wouldn't be an AI tweaker like make no sense it's got to be in advanced somewhere let's see chat's probably  uh no it seems people mostly just agree that it's really stupid that this is not that hard to find lonus was like why  later uh they said it should be where bifurcation is but I didn't see it there yeah cuz that was in PCH that was in here PCH press configuration is just grayed out m two link speed we can  H yeah so it seems like it is actually
just right here but is grayed out which is kind of concerning  neat uh can I just drive for fun for a sec sure yeah you you can do whatever you want I will happily not use that keyboard yeah it's pretty awful okay so let's look at AI tweaker just in case you know tweaker Paradise sometimes has weird stuff yeah it's definitely weird stuff in there but I don't see anything related to that it shouldn't be here it should just be in platform miscellaneous  okay system agent yeah no it shouldn't
be any of this it should be where we  looking here we go oh my God okay so what was that under I don't know okay I just started methodically going down everything and opening every menu until I found it like honestly that's the most it's the most practical way to deal with this these days because you know in my mind pcie would be under like CPU configuration or uh PCI subsystem yeah like that's in my logic that's where I would put something like that but no I don't know it's wherever that
was that's how I bios yeah exactly clip it twitch chat so we'll all know where it is from now on all right let's try and install this bloody driver I would also say let's just redownload the drivers in case it just corrupted when it it shouldn't it shouldn't oh in fact oh it's just working in fact it managed to install before it crashed well that's  folks you know in some ways I think this is some of the most valuable content we do though because it gives people that look behind the curtain at the the like
the troubleshooting so they don't feel bad when they go through the same thing with their system oh yeah it doesn't get easy like nothing we do Works ever yeah yeah yeah like everyone has problems guys that's why honestly one of the I think the most valuable things that Labs could do in the longer term is put together like you know how we did that uh video benchmarking different communities like PC choices so we did PC part picker r slash build a PC for me LTT Forum did we
do one more I think it was just the three we we got I got Reddit I don't know yeah I think it was just the three uh anyway the point is that that was really cool but the problem with those things is that that person who's recommending that has not actually plugged that thing onto that thing in many cases and so what I think would be really cool with Labs is if we could have like really curated like hand validated Parts lists for people where we you know Lucas goes through and tests
200 power supplies and it's like like yeah these 10 are great by the way we hand validated these two so that you've got like an AB option when you're shopping in case this one's out of stock or this one's on a like a bad deal right now or whatever the case may be I I think that would be really cool what's long that's Pie in the Sky Pie in the   sorry say hi to electroboom he's in the hey what's up medy and his computer's even powerful enough to process the chat now did you see that video oh yeah that
that thing was not a good-look computer that goo that was coming out of his screen mhm that's not fake that was not goo that he got on his screen it was coming from the screen that was oozing out of his screen what even could that be I don't know because the screen worked Essence sko I don't I don't know I have no explanation for it but it was nearly impossible to clean from my hands I probably poisoned myself from touching that goo oh do we have frame view was the Liquid Crystal H
Xbox that's okay I have it memorized just uh if you don't mind looking away Andy I'll just take a second oh my God I can't type on this keyboard oh W actually a problem oh wow the o just randomly activated when I pressed shift at I I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it this thing is  e-w wow uh Dan do you have any more merch messages or anything else from the chat that you've been having a look at not really I mean somebody asked if there was ever going to be a music
production PC uh what else a lot of people have been talking about some other things too uh it's the Liquid Crystal part of the LCD I don't know okay Microsoft might defeat me here I don't know if you guys watched that short circuit recently where we ended up in a signin Loop where it would say we'd say sign in with a different account and it would bring us right back to the same account we'd say sign in with a different account it would bring us oh so if you sign in and when it does this
again you just like alt f4 then maybe it'll work the second time it's okay I I got it oh it worked the code this best practices if I'm going to preach it I have to live it but I hate it so much oh uh tbug on Twitch I'm sorry I was reading there yeah I know right our Dell e4750 laptops atw do the same thing with the leaking goo okay mine hasn't started leaking goo what is is the goo I'm scared of this now I didn't know there was goo in our Electronics that's gross pull it
out I know that they're made of Magic Smoke like that's how they function but otherwise is it Liquid Smoke liquid smoke that sounds kind of nice that seems that seems like a possibility I want brisket all right got my bronze ranking let's go I have no idea what my actual MMR is but I've got my bronze rank all right what else you guys got here microplastic jelly PV and LCD jelly I love it I would not lick that jelly there's  way isn't the G and GPU for goo and he wants the computer closer oh
yeah sure so you can see that on the screen at the same time yeah absolutely  pretty man if there's one thing I could change about Halo infinite it would be the time between deciding H I'd like to play some Halo infinite and actually firing a weapon the Lo the initial loading for this okay so first you have to sign into to your Microsoft nonsense if it's been a little while which happens to me sometimes I don't have a ton of time for gaming then you've got "to wait 1,000 metric years for that"
loading bar which is like I I don't I don't know what exactly is it is it doing is it is it processing shaders every bloody time I launched I I don't know then you have to go through like you guys probably saw that there was four or five screens of some stupid item or skin or season I don't care about any of that that you have to get rid of then you've got to wait around for the queue then you've got to wait around for all the other players to load because you're a baller and you have an SSD and a fast
computer then you've got to wait around for it to cinematically show you the map I don't know because sure I guess this is going to help me find my way around then you've got to wait around for every jackass on your team to flex the Skins they spent way too much on and try to make you jealous or something so you'll spend more stupid money then you finally get to play the game also this is taking way longer than it normally does so uh I think it's I think it's borked me and my friends have not played
this in like a year because the last time the last three times that we tried to we just couldn't get into a game oh yeah don't don't forget the struggle of actually managing to get into the same fire team with your friends yeah and so then we just like decide we're never going to play it again we were like we can just go to the Master Chief Collection or just like any other game that's not this yep but hey you have to see you know everyone's chatted out skins or whatever
you know I didn't properly appreciate this bamboo Mouse until we did that video recently with some other like crappy commodity mice and I've discovered just how usable it is uh something that I kind of took for  who I missed that was some terrible shooting I got a response here from medy on YouTube chat the goo on my computer was touchscreen related maybe it is there to absorb shock anyway I'm walking on my treadmill watching on my new  soart all right lus is thinking too much
yeah sorry I was listening to Dan talk while I was trying to kill a guy um and like I mean yeah sure listening to Dan talk makes me want to kill a guy but like doesn't make me good at it no no I'm kidding I'm kidding Dan I love it I we can get some more practice I I love your I love your stuff that you do when you talk anyway the point is we did a video recently on oh got distracted we did a we did a video recently on these peripherals that we bought at the Canadian equivalent of Harbor Freight so
if you're not American um Harbor Freight is where you would go to buy a $4 wrench all right just to give you just to give you some idea of what we were dealing with here uh so it's a store called oh I love this gun uh it a store called Princess Auto and what Drew our eye to them was how much they looked like razor peripherals no no get come on all right cool no takes a really long time to reload okay that was terrible anyway the point is they were absolutely unusable you move the mouse any faster than this
and they would completely lose tracking like actually stop moving on the screen whereas this uh this wooden Mouse from product name bamboo Mouse brand unknown actually usable I kind of don't mind it I mean it's it's not great it's not the best mouse ever or anything but  usable a it's trying to go in for melee kill and all four of them were there was a pretty ill ill-advised plan just like it was an ill-advised plan to try and do this build on stream good job everyone Although our CPU was at like 55 degrees
in that game pretty sick and we forgot to open Hardware info so the GPU was something but probably fine all right do you want to shoot a shout out mxc build again yeah made the case yeah looks right sick yeah go follow me on Instagram or the YouTubes or for the Etsy you can get the plans for this exact case yeah and then you could make it yourself yeah yeah for 1392 Canadian yeah that's like 10 bucks us oh we should also shout out xplit again we'll have a link to them in the
video description you can get 69% off great tools for broadcasting and screen sharing background removal all kinds of good stuff bye
