everyone talks about how great AMD CPUs are but according to the steam Hardware survey Intel is still the one holding the bulk of the ground in the CPU War but if you talk to any Enthusiast they'll gush on and on about how much they love AMD CPUs so just what in the ever Goblin parting is everyone actually buying on Amazon right now oh it is AMD it's all AMD with even two generation old ryzen chips pitching in to kick Intel completely out of the top 10 list and 3D vcash taking every spot on the
podium which wait speaking of two generation old chips now am4 is on top again with all the holiday sales going on right now the only constant is Intel's complete absence at the top of the sales charts with only their older generation selling at all meaning that the steam Hardware survey is based on anci sales and things are shifting Big Time yikes so let's break down the chips y'all are buying and talk about why and talk about our sponsor MSI their newest addition to the Aegis rs2 AI series of
pre-built PCS is here and packed full of the latest and greatest for all your AAA gaming needs unpack your own ready too  when we first sat down to look at CPU sales Trends the 9800 x3d was comfortably in first place thanks to the Feeding Frenzy that took place after what was arguably the most exciting gaming CPU launch in the last 2 and 1/2 years but now it's completely out of stock and it's being scalped hard even on non-auction sites like Amazon making matters worse the word on the street is
that a significant restock of this thing isn't expected until January so for anyone who was hoping to put the atomic number 14 under the Christmas tree this year that ain't going to cut it so how's option two looking here actually not too bad after all the 7800 x3d was in first place for quite a while before the new hotness came along and it's pretty similar to the new one both of them feature eight full fat cores and 16 threads 96 MB of level three cache it's just that the newer 9800 X3 runs faster
in its base and boost clocks and has some generational IPC uplift thanks to Zen 5 processing it is also overclockable but let's be real it's not like the old hat was so slow that you needed to overclock It Anyway the 7800 x3d is not just pretty fast though it is straight up the best rated item that we have ever featured in this series with an absolutely unbelievable 4.9 Stars sure that is based on fewer ratings than the Beloved 3600 non X that we featured last time around but it's also got a lot
more competition from other gaming chips like the 5700 x3d which is here in third spot we'll talk about that later though because right now I want to know what a one-star review even looks like when it only makes up about 2% of the overall reviews let's see Billy had memory controller issues that's no good Ben hated Amazon's customer service a few people had their chips die pun intended anywhere from a few weeks to a few months after purchase there's the odd product missing scam and then multiple
others were upset that they didn't get a Jedi Survivor or avatar game code along with their product so wow even the people who were pissed about this thing were mostly pretty happy with the actual processor as for the overwhelmingly good reviews it's basically an endlessly scrolling page of titles like amazing CPU best gaming CPU on the market and huge upgrade our own review when it came out boiled down to yeah it's the best gaming CPU on the market it's just that it's kind of expensive and unfortunately
it still is even though it's been replaced in amd's product lineup see here's the thing most of the time when the new generation comes out the last generation goes on sale but the 7800 x3d is still selling for $480 about $30 over MSRP which has AMD kind of looking like that smug Facebook Market Marketplace seller saying no low balls I know what I've got and the unfortunate part is AMD is not wrong when we tested the 9800 X 3D more recently it clearly beat its predecessor
which has contributed to its gangbuster sales but the thing is it didn't beat it by as much as some people hoped at least outside of extreme examples like rocket league and Stellaris and the reality is unless you are competitively gaming at 1080P and you need a chip that does well enough and productivity there are other cheaper options remember that 5700x 3D that I mentioned earlier it goes for as little as $200 that is less than half of what you'll pay for an am5 x3d chip I mean
sure am4 is a dead platform but it's also a significantly cheaper platform especially if you're willing to pick up some used parts like a motherboard and ddr4 memory in fact you could build most of your new to you PC for about the price of just one of our best-selling chips which frees up more of your budget for what really matters for a gaming PC the GPU as we saw during our review of the 9800 x3d even with the fastest GPU on the market for now anyway once you go past 1080p the bottleneck swings hard
toward the GPU and the affordability of good 1440p gaming monitors and 4K 120 HZ TVs has never been better so if you want a great gaming experience today day without wasting a dollar am4 plus a better display is kind of still my go-to but if you want to be able to upgrade your system without doing a complete rebuild entrylevel am5 has some standout deals right now as well with a ryzen 7 7700x going for just $267 at the time of filming that's still an 8 core 16 thread processor but at
only a little over half the price of the 7800 X3 D you are going to give up some gaming performance even at higher resolutions and settings but assuming "let's say 1,000 budget that gives you" over $200 extra to throw at your GPU or spend on a nicer monitor or hey maybe a desk upgrade like this Northern Lights desk pad from LTD store.com now so far most of this wasn't much of a surprise lots of people want the best of the best and for everyone else bang for the buck chips well those are a great choice too
but something that did surprise me was just how different the sales mix looks between amd's X CPUs and they're more budget friendly non-x CPUs as I mentioned before the last time we did this the chip we featured was the ryzen 5 3600 to date that has over "43,000 ratings while the 3600 x has" "barely over 12,000 to be clear 12,000" ratings that's a lot they were both great chips but AMD had a big problem when it came to selling the X it was $50 more for a performance difference that
ended up being mostly theoretical Now intel solved this problem within their lineup by artificially limiting overclocking and boost speeds on their nonk CPUs but AMD at least at the time took a more consumer friendly approach and left their entire lineup unlocked well seems like AMD may have learned learned a lesson from all of that because now a few Generations later non-x versions just aren't available alongside their x-r Partners at launch instead AMD launches the beefy version
with full Fanfare then quietly releases the exess variant later how much later well seems like that depends when am5 debuted eager customers were stuck waiting months if they wanted to save a "buck on a slightly slower 7,000 series" "and as for 9,000" it'll be December by the time this video goes live and we haven't seen so much as a rumored release date for non-x 9000 variants I guess that's what happens when the closest thing to a competing product from Intel is a CPU that used to
