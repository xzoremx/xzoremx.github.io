dang nice legs Sebastian thank you I grew them myself no no the're custom "table legs it's AMD ultimate $5,000 Tech" upgrade time and this time it's going to be engineering whiz kid Sebastian from Creator Warehouse he has worked on all kinds of sensible products like our new Precision screwdriver which is why today's theme is sensibility nice new ryzen laptop sensible 3D printer very very sensible but then again Sebastian is also responsible for making this resin infused natural wood and Polished
brass screwdriver that never saw the light of day because it would cost $300 it's pretty things might go a little off the rails  hey Gamers we're back with another AMD ultimate Tech upgrade which means of course another huge AMD giveaway this time you have a chance to win the Ultimate Upgrade gaming bundle which includes an Rog Lix a ryzen 79700 x CPU and Asus R stck motherboard and 32 gigs of lightning fast ddr5 memory enter right now by clicking the link in the description thanks again to AMD for
being a great partner and keeping this series and the giveaways going strong I got to say normally the first thing I do is run around and look for stolen goods from the office but instead I'd like to appreciate the decor thanks this place is so tasteful and alive I don't think there's anyone else on staff who has this many plants that aren't dead I just killed a bunch of recently but you don't see them anymore right no one will know seriously though who else could have all
their pots out on a shelf like this and still have it look tasteful this uh peg board I made a few months ago at the shop I love the art did you paint these yourself we did I used to have glasses well I thought that one was you but oh thanks this table is great is this another project it is I poured the epoxy in the bathroom and who but Sebastian could have a chest High tool drawer in his living room and still have it not look out of place it's also got other stuff like pens some camera gear LTT
store.com I noticed you have other screwdrivers too I actually just got rid a bunch of them are you cheating on the LTT scw driver room just a bit Ah unfortunately this drawer was also a bit incriminating I made those myself at work after work with work equipment yeah this was a proposed uh bit storage solution that it just doesn't Okay it holds them pretty well but it didn't feel enough to be a product I'll admit they were planted that was like planted for me to find something stolen no I want them to be
revived we'll talk about this later how did you end up with our new cables product testing product testing I was actually seeing how flexible it is connected to a controller okay so that is a concern one of the things that we did to make our cables really stand out from the competition you see how thick this is every single conductor has its own shielding so it's a coaxial style cable and this is for the maximum in Signal integrity and charging rate this is a 20 GB per second 240 W capable cable but
because we use like a super nice silicone outer sheathing it's still really flexible so far so good no complaints that is so Co I didn't take it but it's awesome this Red Bull is probably from the office that's mine oh that's yours Reese that is from the office now this isn't from the office but it's much more interesting what on Earth is this these are actually from the office because my kitchen table can store away having the chairs out in the  dude just like that you do know we live
in an earthquake zone though right they should be fine speaking of your hideaway table you designed this right do you want to show it to us yeah we're going to put it together oh cool oh it's part of the upgrade yep which table is which I see two sets of legs so there's three three sets where the devil are you going to put another three tables so the Ikea legs they're gone they were just the temporary legs for the kitchen table as the legs were not done yet these legs are the desk that is getting switched
off of Ikea legs okay to these ones that I made you made this that is so cool yeah so we used oxia sunlan torch to heat up the 3/4 in steel bar then you just take your hands and you just bend it and then instead of having to do all the bends at once I well did each Bend individually and then welded it back together I can't believe how store  the desk is going to go onto these legs and we're going to Cable manage this Abomination over there oh and it'll actually be the right height for you now
because this is small even for me what the heck is going on with this also it's very temporary and it's been temporary for 5 years ah yes temporary the most permanent form of Airy considering how well fought out basically everything else in here is I'm disappointed it's not even attached it's just resting on it you'll see tell you what while you and David swap out the legs on that why don't I have a look at the PC upgrade sounds good before we do that we should probably assemble the kitchen table so
we actually have place to work right wait a second subastian this is also an unfinished project it's more stable but it looks even worse than yours yeah this is just plywood yeah it's going to look pretty at one point see we've discovered the double-edged sword of being a person who likes elegant tasteful Solutions it takes a long time to implement them and everything that's not implemented is uh well you don't have time for exactly it gets functional and then you don't touch
the project for a few years and then you finish it the things Sebastian takes from the office are less tangible but that's a lot of machine time there's more things too yeah I bet I bet there are this one's fun oh that's okay how much machine time is this couple hours each but it's tough to calculate because a lot of the cost of machine time is the cost of the operator especially an experienced operator is worth a lot if you hire them out on a contract basis it's also hard when
because a lot of the cost is also when you're running the machine 100% of the time which we aren't that sounds like a rationalization oh my God this was even jankier than I thought oh yeah it's 100% just double-sided tape on Ikea legs oh oh the came apart before the tape this is why I'm replacing them I guess we'll need a screwdriver to put all of this together now I could use a regular screwdriver or I could use the wooden metal one but what I'd like to use is this because you guys have some
explaining to do about this whole situation they commissioned the creation of a 4X scale Precision multi-bit screwdriver that is so big it holds Precision multi-bit screwdrivers in the storage cap they never told me how much it cost oh what's your guess each we have three of them we made three it was cheaper to get three no I bet it wasn't per unit yes we didn't think it was going to be approved who approved it I don't know someone above Kyle okay well that means it's more than $500 yep I'm going to say
"$1,200 go up a bit sh$ 1,500 a little" "bit more 2,000 yeah pretty much each" each yeah we were shocked it got approved why marketing what do you mean marketing the other big screwdriver sold  three of those is more than the upgrade yeah I will say it's satisfying for this yeah there's kind of specific steps you have to do it or it won't go together nice these go like that okay I help y wash your hands it makes some noise but then the bolts we're going to put bolts in here and here and
we have to attach these before we attach this Frame to this or else you can't put the bolts in got it okay so you invented a folding saw horse leg yeah basically you know those gray tables that are really ugly at events yeah I wanted one of those but that  prettier next up we've got the custom Hardware that just about delayed the shoot today yeah I forgot them at my desk it does look beautiful oh wait Sebastian could you turn off those lights over there for me please hey that's faster it really is isn't it
it really is I I assume that the top end kind of goes on the outside so there's two different sizes who do you think you are Apple I know so those ones go in the bigger hole Yeah and the other one goes on the other side beautiful do you have a mallet we need to uh need to pinch it down a little more I don't actually have a mallet but I do have this it's the next best thing that is I hate that so much this really is gorgeous you guys are getting pretty good with the tormach
at this point aren't you yeah we're kind of at the point  we're we're at the point where the machine's probably holding us back almost it's kind of at that point that's two pitches trying to bring bring this product back and trying to get better Machinery I thought I was here for an AMD ultimate Tech upgrade we haven't even talked about AMD yet why don't you show me what we're supposed to be doing oh my god that's way heavier than it looks what the oh oh that's so cool yeah
so it's thicker in the middle what to just give it more rigidity and more it was just kind of for fun I wanted to make make it thicker and have a long chaer dude it looks so stylish yeah the thing that we're going to do right now is these grooves oh I love it so these go like that and then the Arches just snap on it's also so stable compared to everything before you could St like you  great yep we can just wipe it off uh Sebastian are you expecting the holes to line up with the recepticles this is
a spring pretty much right now yeah you just you stretch it and yeah and it goes in the other thing too is the legs after they were welded they're not all square so the holes in the desktop are all square and lined up yeah and it basically pulls everything into position got it wait a second why do you get that and I get this I did actually bring mine today I should go get my screwdrivers speaking of dude this is so cool I made this yesterday actually I freaking love it yeah it's $30 for a Precision
screwdriver without the bits but this should give you some idea of why it's actually a shockingly complex piece of  engineering she a little heavy yeah yeah it's sturdy okay okay now you said I could jump on it no before we can get the p we're going to have to flip this table off of them though which I think it is ready to go right pretty much we just have to put these in oh what are those doing they make it actually stable oh nice this 3D printed pin holds your whole table up so
these 3D printed Parts I'm going to make out of metal at some point key word being at some point I couldn't help noticing one of your Corners is uh cut yes uh I screwed up when I was making it but we've got an accident piece to fix it oh let's see oh oh that looks sick and a brass screw that looks like you meant to do that I know it's the sherro approach it fits with the AMD upgrade it's like the little gold corner on a CPUs hey oh yeah speaking of which we're finally going to take a look at that
computer now that I can put it on this desk are you sure you don't want to cover the surface of this oh yes I know what you're saying he's picking up what I'm throwing down all right what all am I upgrading on there exactly I see some PTM 7950 thermal P ad I see a 5800 X 3D processor oh 2 TB SSD the main upgrade is the framework laptop the desktop was already pretty good just need a new CPU and that's kind of the beauty of it if you don't want to upgrade to an am5 platform get new ddr5 memory get a new
motherboard you're running what was it "3,000 series yep" 3600 5800 X 3D that's going to be a huge upgrade well I mean depending on the kinds of games you play what are you going to be playing lately I've been playing a bunch of satisfactory okay well that's ensive in certain ways 3D vcash anyone now David said that there was going to be a bit of a challenge in today's video he wants one of us to tackle the desktop upgrade so CPU swap thermal paste and an SSD and one of us
to build a framework laptop tell you what I'm a sporting man which one would you like I want to do the framework but I've never really looked at how you put them together this is going to be challenging then for you it might be three two one go okay here we go now I already know the answer to this but if we don't address it on camera I'm sure that AMD won't be super thrilled about it so I'm going to ask you which version of the framework laptop did you get this is the AMD version oh good do you happen
to remember which CPU it is 7840 U you can actually play even semi-recent AAA games at 720P 1080p like it's going to be about like a steam deck or a first generation Ally but it's got a 2.8k screen yeah the oh dude the new screen is so nice new screen I would love to have a touchscreen framework dude every time I see narv I bog him about it I do have to say though this is a nicely built little machine I think you're one of the first people who's done one of these upgrades whose system is not disgusting
I'm looking at you David I think I've got enough hair to make another dog I was looking at his thermal paste spread here it took me a second you're using the offset Mount I didn't think that was a thing back when ryzen 3000 came out it wasn't I don't think okay I put this fairly recently probably the last 6 months for those of you wondering why you would want your cooler mounted slightly offset on your CPU many modern AMD chips don't have the compute dieses in the center they're
actually a little bit lower so by Cent entering the heat sink on the dyes rather than on the heat spreader which here you go you can see what that ends up looking like on here you can end up cooling them more effectively how are things going for you Sebastian I have put the SSD in Nice in goes the ryzen 5800 X3 that is a really nice little upgrade it is amazing how long AMD supported this am4 platform and the substantial upgrades that people who invested in it can now put into their
machines investment disclosure I'm invested in framework I think it's super cool that you can take apart and put together their whole machine with just the one two bit screwdriver that they include but on the other hand he's also invested in LTD store.com yeah it is a bit of a pain in the butt to apply but once you get it on it performs really well the trick to winning the race is when lonus does both things both things oh well oh cool you went with the clear bezel I saw that it existed we sent them
a message and they sent one over Dude I love the clear bezel yeah the clear  now I couldn't help noticing you boot it up into Windows you probably think that you won right maybe well I couldn't help noticing that your machine doesn't have any IO yet uh no it does not this race ain't over boys let's see how quickly Seb can open up for Io modules and plug in four USB C's and how quickly lonus can install a GPU anyway there's your upgraded machine Let's Go boys you said it was still boot
though right yeah I was still boot no look mine's starting up you don't even have a monitor on the desk right now this is so cute yeah I have an X1 P1 something and it's so bulky this is like so compact I haven't actually owned a 3D printer even though I've been working with them for like 15 years that surprises me a lot yeah but I've just never really needed to have one at home okay so why the A1 it was cheap it was on sale this was 200 US is it doing something right now likeing calibration oh okay
basically it goes and vibrates and figures out what stuff to ignore yeah it's super cool one of the reasons the bamboos can go so fast is they'll like rip around and then they'll like cancel out the vibration of the surface they're sitting on just like oh yeah and bamboo has cool little accessories that is super cool I bought the illuminated like photo frame one oh did you see that one no yeah so you uh it's like a it's like a little um diffused like backlight thing oh and
then you print a scene yeah and then they've got ones for like little lamps what's the first thing you're going to print uh probably just the the little boat the Beni it's green it's pooping he's pooping I made a little poop I'm a watching you poop sick all right oh it sings Let's go do your peripherals okay now these speakers are old yep no need to replace them audio engine 2os chairs new and the UPS is new guys high five for responsibility if you like to not lose your work you should
have an uninterruptible power supply at your workstation and even just to take better care of your components we have noticed that we've experienced better stability with computers especially if they have crappy input power when we use an uninterruptible power supply that Smooths out the incoming voltage which is important at the office because our power is terrible I do know this scrapyard Warriors I think either number two or three Austin Evans had an overclock that worked just fine on one
circuit and was unstable on another circuit plugged in in our office now I couldn't help noticing that for someone who I don't know doesn't play that many games these days you picked up a 34 in600 38 good gravy that thing is huge to be fair it's also our TV okay that makes sense sensible tasteful chair too why' you choose this I like the color and again sensible so you spend a lot of money for an office chair but it is "comfy how much is a lot of money 1,000" us this is "$1,000 Herman Miller I guess that's"
amd's problem yeah dude this thing's ripping so hard it's actually moving around on the island very similar yeah that one doesn't have hot glue on it though seeing double oh my God so the new ones you got the wireless hyperx whatevers what are these cloud something Cloud something Cloud 3 Cloud 2 this is going to be a nice little upgrade over that old zoi which respectable Mouse but is it Wireless it's not wireless does it have a "4,000 Hertz pulling rate dongle does not"
did you really feel this was necessary not particularly oh okay cuz it does a thousand Herz out of the box anyway I think so I don't know the exact specs but yeah something like that okay uh wait I don't see a keyboard keyboard is not getting replaced I made this why would you before be careful it kind of opens up it's a custom build very cool I love the look yeah that is a gorgeous piece of wood you've got yourself there goes well with your nice legs it's the combo it is amazing what
you can print for a couple hundred bucks these days what all are we changing we are taking the monitor that was over there all right putting it here so this one's out it's going it's I was just kidding I'm not going to throw it on the ground and then other than that new keyboard the Lenovo doc oh okay so basically we're setting it up so that you just have one USBC into the laptop and you're done that's it and this is Heather's desk yeah so uh why didn't she get legs those are coming are they yes when next 5
years well there nothing if not honest now tell me this I you know I don't tell people internally to like buy Frameworks I don't push for us to use them for our laptops they there's good things about them but there's also more challenging things about them which Austin Evans point out recently in his video they are not super price competitive what made you decide on a framework cuz you could have gotten any laptop there was a few things there definitely positives and negatives I like that in 5 years you can
swap out the main board and you can use the old main board to do like a little server or something like that I think that's super cool framework hasn't committed 5 years of support for this chassis but but sure maybe sure even two three years whatever it is the fact that you can customize your IO I think is really big because a lot of laptops now come with like one USBC or yeah two all right so you went with SD usba USBC and HDMI yeah and I've got some more USB C's now Heather's new keyboard looks amazing
this is gorgeous my keyboard at work is same type but black and they're really pretty I couldn't help noticing that in addition though to not upgrading Heather's desk you did a very very how you say piss poor job of the cable management some effort was made you manag to tie these bricks to one of our magnetic Cable Management holders but there's absolutely nothing to stick it to and it's all just there used to be some metal plates beside the desk there used to be there used to be okay so are we going to at
least like yes we W make it pretty okay we should do that I was about to say see this is why you need a desk Pad but like if I put this much work into building beautiful desk I probably wouldn't want to cover the whole thing up either yeah dude I love the vibe here wait why is this part of the decor are you keeping this it's a bunch of uh defective precisions oops mister I like don't like game that much 100% complete Elden ring okay hey sure I like the games I like Elden ring Hades you said you didn't play
intensive to the computer to the computer Elden Ring's pretty demanding it's yeah okay I mean yeah sure I guess um fine oh yeah and we didn't even show the finished Cable Management dude this is awesome this is ree's Cable Management we'll see David's in a bit Yeah Reese's is probably better than David's don't look too close do you notice a difference in performance right the second no okay but we'll see oh I guess it depends on how large of a factory you so exact how big of a factory is this
moderate okay do you have a bigger one I have not gotten that far yet you just do very simple things of you take iron make a like iron Rod sure wait how is this the game you're just doing what you do for work it's different I couldn't help noticing do you play tape to tape I do really yes a man of culture I think you might have started like a lot of people playing tape to tape oh really it's so good it's really good maybe we'll do lonus versus Sebastian tape to tape as as a float plane exclusive lm. g/ flat
plane we can decide once and for all who gets to use the name Sebastian I was going to say it's a Sebastian versus Sebastian the dongers did you create this team yep let's go oh dang it let's go let's go let's go right in front a let's go paner nickel what what okay but before we go check out the laptop setup there's a reveal yes the most sensible purchase of the whole time okay I'm not familiar with this brand you probably wouldn't be metmo okay so it's a cube right I mean 
but it's a fidget toy you can pull it fully out I'm going to say that this is 300 bucks that's very close nice it's 400 you could get this or you could get the 3D printer already on tape to tape nice one USB set nice freaking awesome and she has a reasonable size monitor now yeah not as big as yours no that's been a common theme in these upgrades everyone gets the nicest thing for themselves and then Theo gets the like I don't know hand me down I got legs for my desk she doesn't have legs yet I mean
she got a new mouse too no she already had it oh so she already had a better Mouse than you yes can you explain this chair to me I would like you to see you try first no what come on close come on am I close not is it's supposed to be on your knees on your knees wait what like this it's actually so comfy o I don't know guys well the good thing is that Sebastian's happy and I love this setup the amount of care and attention that went into your setup and then Heather also got a setup upgrade
and David cable managed this so if you want to see underneath wo wo wo W wo whoo wo W it was not to be seen dude and I even forgot about the new dining room table I freaking love the space savings here in spite of all the money he wasted I think Sebastian still managed to have one of the more minimalist and practical setups and that's with $400 on a metal "cube and $11,000 on a Herman Miller" chair yeah sensible just like this sensible Sho for our sponsor AMD without "whom we couldn't do the $5,000 Tech"
upgrade series and really get to know the truly fascinating group of people that we have working at lus Media Group and Creator warehouse and Flo plane and all those companies that I work for too if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out sherrod's which was the polar opposite not very sensible at all
