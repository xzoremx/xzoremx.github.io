this CPU is ancient technology by today's standards one measley corpe clocked at just 1.8 GHz but when I was in grade n this Pentium 4 processor was crowned The Benchmark Destroyer by Maximum PC Magazine it ran Quake 3 at a blistering 226 frames per second that is 18% faster than the very best that AMD could muster at the time though it would have cost you an extra $450 today dollar for the privilege now at that point in my life my only source of income was the shiny Looney that my
parents would give me for each wheelbarrow of manure that I hauled to the Garden so to say that this would have been Out Of Reach for me would be a gross understatement and even if I could afford the CPU there is no way that I would have been able to obtain The Supporting Cast starting with this premium Asus p 4T motherboard with both software and Hardware overclocking controls one day I told myself one day the price of all of this will come down and I will build a dream machine of my
very own well guess what folks it's ones day and the pile around me might not look it but in September of 2001 this was maximum PC's dream gaming machine build dream being an excellent choice of  "$5,700 that is almost three Vision Pros" in today's money it was a lot cheaper today but eBay fees are still a trip and I could use some help paying for all this from our sponsor Ridge it's almost Father's Day and ridge is here to help you be the favorite Child get something nice for your dad at their father's day
sale with some items up to 40% off check it out using the link in the description now I showed you guys the CPU and motherboard but what about our eyew watering 256 megabytes of 800 megat transfer per second Rd Ram from Samsung that's right it wasn't always DDR and rambus memory was chosen for this build because of its smarter bandwidth utilization compared to DDR in hindsight it was a not a great standard it ran hot it was power hungry and generally performed worse per dollar
and went out of Style just around the time this build was spec but hey sucks to BS I guess like modern DDR memory controllers you could run Rd Ram in dual channel for increased bandwidth but it was just Dumber that is to say that if you only had two sticks you had to install these dummy modules in the empty ones in order for it to operate properly it was a pretty good system here's a bizarre one at this stage in the game aftermarket CPU cooling was more of an afterthought with Maximum PC opting for
the Box cooler from Intel which isn't to say that PC cooling didn't matter it was just more about case selection this is in my humble opinion one of the big highlights of this build The Cooler Master ATC 20101 we had to reach out to fellow YouTuber retro machines who made a video covering this case 10 years ago in order to get our hands on one that is how rare these things have become thank goodness he's still head is kicking around it supports up to 10 drives including four internal hard drives it's
got support for four fans two in the front one in the back one in the top and it's even got two front USB ports which guys was not a given back then okay of course none of that is what's turned it into an absolutely Timeless piece of gaming history that is the aesthetic snake oil marketing about convective cooling aside as Maximum PC put it nothing says Swank better than brushed aluminum and that is so brushing true also can we take a moment to appreciate this build quality damn they don't build
them like that anymore speaking of ludicrous overbuild here's a cool feature that we used to see on high-end cases removable motherboard trays and the idea was that oh yeah you can you know build the whole platform outside of the case and then slide the whole thing in when you're good to go so convenient now all I need to do is slide this into the case do most of the build and cable tie everything into place effectively locking the motherboard in guess you can see why these didn't
last archaic odity is aside though it's fascinating to see how little the ATX standard has actually changed aside from maybe making some extra room for a power supply and adding some speed holes for more cooling you could absolutely build modern system in this thing of course that isn't the exercise today it's been a while since I've installed spinning rust as a boot Drive in a gaming PC but today we've got not one but two identical IBM deskstar 60g XP hard drives at least that's what we ordered
then one of them showed up as um not one of those which is kind of an issue since Maximum PC calls for a very fast stripe raid zero boot config except that they didn't know that desk Stars especially the 75 GXP family would earn the nickname death stars for their exceptionally High failure rates and would contribute to IBM divesting of its entire hard drive business to Hitachi just one year after the publication of this issue so from my point of view we should just appreciate the one in a
million shot that one of these showed up in working order run the system off that and then our promised FastTrack 100 tx2 raid card can just be for decoration now as Maximum PC put it rounded IDE cables provide no better performance but they elicit ooze and Oz whenever we show off the machine and they felt this was well worth their Hefty price tag now this one's a little bit more ooh and but hey at least we also have some black wi Loom to cover it up speaking of cable management you guys should check
out our sick new cable management arches at LTT store.com just keep the more powerful magnets away from your hard drives now we just got to figure out how to get the games onto the hard drive it sure isn't going to be with the network port on our motherboard don't worry guys we are going to add a network card but that isn't going to be how we install games for that we're going to need the TDK Voss CD you show me better branding and I will show you a liar that is hilarious it offers up 24x right speeds
10x rewrites 40x read speeds and they claimed burst reads of up to 16.6 megabytes per second which hilariously is just about the average worldwide broadband internet speed today so good job TDK and it had even more going for it one of its killer features was its proprietary burn prooof technology which allowed you you to safely write or burn a disc while using your PC for other applications without worrying about buffer underrun errors with other drives doing so much as interacting with your
computer at all depending on the overall speed of your system would often lead to shiny but useless coasters back then by the way it was also common to have a secondary optical drive to make the creation of backup media easier you could burn straight from disc to dis or so you could just leave your favorite game installed on the drive while you created an MP3 mix CD so that's why we also threw in this tashiba SDM 1217 DVD drive rounding out our Drive selections the most exciting thing I can say about
this Samsung floppy disc drive is that it's silver and sort of matches the color of her case thankfully things get a little more electric when we move on to power we've got the PC power and cooling silencer 420 which okay is not not quite the same as the 400 watt unit that the magazine suggests but come on guys finding exact part number matches for E-Waste from 23 years ago is hard and this one is definitely nicer in any case this line of seic manufactured units had a good
reputation for both reliability and for quiet operation I got to say it's kind of wild to me that 420 Watts was enough to power an entire topend gaming machine when we've got consumer CPUs that will draw  alone yeah I guess this is the part in the build where we give up on the cable management and take a leaf out of Maximum PC's book yes split Loom wire covers they were awful then and they're awful now on the subject of things with very different power requirements today it's finally time for the pesta
resistance this Asus Nvidia v8200 Deluxe a GeForce 3 card with an AGP 4X interface 64 megabytes that's right 64 million bytes of video memory and a rated 200 MHz clock speed that by the way this variant juices all the way to 270 mahz as if you guys weren't drooling already it has four pixel shaders one vertex Shader support for Direct X 8.1 and openg which brings us to all the other fun cards we get to install I already talked about our IDE raid card but we've got two more devices our
3om 100 megabit per second network card and O this one's cool our Hercules game theater XP which we're going to dive into a little bit more as we set up our audio first we need to see if this thing even works oh that's a good sign oh no it's on it's on yeah give it a sec give it a sec it's got this beep is good that means I wired up the speaker correctly let's go hey there we go ooh manual frequency let's overclock no let's not overclock yet let's just make sure we've got the right boot device
selected get this thing fired up we may  card okay I know I know the Death Star recommendation wasn't the only one that wouldn't age well Windows me the last do space Windows is widely considered to be the worst version of Windows ever released largely because it was a reliability nightmare but unfortunately when this system was published in Maximum PC Windows XP had been released to oems but was still about a month away from retail so uh this is what we got oh I guess we can
start talking about peripherals though for our monitor we ended up looking over a few pages to the dream content creation guide and found the Sony fw900 arguably the best consumer CRT ever made this thing is so legendary we made a dedicated video about it and it is one of the only three parts of the setup that are actually worth more today than they were at launch it's around "$3,000 for one in good condition but at" up to 1440 P at 60 HZ and up to 160 HZ at lower resolutions with near perfect
blacks and motion Clarity it's a pretty incredible display even now can I make a comment about this Mouse yeah I hate it was this really their recommendation yeah it vibrates every time you hover over an icon yeah that's awful neet the Logitech I feel why would you point and click when you can feel and click here I'm going to try and get my mic close to this thing can you hear that oh yeah making matters worse it is heavy as all get out which doesn't even appear to be all the
vibration motor it looks like it has a big metal plate in it I guess that was a feature thankfully the keyboard Choice was a little less polarizing this is from kronic lifetime series and it uses kronic designer rubber doome switches supported with springs these um were not favored by keyboard enthusiasts and honestly feels pretty cheap but maybe it was good bang for the buck this is wild they claim it's similar in performance to a toer real force uh you know what it's not that bad
to type on it's mushy though it's not great it's not great what is going to be great is our audio experience starting with the other half of the Hercules game theer XP that I showed you guys before you see the card only has two ports on it an oxen and a db44 connector what goes at the other end of this thick 2 m cable this awesome external module I'm talking analog 5.1 for surround sound speakers every input Under the Sun quarin Jack RCA midi coax and spiff it's got built-in volume controls a game port
for your joystick and did I even mention it's got a four port integ ated USB hub this module makes connecting everything much easier not just our audio sound card or like everything card of course that is what we're going to use it for first though I remember these I had a set of these the clips promedia  tested and they were right long story short I made the mistake of selling mine for a fraction of what I paid for it back in the day which makes the price we paid to replace it so much more painful
that's right my friends this is one more item that regularly goes from about the same today than it did back when it was new and that's even if you can find the all important control pod and subwoofer with bash oh are we crab raving right away yes man I miss my prome ultra 51s oh yeah no no these things were legitimately awesome also are my surrounds my primaries I think it might be I think I might be a little confused by the MP3 encoding yeah but the sub Works David did you check this out no
the center channel has a cute little stick so you can change the height oh on what works best for your angle but can you have it point up uh no hold on you got to stand in The Sweet Spot though you got to come stand in a sweet spot with me hold on you're a little close you're a little close oh yeah is the sub working is it ever with bash technology I would be so happy to have this set up man dude when I was like 16 and I had this I was in heaven what went wrong Maximum PC acknowledges though
that not everyone has a living situation that's conducive to a giant bulky 5.1 setup so that is where these come in now I never really needed headphones living in my mom's basement at the time literally but if it's on the list we got to buy it them's the rules and the Sennheiser HD 580s actually still hold up very well today plasticy Construction compared to newer sennheisers means they don't really feel as premium but it also means they're super light and they have a nice neutral sound profile that makes
some feel that they are worthy of being called endgame headphones oh look at this Andrew they're made in Ireland just like you now I've made one critical error in our configuration for return to Castle Wolfenstein I set it to my desktop resolution of 1600 by 1200 forgetting that yeah in those days it's really more like 800 by6 00 if you want hey or maybe I could just run it at "1,600 by" 1200 damn I guess that's what having a top-of-the-line gaming PC did for you this like unironically works so this
game gets capped at 90 FPS oh oh oh um which I'm surprised we can surprised we're getting anything close to that dude neither I nor anyone I knew had anything like this anything even close to this if I saw this i' like what that's a thing that's possible in 2001 people were gaming like this no man in 2001 like what was I playing Warcraft 2 oh wow ano 1602 what about a racing game though yeah I could get into that kind of busy playing return to Castle Wolfenstein right now but like yeah sure I guess the 
us all right let's talk about something else with force feedback this time it's the Logitech wingman formula Force GP oh man this feels pretty basic compared to a modern high-end racing wheel compared to a modern low-end racing wheel yeah that's true I feel like I'm in 2001 sitting in my dad's lap operating the car okay hold on 2001 no I wouldn't have needed to sit in my dad's lap at that you're like a 16-year-old no no no I was uh no in 2001 I was 13 she still a little old for the
dad's lap yeah here we go driving the Lotus Elise W that oh is this opposite day it looks like you know what I can deal with this I can do this I can do this I got this i got this brother this beautiful like what 25 frames 30 frames a second that's it more than that I guess you know what this is very playable but you're not wrong it's probably in the uh opposite opposite day oh I'm going to take a shortcut shortcut oh points zero points for my shortcut why is it Opposite how dare you tell me
I'm going backwards I will tell you when I'm backwards oh come on copper you're in the way buddy let me race brother is that a missile is it firing things a yep you de I never played this game back in the day look I didn't have a computer that could play this game back in the day it looks not bad totally looks fine I would play this right now but what about this is freaking awesome second peripherals ooh made the Microsoft Sidewinder force feedback 2 now with more force feedback
than ever before not to mention ooh handle twist for immediate Rudder control a redesign trigger man this thing's freaking heavy oh wow and it even has an internal AC to DC power supply this thing actually feels pretty good it's pretty nice I like it wow that like feels pretty good destroy all enemy fighters to win fire the guns oh no way oh wait I have no throttle okay that's going to be a problem come on get over here oh my God that is so cool oh it's so visceral got him see you later Castrol
that'll learn you 70 mil gun look at this buddy see you later oh oh where's his shoot where's his shoot no no he's dead he's dead get over here who who wo can you shoot down his parachute I don't think you can so I think you just changed we got it boys see you later buddy you're a freaking Pro hold on hold on here's his parachute we could also play this game with this controller uh I would suggest against it because that d-pad is something special the worst thing I've ever seen it's off
axis that's terrible Sidewinder Gamepad Pro more like Sidewinder Gamepad no it's the sickest burn that was so good bottom line I might not agree with every single choice that Maximum PC made here but thing is hindsight's 2020 and realistically if you traded your kidney for one of these back in 2001 you'd be feeling pretty darn good about it for a  6 months until something better came out obviously at the pace technology moves it is rarely a good investment but I am blown away by how many of these
components do still hold up reasonably well today and the fact that any of them are still worth more than they were back when Maximum PC configured this thing I'm also blown away by this segue to our sponsor vessie here in Vancouver the weather can be unpredictable but thankfully vessie makes it easy to prepare for unpredictability they claim their shoes are fully waterproof thanks to their di attack technology so even the heaviest of rainfalls don't stand a chance their
