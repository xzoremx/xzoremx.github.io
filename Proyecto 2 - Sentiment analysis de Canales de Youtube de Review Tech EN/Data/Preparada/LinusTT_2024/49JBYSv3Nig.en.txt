longtime viewers will know that I've had my fair share of problems with all of the tech that I've stuffed into my new house but one of the biggest pain points has been the wi-fi at first I thought it might be random interference from dodgy smart home gadgets and then I blamed the devices themselves which would just disconnect and then refuse to reconnect seemingly at random but as it turned out the answer was both more complicated and also simpler than I thought every one of
my access points had defaulted to channel one in the 2.4 GHz band which meant that even though I never configured that I had a traffic jam of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi around my entire house which got me thinking is it possible to have too much Wi-Fi how bad would that be and it's already completely bricked our video streams turns out pretty bad so if you want to improve your Wi-Fi at home the answer is not to put an access point in every room though you know what you could put in every room wa no not
that our sponsor Ridge they're doing a massive sweep Stakes now until September 13th with prizes like a goldplated cyber truck a Hennessy Velociraptor which is "also a truck or $100,000 in cash enter" for free or grab a mystery wallet at ridge.com Linus mystery for just $69 nice as fun as it would be to start here first we need to back up a little we have a full video on this EMC Chamber from Raymond DMC but the tldr is this room blocks radio waves creating an absolutely ideal environment for testing
manufacturer claims so we've got our one access point here configured to 2.4 GHz Channel 1 and we've got our Wi-Fi 7 laptop over there which we'll be using to complete a 10 GB file transfer and go wow that's really impressive but it's still going to take a while so while we wait for that to complete I should probably explain why you would never see these results at home 2.4 GHz has been in use for Wi-Fi since 802.11b hit the market back in 1999 it has some major drawbacks these
days but also a few key advantages that keep it in use namely its Legacy compatibility its Superior maximum range and its very low implementation cost unfortunately it's these very same ah advantages that can turn 2.4 GHz into such a nightmare allow me to demonstrate well I just did I bet those speeds Dro to like half right uh they're all oh now they're going down there they go yep took a second but they're about half now cool right but not scientific let's get the door closed and show you what happened
in a controlled environment I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you probably don't live in an electromagnetic isolation cell so let's try to create a more realworld environment within our cell in our scenario you live in a windowless apartment with neighbors on all six sides and those will be represented by the six access points that we're going to position around the room I'm going to assume that your internet service provider negotiated an exclusivity deal with the builder so all
of your neighbors have the same default router running factory default settings and would you look at that seven Wi-Fi let's do the same file transfer yeah it's not bad oh but it sure as heck isn't 20 megabytes a second no problem you say as long as we aren't all streaming Netflix at the same time it shouldn't be a problem and yet it is it's not the slowest thing ever but it's definitely slower than what we saw last time so what's going on Meet the ypy dbx while you can use a free app on your
phone to see all of the wireless networks around you including which channels they're operating on which goes a long way you need a spectrum analyzer tool like this one to see just how busy the airwaves are these new U7 Pro Max devices also have a built-in antenna just for spectrum analysis meaning that once you install them you can then actually check check where they're conflicting which channels are issues and the waterfall effect just like the Y spy and you can actually see right here
on channel one where all of our access points are loaded up we are looking at anywhere from 35 to 45% utilization and what's really wild is the traffic you're seeing isn't from them doing anything it's just from them looking for devices that might want to connect to them so let's kick things up a notch and play a YouTube video and as expected basically no difference I mean if you couldn't watch a YouTube video when you had six neighbors Wi-Fi wouldn't work at all so this shouldn't
be a surprise but what happens if your neighbors all get home and start streaming video as well I can see the utilization changing wow that's a lot more traffic already yep I don't even have all of them connected yet there you go all six of our neighbors that's a lot spicier basically red equals bad and what's really interesting is that even though our utilization isn't 100% you can see frequent hitches in our phones here oh oh that one's really bad now parseek being a realtime streaming application
rather than loading in chunks like YouTube is a worst case scenario but it's also a real world one so let's see what our file transfer looks like with all of those running at the same time actually that's better than I expected but definitely slower what's even more interesting though is the way that now instead of just this one hitching all the time they're all doing it as they wait around for their turn to transfer data but wait hold on a second lonus what are the phones waiting for each
phone is connected to just one of our six access points they're not sharing the connection with anything else ah but to use a classic networking analogy where data payloads are cars and wireless spectrum is roads you can actually see in the utilization here that because they are all using the factory default configuration they're all sharing the same road this limits the maximum total bandwidth across all of these devices in spite of the fact that they're all connected to different
access points this creates traffic jam situations as the APS and the connected devices fight to decide whose turn it is to go now the obvious solution would be to add more roads for these guys to drive on and they do do that in most cases the 2.4 GHz Spectrum has three nonoverlapping channels but this only helps if everyone works together to avoid using the same channels as each other and even then it only helps to a point While most real Apartments don't have neighbors on every single side
because of 2.4 gz's incredible wall all penetrating power it's still common to see as many as a couple of dozen nearby access points that are clogging up the airwaves and we're about to kick things up another notch to show you why that can be such a problem after we check on that file transfer oh I'm going to make it s oh God I didn't make it it is much slower yeah I don't feel like waiting around for this you're going to get I'll get the actual times of them you'll make graphs and stuff yeah  
it now courtesy of ubiquity instead of six neighbors we're going to have 50 now we didn't have 50 phones to pair of them but as you're about to see just having this many APS in a room together is going to cause some serious problems are these ones here plugged in they're boing up yeah no I I see them flashing and it's already completely bricked our video streams the thing to remember here guys is none of the access points we just put in the room are actually connected to anything but what
about our file transfer Elijah I don't even think you'll get it started but go for it I'm still connected to Wi-Fi which is more than some of my devices could do at home yes they would disconnect and simply not be able to reconnect maybe that's good news then I doubt it it already lagged at the beginning it hasn't even figured out that it's the same file that's right cuz it would ask for the copy replac it hasn't even prompted me if I want to overwrite it oh hold on let's uh let's fire up the Spectrum
analyzer this will still work because it doesn't rely on being connected to Wi-Fi oh we've exceeded their default scale uh which is at minus 80 DB ah here we go I didn't know it went that color of red that is a very very swamped Network and what's really interesting is Elijah go ahead and kill the attempts at Parx streaming here look at this even with all the parex streams dead that utilization is still 100% and most of these don't have any devices connected to them and even the ones that do aren't
transferring anything so what's on the road a lot of things sending out multiple pings a second to check for devices to connect to uh checking for devices it might have lost a connection to or sometimes they're even trying to adjust their settings based on detecting traffic that might be in the air and when you get enough of this background noise traffic this results in an environment where we can't even begin transferring a file so what can we do to fix it we can start by changing the
channel very fun funny now your interface is probably going to look a little bit different but nearly every wireless router or access point has a similar option buried somewhere in the admin control panel allowing you to select another Channel there are a couple of things to watch out for though and the first one is selecting the right one we'd recommend downloading an app such as Wi-Fi man to see which channels are most utilized in your area so that you can select one that is well not
those ones another thing to watch out for is not getting tempted by the in between channels they might look less utilized but because of the way they overlap with channels 1 six and 11 they can end up causing more problems than they solve now I can practically hear you asking lonus why would I do any of this when I can just enable automatic Channel switching and that's a good question sometimes as a set and forget solution it can be great but depending on your device and more importantly your
neighbor's devices they might only scan for access points while they're booting up which can lead to them accidentally ending up stuck on suboptimal overlapping channels while you're in here by the way load balancing between channels is the most important step but a surprisingly effective strategy to help everyone around you out can be to lower the transmit power of your access point if everyone in an apartment complex did this everyone's speed within their unit would probably be the same
but they'd be much less likely to interfere with their neighbors outside of their unit the last big fix is to move any devices that you can off of 2.4 GHz for me this unfortunately wasn't possible since I have a handful of smart devices that only work on 2.4 GHz but for everything else 5 GHz and especially 6 GHz offer multiple benefits which is a huge advantage of Wi-Fi 7 devices like UniFi lineup that we used Wi-Fi 7 capable devices are able to dynamically switch between 65 and 2.4 GHz bands to
adjust for latency or any other factors that may be affecting your connection with some devices even supporting mlo or multi-link operation allowing your client devices to connect using all three bands at the same time which Aggregates their bandwidth together for greater overall performance the only drawback is that compared to 2.4 they don't offer the same range that's why the best installations configure their APS to use a combination let's say you're in a pretty big house or a small
business and you've got an AP right in the middle you need to extend your 5 GHz range to the far reaches of the building so okay you add two more APS but now your 2.4 GHz devices are all talking over each other well no problem most APS allow the 2.4 GHz radio to be turned off so you can have your range and eat your speed too in the real world nailing down all of these optimizations can be challenging though especially if you aren't on the best terms with your neighbors but who knows maybe if you
