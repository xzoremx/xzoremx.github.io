what is up everyone and welcome to the W show I'm coming to you live from the we western side of the Pacific and we've got a great show lined up for you guys today the big story this week is obviously that apple is being sued by the US Department of Justice in other almost equally big news I was featured in a song from smos and it was gone sexual extremely sexual yeah uh LinkedIn thinks gaming at work is cool and your entire company should compete against other companies
which is exciting and also a terrible idea which we'll discuss later and I don't know if you mentioned this or not but Apex Legends it was hacked mid tournament in like a big way that sort of ruined everything we'll talk about that I didn't know that hacking works like that all right let's go ahead and roll that intro I can't do it Luke has to do it oh  uh ja you green and brought by Jawa you okay well we were both doing it so that's great nice absolutely fantastic all right why don't we jump right into
our first topic and if you are if you're a frequenter of R slapple um you're going to have to you're going to have to grab your grab your copium supplements because this is going to be pretty hard to hear but the reason that I am happy about this news is not that I hate Apple in fact uh those of you who were here for the pre-show on float plane and twitch will have seen that I daily Drive airpods I actually use Apple products as part of my life and even even pay a lot of money
for them do you know how you know I pay a lot of money for them because they're made by Apple oh  I uh oh we lost him uh while we hopefully get him back I'm just going to start reading the topic yeah he's back he's back should be cool he's back okay do you want to turn the bandwidth down a little bit actually let's have Luke read the topic I'll be right back sounds good yesterday the US Department of uh of dustice wow that would be cool Department the US Department of Justice
and Attorneys General from more than a dozen states filed a lawsuit against Apple for monopolizing smartphone markets in the doj's most significant antitrust lawsuit since its like amazingly massive case against Microsoft in 1998 in which Microsoft was accused of acting anti-competitive to push Internet Explorer if any of you even remember that on users EP epic games fortnite lawsuit only claimed that apple had a monopoly on the iOS software distribution Market this lawsuit concerns Apple's effects on the
smartphone market at large the whole thing iPhones account for around 56% of the US smartphone market having passed the 50% Mark in 2020 the case in a nutshell the government complaint cites pretty much every complaint about iOS brought up by users in recent memory this includes Apple blocking third-party app stores payment systems and sideloading on iOS intentionally obstructing crossplatform features in apps like apple messages making it seem to iPhone users like Android phones are to blame uh so you
should you know just just buy your mom an iPhone that quote uh a line that the doj quotes specifically in its document you can look up that clip it's it's pretty great um suppressing Cloud streaming services Apple did recently change their Global policies to allow services like Xbox Cloud streaming and GeForce now to host their game streaming library in a single IOS app uh also refusing to add Android support to Apple watch in response Apple told 9 to5 Mac they investigated this possibility for 3
years concluding it wasn't doable because of technical limitations also forcing third part hold on can I can look I'm gon let you finish but can I just call I don't have my bleep button so so I'll have to come up with manually name um oxen manure um on that there is there is absolutely no way that a company the size of apple with Apple's resources could not find any meaningful way to get the Apple watch I don't think that people even would have expected feature parody I mean as an Android User
with airpods I understand that I'm a bit of a second class citizen there are certain things that you know I I I get you know are not necessarily going to work like if apple is using um you know a special proprietary codec or something like that to enable their spatial nonsense it's like okay yeah you know what maybe I don't get that but there are certain thing no this is this is them degrading The Experience because  malici I shouldn't say malicious but because they oh man arrogance the word escapes
me right now but basically because they don't respect me enough for not buying enough of their products to put in the work for me the fact that I can't alter what the long presses of the stems do unless I buy an iPhone and connect it to an iPhone um that's really bad the fact that I cannot update the firmware in in any way without a Bluetooth connection to an  just they just obviously hate their users it's it's yeah it's there you go thank you Lightning Man GTS it's spiteful um there's absolutely no way
that they shouldn't be able to update the firmware some other way they just designed the product in such a way that it just won't work uh and they do it on purpose um a part of me is willing to sort of consider a little bit that everyone at Apple probably just you know enemas the Kool-Aid all day every day and can't even imagine a world where you you just wouldn't have an iPhone um so it's not a problem at all uh so you know why would we have a way for you to you know connect to the case via a wire
and have it you know push that way or something and I understand that the the cas is just for charging or or whatever except that it's not because they can definitely communicate with the airpods via the case so I don't know um so I can understand why they just wouldn't consider it when they're designing the product but it just happens too consistently to the point where it has to be on purpose at this point and I think that's essentially what the doj is getting at is that we've got this long
history of Apple designing their products for minimum interoperability and then basically shrugging and going buy more of our stuff okay Luke sorry go go ahead go ahead yeah no worries uh to to continue the citations uh from the government forcing third-party payment services to use apple wallet blocking super apps like WeChat uh alipay and other apps that also serve as platforms for mini apps and thus reduce the users dependence on Apple's own features and more there's there's tons the do doj even says
carplay is anti-competitive which was actually kind of interesting to me but anyways um uh yeah so that doesn't make sense on the surface but if you click through what they're what they're alluding to is actually a carplay future uh not the state of carplay right now so apple is apparently telling auto manufacturers that in the future if they want to be able to support carplay they're going to have to enable Apple to take control of all the screens in the car not just a a window screen and this
is really frustrating to me because one of the issues that I've had with uh Teslas for example one of the one of my main reasons for not being interested in a Tesla for years even though on paper it was like what you're like a tech guy you should just have a Tesla right um one of my main issues was that I was locked into Tesla's operating system so yeah I could use Google Maps as long as Tesla decided I could use Google Maps like I I couldn't just plug in my phone and use whatever I wanted and it's been
shown now that you could totally even in a Tesla just run Android auto or run carplay in a window and get all that functionality that you want that way instead of relying on Tesla's uh Tesla's own inment operator but I was like no this is absolutely this is absolutely perfect I never have to be at the mercy of the car manufacturer who and Tesla you know what to their credit has been a lot better than traditional car manufacturers about this but I still just don't trust car manufacturers to
keep their software up to date whereas I trust myself to keep buying a new phone every time I need one which as it turns out is not very often but but I can do that and then I can just bring yeah I can just bring that new experience with me um and this I didn't realize would totally tank that because all I wanted was my phone to run in a little window on my dashboard I don't want I don't want my phone to completely take over the car I want my car to work like my car should and my phone to work like my
phone should and then just I can listen to whatever music I want on playlists that I have stored on my phone that's it that's all I'm asking for and I just don't understand why companies like apple have to have to flex like this and impose their will like God who cares you already sold the iPhone sorry go ahead go ahead yeah yeah and by the way no I was not rapping or doing weird uh gestures I was I was bringing Liberty and freedom to a bug that was bothering me um anyways moving
on Apple issued a statement saying that the lawsuit threatens who we are and would hinder our ability to create the kind of Technology people expect from Apple where Hardware software and services intersect many parallels are being dra Sor I'm gonna have to interrupt you again right here because I actually agree with that I agree extremely strongly with that this this lawsuit does threaten who are definitely is because apple apple are anti-competitive um and this would threaten that
in a big way um as for whether it would hinder their ability to create the kind of technology that people expect from Apple I don't think it would at all if anything I think this would open up the kind of technology that Apple creates which is really great honestly a lot of the time I think it would open up that technology to a wider array of users um so cool I guess I I really just I'm afraid I just don't see a downside and the thing is that the arguments that you'll get from I don't know what to
call them and I realize this is extremely disrespectful um but I just I'm so sorry I can't think of another word but just like the zombies um you know the kind of argument that you'll get from these zealots uh that will defend this multi-trillion multi-trillion dollar Corporation to the death like it's just it's this bizarre Dynamic that I don't understand like having this kind of parasocial relationship with a logo um you know the kind of arguments you'll get from them is you know I like the
closed ecosystem I like the Walled Garden I like I like everything that's great about having a Macbook and an iPhone and airpods and a Vision Pro and all the synergies that exist between all these products you can have that still not be locked down cool yeah then keep buying them all I'm not asking for anything to change for you I'm just asking for a way to update the firmware on the bloody product I bought without buying another product to and to not to not recognize the level of disrespect
that that is to BAS basically say yeah you have to you have to come to our store in order to update the firmware on this product if you don't didn't buy enough of our products I mean imagine for a second imagine for a second if to get a Windows update after you bought a Windows computer okay you had to go to a Microsoft store and have them install it for you imagine it like that's the thing you got to do is you got to in any case whether we're talking Democrat versus Republican PlayStation versus Xbox Apple
versus whatever you've got to take whatever that thing is and then you've got to pretend that someone you hate did it and decide if it would be okay and if it wouldn't be okay then it's not okay it it really is that's a good way to see it actually yeah yeah that's a good way to frame it um continuing on many parallels are being drawn to the Microsoft antitrust case which was like the last really major one of these they did it's not the last one they did it's the last Super major one they did um
which involved years of arguments rulings appeals of those rulings and eventually a settlement with Microsoft making a number of concessions uh Riley also notes here that uh I as in Riley uh have also seen analysts claim both that the lawsuit is well-founded and poorly founded an eventual messy compromise seems likely which yeah I mean you're going to have incredible amounts of money going into this from from apple and a bunch of money from the government the government doesn't want to lose so lots of money
versus government not wanting to lose going to take a while gonna be a big compromise the way that I see this playing out is the government winning enough that it will it will be such a huge distraction and such a large sunk cost for Apple by the time this whole thing plays out that they will at least if Microsoft is anything to go by they will for 20 years or so chill the math out on the whole anti-competitive business practices thing I mean some of this stuff has just been has been so
obvious for so long I mean look at the the epic games versus Apple thing I I don't think that epic you don't have to like Tim Sweeney you don't have to like epic games I don't want epic games store on my computers and I have I've I've gotten into it with Tim Sweeney in the past I wouldn't say that he's my favorite person ever but I and and I think that you know if we were to ignore the the personal motivations for this from Tim Sweeney where he obviously wants to make more money and grow his
company that would be ridiculous we shouldn't ignore that either but to disagree with his fundamental points that apple and these other Marketplace holders are engaging in anti-competitive behavior in order to lock in their enormous 30% take of every purchase that takes place on their platforms uh to disagree with that I feel like a demonstration that you don't really understand the behaviors that these companies are engaging in um and that you don't understand what anti-competitive means like yes it is
fine to build a product that has benefits if you use it with first party I mean let's take our screwdriver for example it works best with our first party shorty bits but there's a huge differing the product so that it works it fits 12 bits if you buy first-party ones and so that it had uh you know an RFID chip in the bits and the ratchet stopped functioning if you didn't buy our first party bits there's a huge huge difference between designing products that work well together and designing
products that punish users for not buying enough and for not playing by our  rules yeah it's it's interesting because uh you often hear the 30% thing and it gets compared to to steam which is which is intriguing um because there's there's some stuff there that makes sense and there's some stuff there that doesn't one is like if it's a if it's an ingame thing it doesn't necessarily have to go through Steam a lot of companies will do that because for DLC and stuff it's easier but there are some in-game
purchases that don't have to go through Steam also there's a lot of things that steam could do to be significantly more anti-competitive that they don't do um there's interesting stats I I'll come back to that in a moment there's interesting stats that make it look like oh steam is a little uh like in 2018 a group of valve staff tried to figure out how they how just how efficient they were being and found that they were making more money per head than Apple Facebook Etc nearly every Tech Giant out
there they found out that they were making in 2018 right "$78,400 per employee at" valve of any level and you compare that to Apple who makes rough machine oh absolutely you compare that to Apple who historically has incredible amounts of money in the bank and just rakes in cash you compare that to Apple Apple makes 47616 per employee which is like closer to half than anything else so Val is doing well at that 30% but they allow you to sell your game on your own platform if you want they sell they
allow you to sell your game on other platforms they're not determining oh you have to sell your game at at least the same price as it is on here remember Humble Bundle when they were popping off back in the day they were giving games out basically for free that you were activating on Steam and using steam service to download and valve was just chill with that they they are not engaging in a lot of these other anti-competitive things the 30% is a lot we can talk about that but that's
honestly a different conversation when there's a bunch of different libraries on Steam steam even allows you to use games that you have installed from Steam uh in a different launcher there's multiple other multi- launcher things I think even Nvidia cards these days you can launch games from their software as if anyone would want to do that um it it's it's interesting I I have some some issues with the 30% but there's a couple from people here uh hcky says I don't hear lonus
complaining about Microsoft only letting you play Xbox games on the Xbox then you weren't listening uh because that was a major major point for me for a long time was Microsoft's lip service that they were paying to gaming on Windows you know when they launched Vista they had this my games menu um and they they kept talking about how much they cared about Windows gaming and the windows gaming ecosystem man in the Xbox 360 and even to an extent the Xbox One days I never shut up about how L it
made that we would get these releases these crappy ports way down the line on PC and that and that Microsoft's Windows users were treated like second class citizens when functionally the Xbox was just a computer guys I never shut my mouth about that the reason you don't hear me complaining about it now is that it's not a problem right now games pass works on Windows and Xbox like nothing um many many games that you buy for the Xbox um I don't think it's all of them yet I haven't
looked into it recently but I know that there was a big shift that took place about three years ago where many games would actually have a dual license so you could play them on Windows or play them on Xbox they added keyboard and mouse support to the Xbox so you can just play your games with a keyboard and mouse which was a huge problem for me um as a as a PC Gamer I would look at an Xbox version of a game and be like oh great I get this in two years where I can use a proper set of peripherals with
this shooter game um so a lot of the problems that I've had over the years have been addressed that's why you don't really that's why you don't really see me complaining about it anymore because believe it or not I am not just a hater I don't complain about things for the sake of complaining about them I complain about them when they're bad and when they're wrong um this is one from Jen's wo over in twitch chat as an app developer and publisher I find the 30% tax both Apple and Google by the way no
one questions that epic sued both of them on one hand I find it high uh but I also get a lot of services for that I get a complete store System including invoicing payments management Etc I also get a review process which yes can be frustrating but also ensures a quality threshold for the apps being published nobody has a problem with that and I want to make this just Crystal Crystal Clear nobody not me not the doj not Tim Sweeny nobody has a problem with that the problem is not the 30% fee the
problem is not the complete solution with invoicing and and all these tools and review and ensuring user safety none of those are problems the problem is the lock the problem is the lock in the problem is that if I don't want your invoice in system if I don't want your payment processing I am forced out that's the problem the problem is that that review process so often I mean Luke what is the percentage of times that we had our IOS app blocked over a user safety or user security
issue uh quite a few it's not happening as much anymore just to be super clear for people watching this was a major thing like probably year and a half to two years ago is happening all the time like every other time and when it would happen it might happen multiple times for user safety or security oh uh I think never okay how many times were we blocked for something that was not that very often yeah my favorite one this is a little bit off topic yeah you might right I'll let Luke tell the story
because I'm laggy oh the Netflix one no I was going to talk about there was one time we got blocked cuz they said they they couldn't log in uh and then they sent us a screenshot of someone else's login portal while trying to input our information uh there was another time where they we got blocked because they said they couldn't log in and then I I looked at it was our login portal I looked at their login uh and they they just typed it wrong and I sent back I was like why are you typing anything
like why are you copy and pasting this this is crazy um I don't know what the the Netflix one what was it uh Netflix was doing something yeah where we we set up our yeah we it was the um the first thing you see when you launched the app it just it directed people to create an account on our site or something like that and basically um our team assumed that what we were doing was fine because Netflix for some reason had a special arrangement with apple where they were allowed to direct people to their own
portal um for H for subscriptions and they did not they outright did not allow people to subscribe through the app because Netflix's entire business model would be unsustainable if they gave Apple 30% of their gross and so they they had their they had their signup set up in such a way that you were just redirected and so we set up sorry I was just speaking to the audience I was saying I don't know that it still is or not this was this was a while ago yeah this was a while back so we set up
thinking okay well that's obviously okay because someone else is doing it we set up our app to work exactly the same way because believe it or not our business model being a video streaming platform for float plane is equally not sustainable if we're giving 30% of our growth to Apple we're we're not selling in-game Cosmetics uh we are we are not um you know selling just you know button mashing games or whatever else like we we have very significant costs associated with serving this video and
30% of gross is is not sustainable for us um to the point where we will invest Cycles into creating our own payment processing and our own subscription plan management and all of that stuff in order to make it sustainable and so we set it up in the same way that Netflix was doing it and our app got rejected and when we responded saying this is exactly the same as Netflix that was a long battle Yeah and right out the gate they were like yeah I can't even remember they did they they
said that you can't compare uh yourself to any other app on the platform it's not a valid argument um and I was like this is one of the biggest apps on the platform how is this possibly not a valid argument you think people aren't going to build things based off what they see on your thing and they were just like you can't compare to any other app this is what we're telling you you have to listen to what we say and it's like okay because and that was also really frustrating because I would
complain back when we were having a lot of problems I would complain about us getting blocked for x or y or B reason and people would message me and tweet at me and all this kind of stuff well my app got through with whatever I'm like yeah that doesn't mean anything in my experience there's no like it's all completely individual I'm having this problem I'm now dealing with this person on Apple side and it just is what it is there's I can't make any arguments based on precedent uh which is super frustrating
um yeah which is how arguments work by the way yeah precedent matters a lot yeah like and and again you've got to you've got to come back to would you be okay with it if someone that you hate did it so if Microsoft were to say oh yeah you know um valve oh oh this okay here here's here's a stupid thing you know oh yeah you know valve is allowed to have steam integrated enough into Windows networking so that when you switch to a wired connection it'll automatically go faster and use that
wired connection but um you know you play can't have can't have that so it'll just stay on Wi-Fi unless you manually disconnect your Wi-Fi and relaunch the app and um yeah too bad it's different rules for different applications you you'd be furious you you you'd be sitting there going well this is this is ridiculous it's ridiculous that they're gatekeeping this and that's exactly the argument here you just you can't gatekeep functionality like that um and for anyone who's going to sort of back
at me yes you can apple did it the answer is no you can't and the doj finally woke up from its 25e Slumber and figured it out um at the time back back in 1998 you know I was 12 so I didn't really understand I I used I used Internet Explorer and I thought Internet Explorer was fine because I didn't know any better I had all I had ever touched was uh Netscape Navigator which from my perception was a piece of garbage did I perceive it as a piece of garbage though because of Microsoft's anti-competitive
practices that effectively forced removed all of their all of their funding maybe but as a as a consumer I didn't understand the impact that Microsoft's Behavior was having on competing products and on their own product all I saw was the convenience just so convenient Windows comes with Internet Explorer it's so natural of course they're integrated because I was just a I was a kid I didn't get it now I am three times the age which has some downsides um but but definitely has some benefits
I I have I have the wisdom to look at the vision what Microsoft did back then to look at what apple is doing now and see the knock on effects of this see the way that this kind of platform gatekeeping harms me even if I don't understand it and if you are if you're a user who loves the Apple ecosystem let me let me try to attract you with honey instead of vinegar this time forcing Apple to compete harder is going to be good for you you want a hungry Apple you want a competitive
apple with bite you don't want an apple that is just going to sit and get fat and lazy and put billions of dollars into vanity projects that they ultimately cancel you want an apple that is trying to make the iPhone better an apple that recognizes like oh you know there's a serious there's a serious you know quality problem with um you know what I'm just going to go after a lower hanging fruit um you know oh there's a there's a small percentage of users who are still mad that you still can't move
around your app icons on the home screen to your heart's content that you have to create you know garbage folders wherever you and and make them invisible wherever you want to have an empty spot um we should deal with that let's get hungry let's fix problems um the fact that they took what was it three or four years to address those butterfly keyboards in their MacBooks you don't want that Apple you want the Apple that is that is scared of losing market share you want that you should know that yeah
yeah you want the Apple that is going to lower the price of iCloud because they don't just get to stuff it down your throat because they're forced to allow other Cloud providers like man how awesome would it be if someone like a back Blaze had the same level of API access and could have the same level of integration with iOS all of a sudden you wouldn't have to pay for freaking iCloud back Blaze is a perfectly good service and if Apple was forced to allow it onto their platform you would benefit
because they would have to compete with iCloud instead of just I mean has the pricing of iCloud when's the last time the pricing of iCloud changed never mind the pricing when's the minimum amount that they've provided when's the last time that  nothing yeah I don't know I know um there there's two interesting arguments to go along with this as well um I got both these from Theo but um one of them is that this is this is a shout out to us cuz it's bad for us but I I think he
was talking about places like twitch and stuff mostly at the time um but platforms that have a split with the creators on the platform so flow plane would be one of these twitch would be one of these YouTube maybe I don't think YouTube is largely operating this way but it's going to impact them to a certain degree even twitch it's only part of Their audience that this is going to impact but it is to a certain degree um any platform where you're splitting the income already this is an
additional split at and that's going to hurt those platforms disproportionately compared to other ones because uh like flow plane for instance that's a much bigger chunk that comes out of the pie before we have to try to split it with our creators that are on the platform so it it splits and then it splits again which is really really rough for for us and then you have platforms that have probably I I don't know the the other argument floating around is that there's there's platforms that are like carrying
the monetization of the App Store and there's platforms that are mostly just benefiting from it um because there's platforms that are really big and very important I think uh I think the example that Theo used was like banking apps banking apps are going to pay their apple developer fee and then nothing despite being a like huge requirement in the modern era for people to do banking with your bank at all is to have a banking app so you would this would be something that they would pay a
ton for but they're paying nothing so effectively getting subsidized by the the the Twitches the float planes the the mo mobile apps with microtransactions in them all all the things that are actually flowing a lot of money through this 30% cut is effectively subsidizing these other in a lot of cases enormous companies that just have to pay their developer fee or nothing if they're on the uh Google Play Store but it's both of those situations are like this doesn't feel like right this doesn't feel
good I don't know oh and there's no incentive for Apple to change it no no I'm here and there's no incentive for Apple to change any of that as long as they're making money yeah hand over fist I might add yeah and if they're if they're not if they are not um required to compete with anybody if they're able to just sit and maintain the status quo as long as it's comfortable and that's exactly what these kinds of antitrust cases are designed to combat is complacency in Comfort to force them to compete hard
and everyone absolutely everyone unless you own a whole bunch of Apple stock should be rooting for that and you know what even if you own a whole bunch of Apple stock you should still be rooting for it did did Microsoft get crippled by the 1998 antitrust was decoupling windows and Internet Explorer actually I'm I'm talking now long term because long term they're doing they're doing great right now they're crushing right now to be honest I'm I'm not an accountant okay this is not Financial advice but pretty
much anyone smart that you talk to who treats stocks like anything other than gambling is going to tell you you are buying these for the long term you're buying it because it's a company that you believe in because it's a vision you believe in it's something that you understand that's how you're actually supposed to buy stocks because you're supposed to be instead of trying to time the market you're supposed to be going for time in Market knowing that you know historically it has grown at X rate and
whatever the case may be um so with that in mind if you bought Microsoft long are you are you a sad camper today because of that lawsuit especially if you actually bought it right when that lawsuit came in you're you're probably doing super well because because they had to they had to fight they had to actually try and you know what have they learned anything in the long term I think no their Shenanigans with Edge these days honestly are probably worse than what they were doing with Internet Explorer
back in the 90s however with that said what I hope is that the doj wins an enormous settlement here and we see a bit of a return to good behavior because man has Edge ever gotten annoying I would love to see them go after Microsoft again honestly I would just love to see the doj get 10x the staff and see them go after a whole bunch of the just clown show behavior that we've seen around right to repair around anti-competitive practices around wal Garden ecosystems I'm just so tired of
it and I'm tired of us accepting it it's really frustrating yeah yeah HP printers let's go man I'm I'm kind of wondering I've been I've this been on my radar for a little bit I don't think they're in a spot right now for it to be a thing but some of the actions that Microsoft has been taking towards AI stuff has me going like you guys releasing the Beast again like what's going on here are you guys trying to completely control the entire AI space or no cuz sometimes it's like it get a little close but they
haven't they haven't actually done it yet but uh I wonder if this is going to feel like a shot across the bow I don't know we'll see I hope so I hope they're trying to make an example of them the fact that it's so so broad to me yeah they're going after everything I can see where people are coming from going like oh this is it's messy but the fact that it's so Broad in my mind is more of an indication that they are going for damage here so that I think they know they're not going to win everything yeah
but if they just if they're coming in going okay full broadside this is going to hurt and even if it doesn't hurt that much in terms of the final settlement this is going to be such a distraction this is going to be so costly in just in terms of the opportunity cost in terms of the time wasted I think the message to Apple is play nice or this is going to be an ongoing problem you are going to be defending yourself on all fronts and I just I hope I hope they stick to it yeah yeah that said it's an election
year so who knows right yeah that's true I um priorities change so fast in American politics these days well yeah you can't even just specify America there but yeah I agreed um yeah it's uh it's interesting because most people that I know because yeah like you you were 12 or whatever I was like nine I don't know um when the Microsoft thing happened most people talking to them about the about what happened um if you you've talked to about like how that felt back then and what they think about
the ramifications of it etc etc etc most sentiment that I have seen is that they wish that this type of thing happened more often what happened to more companies they'll point at some company now that's doing something and be like why aren't they going after them so yeah I think we should be happy that the people that if you're American I guess are you're you're paying them to do their job you should be happy I guess that they're doing their job um and hopefully they they keep doing it
because antiv is bad we can all wish they should do more of their job 100% I'm with you they should do more of their job but you know let's take what we can get yeah this is good this is good and like yeah I'm not American and a lot of you are probably not American but Apple being an American company is most vulnerable on American soil and Apple's is it their largest market or is it China now but at least one of their biggest markets it's either one or two I can't remember but this being's
biggest or second biggest Market um anything that Apple has to do for their American customers is very likely to trickle down to everyone else so it's a very very good thing for everyone else um yeah Jed Ora over on Twitch says the lawsuit reads like it was written by someone that was really Tech illiterate they blame Apple for the death of Windows phone and others instead of those companies making bad moves and that's a really good point uh I've I haven't read it Pages or however many pages it I I
haven't read it but I've skimmed a little bit of it and I've looked at some highlights of it that people have been talking about on Reddit that really do emphasize what you're talking about you're not wrong there are definitely some areas where it could have been improved by bringing in someone who really understands Tech and the history behind some of these things but again I I get that government competence is not going to be as high as private sector competence and I understand that
the doj is going to lose a lot of this um all I can hope for is that they win enough that we see a sizable enough settlement that apple is sufficiently wrist slapped to change their behavior in at least a temp for at least some temporary amount of time and that it causes every the rest of the industry to kind of wake up and go woo hold on a second like okay a great example this was when the FCC went after that uh that Xbox promotion where twitch streamers weren't disclosing that they
were paid to play games on Xbox this was back around the launch of the Xbox One it never got followed up as far as I can tell I don't think we saw let alone a high-profile case I don't think we saw a single additional case going after this kind of undisclosed uh product sponsorship um and paid sponsorship but what I will say is it brought about a significant shift it didn't clean the industry up completely there's still companies out there and there's still many many many
influencers out there that are doing dirty deals undisclosed deals but compared to what it was before then when it was complete Yeehaw like just wild west um I would say that it is markedly improved even now even eight years later or whatever we're up to eight or nine years later so I I I I am uncharacteristically optimistic is it naive maybe but we saw a big change in Microsoft's behavior for a long time in 1998 we saw a big change in Advertiser and influence behavior at least
temporarily um back when the FCC hit Microsoft for that Xbox promotion and I would I'm hoping I'm hoping that we uh Avon fox in flan says it's now fashionable to say you disclose yeah it is and some people don't some people fashion say they disclose and they disclose Sometimes some of that is an extremely major shift in viewer sentiment about creators monetizing their stuff extremely major when we first started any form of monetization no matter what you would get very significant hate and like a lot of it
from a lot of people people are really mad these days if you don't monetize your stuff people are like what are you doing you need to make money so you can do this as a career you need to monetize your stuff Play Those ads on ttch yeah that's that's like super common these days it is completely flipped so back in the day disclosing that you had this this is why doing stuff like that is bad disclosing that you had some type of agreement back in the day would have got you significant hate and potentially
lost you viewers and these days disclosing that you have it people are going to cheer for you and hope that you do better it has changed so much it's actually wild yeah unless they don't like the company that you have the agreement with but like in general it's seen positively anyways moving on topic two speaking about phones Windows phones Apple phones whatever minimal it's like a Kindle but it's a phone startup minimal launched a crowdfunding campaign for what they're
calling the minimal phone earlier this month while they haven't yet hit production they have a working prototype for a smartphone with a 3 and 1/2 in monochrome eink screen and a physical keyboard it has 4 gigs of RAM 128 gigs of storage the phone's OS is a custom version of Android 13 and the phone has app Bluetooth and 5G support despite that it's 15hz eink screen makes it unsuitable for watching videos or playing games the phone includes an 8 megapix front camera and a 16 megapixel main camera minimal
is currently aiming for a $350 price tag actually quite hey L do you want to uh maybe show the people the phone real quick can I oh you mean on my screen I understand I was like wait do I have one here yeah I can't screen share this week be on scare Duty we're working on it here we go here's their Kickstarter or Indiegogo page I guess not Kickstarter but yeah Big keyboard very very Blackberry Vibes um this looks like some form of text messaging application I'm not sure what one um and
it lookss like it would work fine for  PPI I gotta say Luke I think it's super cool but I am not into the physical keyboard I I get why they're doing it what I found is that even on a device that has the horsepower to be responsive typing on a nonresponsive screen technology is a big problem because you Visual and I'm one of those one of those weirdos who doesn't keep haptics on so I don't get haptic feedback what the I type I rely on the little yeah I rely on the little well what I find is they're
on most devices too laggy so it's a habit that I that I fell out of when phones every month um on some of them the ha leggy and so sloppy that it was just yucky uh so I would so I would turn off my hack and I'm just used to it so I kind of rely on popping up under my fingers and I rely on my complete really responsive to to type quickly we're we're like losing I don't think Dan's  though your audio is getting really bad and I think Dan left so I don't think there's any fixes coming for it we can
hear you but it's cutting out like half  Dan return okay well um with h physical not not too great not too into the physical keyboard their their Indiegogo Page by the way is is saying 4G so I'm not sure if the notes are wrong or if um something's going on here but yeah the the the essential features here says says 4G LTE um I yeah I don't know I haven't used a physical keyboard attached to a phone in so long that I don't know if I I can really say I feel like I would like it
or at least be okay with it but I I wouldn't really know until I actually tried it I do yeah I don't know I do very much you oh I don't necessarily miss it you remember how good it was no no I'm talking to Dan oh actually no I changed my statement I missed the blackberries swipe navigation system that was what I miss I don't yeah the keyboard I don't care about you it because what yeah I was saying you you missed the keyboard because it was so much better than not having a
keyboard back then it was so much better than T9 typing yeah but I went back to it for a little bit for a short circuit video um and it's it's it's a I'm sitting there going it's fine as long as absolutely everything you want to type is Alpha and you know as a bit of an alpha myself you know I'm in the manav verse uh you know um uh I can't I can't even man what's what can you think of the toxic manae thing uh uh can't think of anything you have red pills in your vitamins every
day I don't know yeah yeah yeah well that's that's good that's good uh how many how many manae creators do you  influencers I don't think so um trucks although I get them trucks and guns it shows up in my feet it shows up in my feet a lot because I like working out in chess um so YouTube is like you like working out and you like chess you must be into this stuff and I'm like get out of here I don't want it you're our demo yeah you stop do you have any idea as a as a married late 30s something how much
promotion I get for like secret meets and like Ashley madis and I'm just like how many times do I have to tell you how many times I got to tell you I'm not interested in this like not everyone who  abstinent yeah that's that's unfortunate I'm doing fine I uh I it's a good thing it's not unfortunate wow I'm telling  that that's not what I meant um uh the the the minimal phone I don't know I don't know if I'm necessarily into the keyboard or not sorry we're fighting with latency I don't know if
I'm necessarily into the keyboard or not but I am definitely interested in the concept I think the $350 price tag might actually be pretty good especially once you start being able to pick up the uh pick these up used um but I I think that there is a a fairly considerable war going on for like time and mind space and I think people are starting to recognize and understand that um um and I think tools like this could be very good because something that I've heard from do we lose lonus or is he just very
still I can't tell he's very still okay um something that I've heard because I've been encouraging people to turn on screen time limits on their phone um because like I have like uh Instagram for instance my brother my buddy darus and my and my girlfriend will send me Instagram things every once in a while so I check their their uh their shared things on there but I have it limited to like 5 minutes so that if I accidentally get stuck onto the homepage and start Doom scrolling it'll just shut it down
for me but something that's ridiculous about that is when it shuts it down for me it'll go you're out of time do you want to go to settings and give yourself more time like are you kidding me yeah I know for me that works I I won't go to settings I'll leave it and I'll just close the app a lot of people have communicated to me the second that comes up they're going to settings they're increasing their time it does nothing so like it would be actually nice to be able to have something that you like
can't necessarily do that with like maybe Instagram does work on here but it said it's not good enough for games you want to put Net Nanny on your phone like self-inflicted yeah I want to be able to yeah yeah I I want to like I want I want it to be harder to turn it off you want five more minutes yeah like that you oh man something like that alarm clock remember that alarm clock that you had for a little bit that would jump up and run around the room and you had to go chase it in order to to disable it yeah
until I booted like that where you have to where you have to do some kind of cumbersome thing and I think I definitely see where that could be where that could be a problem like that could be a problem if for some reason you were to set your phone app to be time limited and you needed to place an emergency call or something like that like I can see from a from a safety standpoint where there could be a situation where where this is a problem but I also think that for certain classes of apps I
agree with you 100% that there should be hardcore mode there should be like like you said get your get your heart get your heart rate above 120 for 15 minutes and you can have your Instagram back for I would love that I I would actually I would prefer that over my five minute thing because then if I if I want it if I'm like yeah I I oh man it would be cool too if it only bought you a little bit more time okay Luke tell me this I love this tell me this wait wait tell me this would you buy a product oh man we
are going way off we are going way off topic here would you buy a product that was essentially a lock boox okay a lock box for your peripheral plugs so you can't just like unplug them and plug something else in okay and then what it is is a an inter an inter not like an interposer like a pass through essentially it's like a pass through dongle for your mouse board and game controller okay and it has some kind of API integration with games so that you could actually do you are forced to do
that thing you tell yourself you're going to do which is every time you hit a load screen do 10 push-ups or whatever so it has like webcam thing and it's like I am not I am actually not going to give you back your keyboard mouse drop down and give me 10 Soldier you know like every time you're in a loading screen or whatever like dude would you pay for that product 100% that's so sick actually I wasn't sure where you were going with that for like a while but I'm I'm super into that because my thing is
I will do it I'll have like The Willpower to do it but I'll forget it it won't be that I'm like oh I just really don't want to so I'm not going to I'll just you know I'm playing a game I'm I'm more focused on like that I'm really annoyed that that guy just killed me or whatever and I I forget this plan that I had so I'll do it like a few times and then I I'll forget so if this thing is uh is is going to jump in and be like no like you just died or you just uh hit a loading screen like you
said or whatever else like whatever event that you planned out happened now you have to go do that thing um sit-ups or push-ups or or whatever it is that would be awesome so sweet I think everyone everyone knows what's good for them and everyone has Willow sometimes so the the really critical I don't want to I don't know what to call it is it a peripheral is it a is it a system whatever it is the really integral element is locking down your system so that you can't just plug in
another set of peripherals so that your peripherals are are are stuck connect ed through the the translation dongle so that the removal of it is extremely inconvenient so kind of like the the app time limit where you can uh where you have to like do something in order to overcome it there needs to be like a like an accountabil buddy you know someone else to enter a password for you and it's one of those things where you could set it up you could set it that up one time while you've got the willpower
right but it's all about not you know not giving you an easy out like obviously if you need to just use your computer and your arms are tired at some point you've got a book report due right like obviously that's a different situation and your accountability buddy I'm sure would be happy to unlock your system for you accountabil bu but in every other situation if you're just gaming oh I ripped it off South Park that's not my word all right but if I but but if if I'm just gaming or
whatever there should be no convenient way to keep going and honestly if the outcome is that you just kind of go screw it I don't need to game that badly anymore I'm g go touch grass you know what that's pretty good too I don't see I don't see a problem with that Lis just came up with the next hot accessory for streamers honestly a lot of the big streamers would be into it and I think a lot of them super wouldn't oh yeah like based on the physique I could definitely see like man some of those guys are
shredded I'm sitting here going do you do anything but sit at your computer or sit in the gym that sounds like a pretty I don't see how you have time for I'm into that that that is that is my goal most of the time to be completely honest lifting and clicking on heads that's the life you want buddy yeah um I'm trying to find mine I always creatine and G fuel I I don't need no protein shake I subsist on salt oh yeah you got to get that soilent yeah okay yeah here we go I found it so
like my limits right now is I have five minutes on Instagram I have uh 5 minutes on X and I have 10 minutes on YouTube and my thing is like the it might not sound super long for each one of those if you if you combine that that's a significant amount of time to just be staring at my screen like doing nothing of value to be completely honest because if I'm watching YouTube on my phone for example I'm not going to be watching something of significant value I'm going to be
like on the toilet watching a short or something and then if that ends I don't want to start Doom scrolling so like it yeah it should lock it and then it's over and then that's fine and my average since I started doing this my average screen time per day total has been steadily going down which is good interested to see interested to see them Implement a per domain limit in Chrome because I don't necessarily want to not be able for example I don't use the Reddit app but if I you know if I'm just like
yeah I don't want to be on on Reddit more than 10 minutes a day I I'd love to be able to set it so that that domain just won't uh won't refresh anymore but that's really cool I like that I don't think that's a feature but that's really cool I I do use the Reddit app and I think I have mine locked down it's just not showing because I haven't opened Reddit in a while but I have a timer on that one too I just try to stay away from Reddit a little bit these days um but yeah I've I've any anything that
I'm like opening if I notice like yeah like my buy a incredible amount my most used app is YouTube music which is fine uh and then it's like teams and slack and stuff like it's that has that has been a pretty big Improvement like  see yeah screen time YouTube music for two and a half hours that doesn't actually seem believable I bet you my screen was locked but whatever maybe it got bumped and it was open or something but um yeah screen time is going down which is good I I think it's
like it's actually wild um how negative it is for for you so buying something like minimal phone or if some other product comes out similar to what lonus is talking about and using it to honestly better your life I think is like super valuable just Doom scrolling like there's a there's a reason why using the web back in the day used to be called surfing the web and why using the web these days is often referred to as Doom scrolling like it it used to be a bit different than it is now and the the
thing that it is now is honestly very uh competitive for your brain space and I think you should do active things in order to like Wrangle control of your brain back because there's billions and billions and billions of dollars right now right not necessarily but I think you should be conscious about what you're doing on YouTube well you could do it on your computer a lot of it's like being on the phone yeah that too done easy um a lot of it in my opinion is just literally
specifically being on the phone because like I mean I mean the posture of it what you end up physically doing not very good Etc but oh I am dude I am so unhappy with like my typical like neck posture and it's one of those things where like I I try to be aware of it a bit but it's like it's hard try using your phone like this like no one does this no nobody's doing this like you watch people walk around no one's walking around like this like everyone's walking around down like this it's bad y
it's not good okay's this thing the rest of the show also I'm loving how well this lines up right now in spite of my head being super tiny it is pretty good there's this whole thing about like um it's not necessarily so much posture itself although posture might be more aesthetic but if you think about the simple idea of weight being supported by bone I think is exactly how it said weight being supported by bone instead of weight being supported by muscle if you're curled like this your muscles
trying to hold yourself together and if you're straight up your bone is just sitting on itself it's way better for you a lot better for you there we go uh do you want to explain merch messages oh right yes merch messages are the way to interact with the show uh don't buy a twitch bit don't buy a Super Chat merch messages are the way to go all you got to do is head to LTT store.com where we've got a few updates for you guys and in when you're in the cart there'll be a little box anytime
we're live and you can leave a merch message it'll go to producer Dan who I would normally uh Hey Luke's gonna do it no he's not I saw his hand reach for what I thought was a it actually controls you there's lonus wait for some yeah okay whatever okay fine well it'll go to producer Dan who will curate your message for me and Luke to talk about or reply to it himself or just pop it up on the bottom of the screen so that you guys can uh see a little shout out for your mom or a proposal for your loved
ones or you know whatever the case may be uh we have actually we have actually had people propose on W show before which I think is pretty funny uh anyway the point is we will try our best to respond to your merch message in some way last week was an example of a week where we did not get to all of them because there was like a thousand or something um but the worst case scenario is you'll get some quality merchandises the mail instead of just throwing money at a screen which has always offended me
a little bit um no you know nothing against the streamers who rely on that and the people who enjoy that kind of thing yeah it's just not my jam and I I I like that if you're going to spend money you should you should definitely get some quality merchandise in return uh so before we do a few merch messages to show you guys how it works I have a couple of little uh merch updates for the store uh retro screwdriver uh is still running with free shipping for your entire order um we had a couple
people ask us yes this temporary deal which ends March 29th is applicable to International orders so if you haven't picked up a screwdriver yet the time to do it is now pick up the Retro screwdriver Luke do you want to pull that up on the screen sure pick up the Retro colorway of the screwdriver you will get free shipping on your entire order that is internationally so um hey do me a favor grab a few other things while you're at it that would be great because international shipping is pretty
expensive and this is a good time to just grab anything else that you want from the store because hey free shipping um might I recommend our new cable management arches we've also got uh what what else is really cool and people are super into Tech saac um is in stock right now and has really good reviews yeah magnetic man dude I wasn't sure Luke I love this I wasn't sure this was one of those products that um I was like do people want ugle management solution this badly I don't know turns out the
answer is yes it just looks so good these things are crushing it um they're absolutely crushing it it's just like every every frustration that I've ever had with like oh I used zip ties this time now I need to go get zip forget it I'm just not going to going to bother or like the velcro ties you know Long Live velcro ties they're great but they're not perfect they're such a if you use them properly and really cinch them tight they's such a pain in the butt to add something to magnetism man magnets
they fix it how do they work freaking love them well is the one of the top uploaded things on the Reddit right now is someone using one of the Arches to open their fridge that has a broken hand I wonder if I can find that the magets are super strong um just trying to think what else is uh what else is great to pick up on the store man we launched so many products that I feel like some things end up kind of buried uh the Dropout hoodie that I'm wearing that's a that's a really good one it's super  um
yeah oh the Steve the Steve is doing really well that uh that mock neck speaking of the show being largely about Apple this week anyway yeah so LTT store.com anyway Dan do you want to show what a curated merch message looks like Sure hold on we're looking at the the fridge door he just used the normal magnets now he's using ours nice nice we'll watch it again it's only 11 seconds so he's got a stack of magnets which then being in a stack can help two stacks two stack oh I even
notice yeah he's got two stacks and then just yeah one handle they also sell a bigger size if you want to be able to get more fingers  there all right anyways curated merch Mage that was unintentional I'm very sorry I'm not a very good shill not sorry I am sorry I'm blushing uh you have always recommended dram ssds but unfortunately most ssds only have SLC cash has your opinion on dless ssds changed much sometimes you guys use them  so I it's one of those things where I feel
like and you know what I don't have unfortunately I don't have a I don't have a rational uh basis for this and sometimes things are sometimes things do be like that though um I feel like dless is still the way that I would go if I could if I could afford the extra in a particular budget for my build and the reason for that is that it does put a little bit less stress on the nand in the long term is this going to be a problem within the reasonable life life expectancy of an
SSD probably not using using the The nand Flash as an SLC cache to accelerate the fun the the drive or using system memory so so many ssds these days support using a little bit of system system memory to um to make up for the function of a of a dedicated Dam cache on your SSD and that aside from the small performance hit is not problematic at all uh relying on the nand itself to accelerate the SSD um can cause a little bit of extra wear even then is that going to be a problem in the long term
um probably not you know I think that in the early days of ssds especially when we were using SLC or two bit Percell mlc there was a lot of hand ringing and stress about how our ssds had a finite number of right cycles and they were only going to last for a little while and they basically had a had a countdown timer they had a ticking clock on them and and and we we stressed a lot about it and some of that was valid especially for like an Enterprise application where these things are going to be overwritten
you know multiple times per day but for the average user I mean think about it how how often are you overwriting that SSD and if it can support hundreds or in some cases thousands of cycles of being overwritten is that really ever going to be a problem um yeah so it's not rational but I would still I would still take a dam cash SSD over a over a dless SSD assuming that you know they're at the same price um I don't know that I would but with that said if I were to buy a system so let's say I picked up an Rog
Ally or a steam deck or a laptop and it had a dless SSD in it am I going to notice am I going to bother to replace it no and especially if I was picking up a game drive like a secondary game Drive I don't know direct storage might matter at some point the first couple of games to implemented it hasn't really mattered but for direct storage it might matter at some point um so for like a secondary game drive just my my game dump um would I bother to get a d cash SSD absolutely
not for that where I'm not going to have any data that matters and you know everything could just be replaced by downloading the games again from Steam just get whatever the cheapest possible storage from a a reasonably respected brand would be um inmore in float plane chat says them King spec ssds die quickly though I I mean that may be true that may not be true that may be anecdotal I don't I don't have any any trustworthy data on whether kingspec ssds die quickly or not
but if they do I would say it's probably less to do with the lack of dram cach and probably more to do with the quality of the nand there's been some recent scandals particularly in USB thumb drives and SD cards around lowquality nand Flash from Rando suppliers or in some cases used nand being used in these devices that has an extremely extremely short life cycle man I would love to see that product the the the SSD nand USB thumb drive you know like the the a grade nand chip thumb drive
I'm not aware of anybody who sells that anymore premium thumb drives used to be a thing from the lights of you know brand like Patriot or whatever else but I'm I'm not convinced that they exist anymore apparently they exist okay does anyone have an example who who makes who  days uh build it yourself with an m.2 I mean yes that is what I do um apparently Corsair has one SanDisk and Samsung have them but which one specifically guys because don't tell me that every Samsung one is a good is good
quality nand there's no way uh give me a  model let's see Samsung bar plus someone says I've never heard of a Samsung bar plus me neither and apparently neither have you you have no idea what you're  about apparently the SanDisk one  oh my God okay I have to go back to this unfortunately I can't share with you guys right now uh oh I couldn't find it I I brought a bunch of Samsung Sound Bars no I found bar pluses for sure how did you not find it maybe you're on that Japan
Google I'm trying to find the right one and then I'm going to screen share yeah you can force yourself on with you guys no I don't think so I got this though sir Samsung bar plus uh 3.1 flash drive 256 gigs speed in style move files in a Flash rugged refinement I'm not seeing like St it says I can screen share look at that I uh I totally didn't even know that was a thing now how do I how do I make this you make it big you need this quick well no no it's fine it's fine hold on no
I'll just I'll just show you I'll just show you okay so everything you're looking at right here is a sponsored Amazon result it's really small you're looking at right here I'm highlighting it I see I see I see everything you're looking at right here is a spal result you're looking at here is the same Amazon result but not sponsored wow and then this is people  ask that is about old at 100% scaling at I believe this is a 1440p  unbelievable I have to go here to find oh wait is that this result no this is a
different WD page this may be the actual result right under the fold so you can tell they totally knew they 100% knew what I actually wanted they just put it below the fold below all their sponsored crap anyway okay I'm going to stop screen sharing now if I can figure out how to do that oh I'm screening someone someone suggested that I use kogi I'd never heard of it apparently it's a premium uh like pay to access I think I'm not sure um okay so this is a portable SSD this is not what I was this is not
really a thumb drive I wanted something in that thumb drive form factor that is just using higher quality nand like an SSD the bar plus is that what the bar pluses it doesn't look very big okay I'm gonna try searching for it again oh my God karaoke I I have 100% had normal flash drives that are that are physically bigger than this 100% multiple of them oh yeah this one this one looks fine okay so the bar plus is a trustworthy drive to store your valuable data okay so it looks like this is the
one this is the thing I want yeah with a nice little on  time do they actually say like how many how many total rights it's rated at or are they just saying Samsung makes a lot of Nan Flash and our experts in Nan flash therefore you should trust it cuz I don't actually see anything that indicates exactly what n chips are in this thing I'm not sure I can't find  either they just say it's fast uh and  terrible are they they're most on Samsung's own site the reviews are awful 
down yeah one and done stopped working after 2 months far from announced speeds poor right speeds protected registration fast read speeds poor right speeds only lasted seven months those are the first eight reviews when I scroll down oh you are on a different page than me mine is like overall 4.5 I'm on the Canada page I guess my my top ones are.2 and has a lot of negative ones my top ones are uh impressive and stylish amazing high quality flash drive solid secure never fails future repeat customer here
durability yeah I don't know I don't know man uh Napalm uh in twitch chat in typical twitch manner has apparently put their life savings into Intel thanks for the info guys I made it very clear that's not Financial advice I don't want you to do that please don't do that yeah don't do that thank you bye apparently the bar plus had some issues for a while with is below 128 gigs so those might be okay which makes sense or it might be that they're not using super super great quality nand and
in lower capacities those low overall rights are revealing themselves a lot faster I wantan to I want to okay I'll give a screen share for a second I don't know how well you can see this Linus but they show like you know the bar plus deployed in a few different scenarios it's on this guy like wrist uh bead thingy like okay that looks pretty cool it's probably really annoying having it whack into your hand all the time and then okay it's just plugged into a laptop that's fine and then the weirdest
spot to permanently have a flash drive like ever really just attached to the pull tab of the side pocket of your backpack have you seen the one that's in the back of a shovel basically you're telling what you're telling me you want to see an even dummer over engineered pull tab on the LT backpack going forward P tab is the flash drive yes yeah you see this and a carabiner with a flash drive in it Carabiner and flash drive there we go you listening to tan T to redesign tinan is screaming back to
square one I can hear him I can hear and to be clear guys when I was talking about Intel I was talking like very longterm I was talking like multi-year Outlook so please I none of it is financial advice I was just saying I I like I like their trajectory competing with tsmc and geopolitical tensions around tsmc and Intel being a place to Fab things I that that's that's all I was saying I was saying I like gel singer's Vision okay that's all I'm saying yeah you like this stock damn it
you guys he just likes the stock there you go I I just like the stock not Financial advice for the time  do maybe we should move on to uh some more topics about that guys uh wait no we still need to do a merch message uh sure okay we can do another one hi dlll and future me my question is what do you guys think about non- major brand gpus I've had an Ino 3D 390 for a year now with no issues but I heard it's not the case with Chinese Brands 03d is huge I forget who um yeah in3d is PC
partner um so in3d is a flipping enor enormous aib uh so they own Zotac uh inov Vision or Ino 3D um they own hold on uh consumer electronics um they're like a huge OEM uh gaming here we go man they do digital signage Logistics Casino industry stuff yeah you you own a   yeah good job yeah oh  now sure we get to game at work everyone everyone the planet gets to game at work now LinkedIn has confirmed that they will be introducing gaming features and that they are currently working on three
games called Queens inference and cross climb it's unclear if linkedin's parent company Microsoft will be involved in any way other than owning the whole company uh but it appears that these games will be puzzle games like Wordle or sodoku researcher Nema AI uh says that the code for the new features contains a leaderboard that ranks companies by their employees in game scores according to a LinkedIn spokesperson the games are intended to unlock a bit of fun deepen relationships
and hopefully spark the opportunity for conversations which means everyone gets to game at work now just kidding this sounds really  okay why are you being such a hater I mean I can def what do they do they run did LinkedIn run out of things to make that that's my real question you understand that this whole thing was your idea right was it wow Pro that could make sense what did I say oh no oh no when  online okay so he cut out there but what he what he was saying was when you took
one online 2014 yeah yeah sorry you're cutting so I got to inform the people got you back now so he's back now just send it again you took one online course in gamification in 2014 I think it was or 2016 and you came back to work the next day all fired up about your ideas for turning basically everything on the LTT Forum into some kind of gamified thing everything from interacting with posts to responding to them to updating profile pictures was going to be gamified and if I recall correctly we
actually put together we we put together what was going to be like kind of a compelling plan to make it like a tech Hub um like buy sell trade was going to be gamified in some way and there were going to be incentives for like participation and uh we were basically like yeah we could like turn it into like a social media platform essentially by making like gamified and it was it was actually a really cool idea and now you're just mad because LinkedIn got there first yeah well we realized that forums
were horrendously dying and never coming back so um kind of paused that plan a little bit um but yeah I I don't know I I guess they're taking game vacation extremely literally here just going like all right let's just add an actual video game um which is kind of sick I I just I don't know it it it reeks of like they either ran out of things to do or they wanted to do some type of like uh fun hackathon thingy and and people ended up making games and they're like should we do something with this sure
let's give it to the people um I don't know it seems so odd I I can't imagine any comp there's going to be like one company out there that for some reason like cares about this a lot and like actually has like dedicated time for their people to like compete on these games there's going to be one but that company's going to be very silly I don't think so and there's going to be no more other than I think there's just going to be people who just want to play games and companies being kind of
annoyed about this I love the idea that if you do play this at work your boss will probably be able to see that you did that and be like hey wait what speaking of should we get into to uh a big topic here sure what when glass door is not 100% Anonymous glass door has been snitching according to ours Technica software professional who emailed glass stor customer support to request the removal of information from her decade old account instead found that glassor took the name that
she provided in that email and added it to her glass door profile without her permission they then repeatedly denied requests to remove her name from her profile insisting that no one else would see the information she then attempted to delete the account but found that this only deactivated the account and didn't remove the problematic information she finally requested a complete data eraser which deleted the glass door account but didn't delete the associated Fishbowl account that glor
had created for her without her permission glor acquired professional networking site Fishbowl this is the first I'm hearing of it in 2021 and began integrating the two sites last July including automatically signing up glass door users for Fishbowl accounts I don't think that's okay like as fish requires user verification glassor has begun requiring more information and has changed its terms of service to include language that says that they may update your profile with information we obtain from third
parties some users have reported details like the name of their employer or home City being changed without permission or without a notification that new information was sometimes seriously inaccurate like a worker in California being listed as living in England glassor claims that they vigorously defend their users right to Anonymous free speech in court um so our discussion question is does insisting on collecting this information undermine glass door's Mission and what is the
risk of keeping it and I think these are fairly self-explanatory yes collecting this information does undermine glass door's Mission and the risk of keeping it is potentially outing whether it's accidental or whether it's on purpose potentially outing Anonymous whistleblowers that rely on platforms glass door in order to speak out against their employee employers by the way you're coming through super we we were able to understand all that but you are like very lowquality roboting oh is it fixed
now I will shut up for a bit no yeah you're you're roboting really heavy um yeah it's that's that's a really that's a rough one I I will warn people as well that if you're not at a really big company it can be pretty obvious who you are when you leave a glass store so just keep that in mind um but GL yeah the whole idea of this is that it's supposed to be super Anonymous so this is pretty obviously pretty sketchy what's the risk of keeping it uh the risk of keeping it is really high
because you risk retaliation from from the employer um and potentially depending on what you write you risk your higher ability uh because if a prospective company is able to find the glass door review that you're leaving and it's like really really emotionally charged or something like that it could potentially hurt your higher ability which uh well as is so often the case the risk is not to glass door though nothing will happen to them yep the risk is just to their users that had no say
in any of this which is extremely frustrating yeah definitely absolutely uh something that isn't super frustrating is steam families launching in beta valve has launched steam families on the steam beta client uh which is in quote Oh we should do sponsors the card is not there we listen to the cards we should do sponsors okay all right do you want me to do it because you sound like robot man yeah that would be good okay got it uh let me know when you're ready Dan wow so so respectful normally I

lus working on what oh I can't do that for you because I don't have access to that at all I don't think I can hear him by the way uh you should be able to hear him oh there we go everything's fine I love it you might have to ask your wife L nice thanks oh no h that is not easy right now Luke will have to do it for you then I don't have access to any of those what I I couldn't hear him what's happening oh he was just just he is texting me oh I can't access the um merch messages
dashboard because my work account doesn't have access for some reason that is because of Luke that um I think that's Aon so now the workaround is I have to lock into I have to log into some account that I don't have the TFA for to get access to a code for another account that in order to get its tofa in order to yeah so you can see where this is going I I can't access the dashboard do you need it I mean it would be it'd be nice to be able to access the dash you don't need
it also you could have prepared this oh my God I don't think this is my fault just because we have security features access I don't think so yeah well okay actually your work your work account is supposed to access  wrong I think you're wrong he says use Microsoft not Google use Microsoft oh were you using Google well why can't I use my because the if you paid attention to Monday morning meetings we migrated single sign on in Monday morning me he's come to about as many in emails he should know he's come
to about as many as you have Luke got him I have a I'm I have my own Monday morning meetings okay yeah well where's our email blast for your Monday morning meetings you don't need to know I want to know what you're doing with your full stack systems how is kubernetes going I don't know well I'm I'm doing a state of the union next Monday so you'll you'll find out some stuff then um apparent it's the anniversary of the hack right now yeah that's kind of cool is it really I wish
we were back there again crap has it been a year I wish we were doing it again dude I'm I'm working tomorrow I could just stay here all night I'm down I can work out and click on heads I want I want this life want this life that's all I need to be a happy boy that's all I need if it's like oh I'm sad it's like hm what have I not done in a while is it either working out or is it clicking on heads there's probably one of them and if I do that thing I'll probably no longer be sad anymore that's 
yep we've lost lus yeah he's gone I can do nothing no no I'm here he's not gone uh he's trying to geta for his Microsoft account now that's what I bet you that's what he's doing  denied I hate so the Microsoft one is so annoying it it does that so often it'll just be like no no you're not allowed you have to type in a number and then you have to also biometrically authenticate with your phone it's like what how many times do you how and then you have to like to be able to access the Microsoft authenticator
app you have to biometrically authenticate and then to be able to approve the login request you have to biometrically authenticate again it's like bro come on this is why I just keep everything on post notes it says it doesn't have  that I hate you all I don't like being a real company can we just go back to having one shared Microsoft account we would probably save money as well just have all the usernames and passwords in a in a sheet in a Google sheet again no we would need
we would need to log into Google to to like get access to that I gotta I gotta send a message so I remember to do this next week oh my God okay Dan what are we supposed to be doing right now aren't we supposed to be doing merch messages I guess I guess I don't even know anymore uh sure no no we're supposed to do topics we finished merch messages and then I was going to do another topic and we went into sponsors yeah and then after sponsors we do three more merch messages we're back I was doing three
things at once during that sponsor seg so sorry I didn't put the card up uh Hi D during the GPU pandemic did you hear anything about how sales of peripherals  affected probably they went up a lot that would be my guess I mean almost anything related to computers and Technology went up a lot during the pandemic and then went down yeah hi bearded Tech guy one bearded Tech Guy 2 and oh has the preliminary data from the lab influenced any personal purchases from any of y'all
yet either steering towards or away from  product not going to lie I was reading FL plan chat I didn't hear that uh the labs see this is why I need access to the dashboard so there's a Galaxy S7 somewhere that I need a code from oh I I can I can do that for you oh my gosh hi has the labs made you buy a product yet because you saw good things from uh the that thing no not for me personally but I guarantee you that it will eventually do I have to tap it'll happen it it resulted in me getting a
product kind of the processor in my most recent build oh oh boy oh yeah yeah 7800 X 3D the you got the worst of the best yeah and then and then got a better one it was dead nice yeah that worked for oh AJ says I should have access now oh hey nice brought to you by me on a random train in Japan wait you guys are in the same country I didn't really put this together until now AJ lonus is in Japan no way that's hilarious that is hilarious I hope you're enjoying your trip AJ and lonus I mean we're both working
apparently so yeah victory for me dude oh so good could have some meetings oh man that's really funny that's actually kind of interesting uh like everyone I know is going to Japan right now dude yeah I was I was talking to someone about this I showed the dashboard for a second and then now it's prompting me for a password yeah well it loads without the like the hooks or whatever so no data is actually going to flow through the one that you see for a second it's just the just the
front end um was I going to say I don't like technology uh I had something to say oh yeah Japan was one of those countries that stayed closed for a really long time um so people that had wanted to go visit there are are kind of all you know they had to wait for a pretty significant amount of time so people are kind of rushing in right now I think that's what's going on um they also yeah there's also a super like Budget Airline zip air that just opened up Service Direct service from Vancouver
to Japan uh we have a friend that paid like $700 each for direct flights and like yeah sure it's economy or whatever but like honestly I would rather sit in economy on a on a newly retrofitted plane than sit in business class on an old plane like they have these little trays that fit your phone and it's just like oh this is great this is they they have no on built-in Entertainment System but they have somewhere for me to put the one I brought with me which is perfect and exactly what I wanted anyway
uh so I set up my kids with a switch sitting in there and all three of them side by side and they just like were able to play switch games uh so yeah they had a pretty good flight honestly um I would love it if the screens on planes just had an HDMI in and you could just  um did a correct got okay okay Che um okay a more I want to talk about you being in Japan but we should do more merch messages sure we should keep that rolling uh a long while back there was a frequent string of shows where either
one of you both couldn't make it since then you've been been in you've been on a zero Miss streak was it an attempt to test the waters on many hosts no it was um basically us kind of accepting that we couldn't make it to the show sometimes and being totally fine with someone else hosting it and then we were totally both able to make it to the show for a very very very long time because of various lockdown related reasons we weren't going anywhere we weren't doing anything so we were always
on Wow and then it's just become a meaningless dick measuring competition to see who can keep the street going the longest and if there's one thing that neither Luke nor I will accept it's that um one of us definitely has a bigger dick it isn't me and um I'll never admit it oh I guess that means I'm here to keep both of you honest there's now no excuse for the wano to not happen yeah so through through various sicknesses and various vacations and various time zones and Etc we've just always somehow made it
work yep yep and I and now that we've both made it work um there's just like neither of us is going to back down no matter no matter how much we both know the answer I I've had I've had the like Theory craft of like if I end up in the hospital can I convince them to like give me a laptop with a webcam so I can do w i i have actually thought about that like okay so lonus is in the hospital is it go to make him do the WAN show still uh like who would who would  attorney all right you okay you know
what she'll enable this could Ivon appear in my St does does that work does it work like that no no I think Ivon is me legally no no no no if she had power of attorney to let me point a camera at you if you are unconscious then that's okay uh but you you I think that's fair that's what I'm asking basically that's what I'm asking yeah so if if she talks and I just am and I'm just your unconscious body yeah that's fair I have I have planned for these contingen count I think that counts yep okay I think
that counts I think that counts excellent yeah and honestly if if all three of us agree then it it just does I think lus would be more upset if he missed wano while he was unconscious yeah honestly me too honestly I'd wake up I'd wake up extremely angry yeah yes like what do you mean way back down my life over I lost to Luke it's over it's done take me out coach coma show oh man oh man if the show starts too late it ends up like that honestly I think we're pretty good at
keeping energy up not always I guess uh let's see yeah do you want any more we one more I think sure as a physician we take patient privacy seriously we can lose our jobs or be fined if patient identifiers leak what would you say is an appropriate fine for companies having customer data stolen oh yeah this one's really rough   man what constitutes customer data and like now you're kind of weaponizing like if if you have a competitor now you have a weapon of either putting a bounty on
them or trying to do it yourself like breaking into their stuff and then leaking their data so that you can get them  that's an interesting angle I didn't really think of like it's it's actually an issue because companies that do a very significant amount to protect their customers data do sometimes get broken into you know like yeah oh and it's it's one of those things where it's like who's liable if something gets really like stolen like not not leaked not carelessly like if if if
if you put a lock on your door and you have an alarm system and you have a dog and someone breaks into your house and takes your stuff and the insurance company is basically just like I don't know yeah you should have had a automated turret um no coverage you're going to be mad right like why is it is it on you're the victim actually yikes yeah like do we really just want to line a bunch of insurance company's Pockets because every company is now going to need mad insurance for
this I don't know it's it's a tough one for me I think I think in general for most sites and services people just need to be more aware that they're sharing their data and potentially just not sometimes if they're uncomfortable with it um cough cough things like 23 and me and stuff like that um and with other things like when it starts to touch things like medical and and and whatnot um maybe maybe certain levels of personal data should have something like that on it uh to try to push companies
to try to make sure that they have good security practices and maybe yeah maybe have insurance in place so that if if People's identities are stolen or whatnot because of this that that insurance can step in and give them a certain amount of payout so they can have money uh in the bank to deal with the financial ramifications of that scenario um security is barely thought about that's just not true dude um it's like actually not true um it depends security is barely thought
about at some very tiny companies that can't do it because having a full-time security specialist on your staff is going to be very expensive uh developers are very expensive as is and then having one specialized on something assum you find one that's actually good and not just bsing you and you just don't understand it well enough to know if they're actually doing a good job 100% that's a big thing and is that one person enough to hold back The Horde um and even if you have a super super super
good security team you're still going to have vulnerabilities here or there so like it might still happen I don't know it's um it's tough I would love to I'm usually on the like you know find them harder crush the companies kind of side of things um and I know this might be this might seem hypocritical because I run a web company thatch technically has some amount of user data but I just I don't think all things are equal here um negligence is the big one but I don't know exactly how to define it yeah how
do you how do you really get someone on that um like like if we if we think about the Forum leak like you you brought up earlier if you think of someone if you think this thing that this company you like is doing is good if you had a company that you didn't like doing the same thing would you still think it's good well it's like okay let's flip it around if you if you think finding these companies for this thing is good are you just as okay with that fine applying to you if that happens to you that's what
that's how I'm trying to kind of place it right now so like when the Forum leak happened it's like yeah it sucked do I think we should have been fined for that I don't really think so I don't think we did anything particularly wrong and I don't think that the that the data that was on the Forum was like really too crushing for anybody I think the main bad part was um like you know you probably shouldn't have two passwords used in the same spot um it wasn't really that big of deal at
the end day two yeah yeah yeah sorry um but if you're a a bank or uh I don't know someone who deals with like passport details or um sure medical things or things of super high value numers or social insurance numbers yeah maybe there should be more precedents on there I don't know necessarily what those requirements would have to be but like yeah I don't know I I think it should maybe be a sliding scale is what I'm trying to say and to be clear neither of us are condoning in any way the sale of this
private data and then you know the subsequent leakage of it from somewhere else I mean that that is 100% on you you should be fined into Oblivion but but in terms of just absolutely destroying any company that has one employee potentially make a mistake and they were doing their best like uh I don't necessarily think that  either can we talk about steam families now though yeah let's jump let's jump back to that speaking of things that were unsustainable playing games with my
kids is a huge problem because up until now um every kid needs their own copy of everything every kid needs their own copy of everything and that will still be true to an extent for anything that's online based multiplayer where we all want to play at the same time but one of the bigger problems for me has been that unlike you know 10 20 years ago where I could buy a library of games and anyone could play any one of those games at a time without interfering with the others
the way that it's worked on steam up until now you can share your library with your family but only one of you can use that library at a time and it didn't used to be such a big problem because offline mode was a was a pretty good workaround you could just launch the game on one machine go offline then launch a different game on another machine and leave that one online if they're playing something that requires multiplayer or in many cases you could just get away with it you could just
launch the games one after another and it would just kind of work even though strictly speaking it wasn't supposed to work but then valve locked down offline mode a lot more they do a lot more online checks and it got to the point where it wasn't doable and they started enforcing their one game from a library um per in use at a time policy much more strictly to the point where I would log in to do a quick Benchmark at work and it would kick my son off of Rocket League at home or whatever the
case may be and it kind of sucks because it used to be you bought your whole library of games and anyone could play them as long as you weren't both playing the same game at the same time then you know no harm no foul right um well guess what valve is taking it back to that so they've launched steam families on the steam beta client which is a collection of new and existing family related features to replace both steam family sharing and steam family view a steam family can consist of up to six members
and everyone in the steam family gets access to any family sharing compatible games in their other family members libraries now so instead of only being able to play one game from a library at a time across the entire family users can now play different games at the same time that's freaking awesome yeah adults consent parental controls ring playtime limits allowing access to appropriate games and more and a child account now has the ability to request for an adult to pay for their shopping cart making it
way easier for parents to purchase games for their kids and as a parent way more importantly making it way easier for kids to not purchase games on their own because in the past you basically had to choose between the inconvenience of having to go down and enter your credit card information every time or the risk of your kids going and buying stuff with a saved credit card in their account now I do see a downside to this as a developer how do I feel about my games being eligible for Family
Sharing now that Family Sharing is so much more convenient and so much more powerful like Family Sharing was basically so kneecapped that I essentially didn't use it I ended up buying multiple copies of games just so that I wouldn't have to worry about interrupting my kids while they're playing when I want to play or when I want to Benchmark something or whatever the case may be as it is now it seems like um a lot fewer people will have to do that and as their own independent living
breathing organisms you know should my kids be entitled or my roommates or my friends or whoever my family is should they be entitled to play these games they didn't buy um will I be less likely to make my game eligible for Family Sharing under this system what would you how would you feel yeah I don't know I'm I'm reading through the FAQ right now because I'm trying to get a Vibe for like how a family unit could be formed because one thing that I'm worried about if I'm a developer um is the you know uh a
closeit group of six friends at school form a family um and share one steam account among all of them and and and polyes are totally okay I'm not judging "sure y there's like 32,000 in the" Seattle one and it's growing every day um it's not sustainable so yeah I don't know it doesn't sound like there's any limitations to like Under One Roof or anything like that um I I'm actually not really finding pretty much any limitations at all um they they do say that the the terms of how they
Define a family is subject to change so maybe they'll figure that out over time um there's also some interesting stuff if if you leave a steam family um you will need to wait one year from when you from when you joined the previous one oh that's not that big of a deal oh interesting so you can't just like float around from family to family no but one year from your join date of the previous one not your exit date so if you if you okay well that that kind of makes sense that could be a
zero day difference if you're at above a year um yeah as long as you as long as you don't um well basically it says that you don't have to mourn your old family for a year yeah as long as you were with them for at least a year yeah which might be good for some people you know things happen in in family units um it's just I don't know I would want to enable this but it is definitely a scenario where I I guarantee you people are going to misuse it now honestly in most situations at work
man our Benchmark accounts we're only going to have to have a couple of copies of every game spread out across all of our Benchmark accounts which going to make way more effective for us to use those Benchmark accounts are in a family dude they're all yeah it's clearly not a family though so like yeah there there's definitely uses for this that are not going to be family now I yeah honestly I think that there's nothing wrong with that um us basically not having to buy like five copies of every stupid game
just so that we can run them for 20 minutes every week to Ben or whatever if it is that friend group from school I used to share games with my friends You' trade games all the time temporarily like oh I have this snst game you have this N64 game we both have both consoles for some reason I don't know why I made this analogy this weird but you can borrow this one I'll borrow that one and we'll trade back in a week or two whatever that was was tot very normal um I understand that making it all digital
and making giving it the ease of use of something like steam is going to massively increase the amount of that trading that happens but you are sort of locked into this family unit for a year at a time so it's not like you're jumping all over the place based on what game you want to play um so I don't know I hope it goes okay because this seems like a really cool thing um and honestly the main way that I would potentially use it is to like encourage people to pick up a game themselves um like here
look you can borrow this for a bit I've definitely never lent anyone my Origin account so that they could try out Titanfall 2 and then convince them to just buy it for themselves afterwards um that's definitely never a thing that I've done by the way neither of us is recommending ever doing do not lend out your game accounts yeah um but it's just like yeah I don't know I think I would be okay with it I think I would turn it on yeah I think it's pretty cool I think it's good I I'm a
little bit worried about how this might go but I really hope it goes well because I think it's overall a very good thing yeah and I think honestly it might encourage the sales of say that of everything okay there are definitely things that are not going to be universally regarded as good things and I think it's time for us to to shift our conversation to the smos song that they released uh I think it was earlier this week or last week called submissive and breedable a collaboration with BB no
money um that has it's baby no money don't say BB no money come on H do I do I have any idea who this is H he's good I like his music genuinely come on now okay so the point is um the official music video uh Luke do you want to pull it up yeah sure if you guys want to all go to the same time stamp uh so maybe maybe head to about 1:30 1 1:30 yep and then you guys can if everyone heads over there if you could here I'll I'll I'll drop this in the chat I'll drop the link to the uh you
guys we can all watch together that's how we're going to do this so that they get their views okay so I'm dropping this in all the chats oh my God it brings up twitch chat rules for my own account okay so guys just just head on over there so Luke's not going to screen share Luke you haven't started watching yet right no am I gonna be playing audio off my computer all gonna you you're gonna have to listen otherwise you're not going to be able to hear it okay um but you're just going to

figured it out nice yeah look those birdie Bots every flavor beans are not uh some of them are not good aha success in case you were wondering they truly are every flavor I presume okay they truly truly are are we ready oh that was gross okay hit    so how do you how do you feel about your name being attached to a song of that type and name Kino equality out of 10 five out of seven perfect score can I just can I just say does it help that you don't have a beard anymore usually a
problem it isn't usually a problem that um you know lonus is slang for penis I mean there's so many names that are slaying for penis you know Peter Johnson uh dick right like it's it's not really a that one's a little on point yeah okay you know yeah I just mean it it doesn't really come up that much technically it's a slang but nobody really uses it um as for the whole like tip thing and Tech tips and and and Linus um this is actually the second time this has happened I don't know if you
remember that the previous song yeah yeah yeah so so the the previous song to kind of make this a thing uh is from the mom boys here we go yeah and I guess what I'm trying to say is I've kind of enjoyed that while lonus is technically slaying for penis nobody really uses it and now that it's happened twice it feels dangerously close to becoming a thing um yeah yeah yeah I can't I can't really say that it's my preference I don't think people are really using it that way I think
they're just riffing off of tip I just to be honest I think you're reading artistic expression tip and and lus is is a good cultural reference I would agus meaning penis I don't think anyone's doing that to be honest I want I want I want BB merch now that just says like just the tips I'm going to wear it around work if if baby no money releases merch that that's it less is submissive and breedable I'm not saying I am not wearing anything else oh my gosh I mean you should see my
computer backgrounds to start with like gez yeah yeah yeah I don't know how do how do you feel about that did they reach out to you or did they just do it you don't you don't have to out based yeah they don't they don't need to reach out that's they're they're on they're on base as far as that goes uh like I'm not I'm not saying this is not well within their rights to do I'm just saying it's you know no no I was just wondering I'm not yeah are are you not flattered I would be flattered I think it's very
flattering I um you're you're culturally relevant enough to uh to be a clever simile in a in a in a piece of artistic work that people will understand too yes like that's that's huge yeah you know like uh you can make references to Napoleon for you know other things or other ideas right SM myad yeah uh and you're there you're there I'm not likening you to Napoleon that was an   go what he's short and in another country so he's Napoleon yeah there you go where does where does Napoleon put
his armies up his sleevies LTT store.com yeah oh my goodness wow so um honestly my first reaction to this was that I just have no idea uh what to make of it um that seems I've uh I've I've met um you know I've met the smash guys I uh I think they're super cool I um have a lot of respect for them they're pioneers you know and that's that's sort of separate right like you can think someone's super cool um or like cool or whatever um but you know know things about them and you're like oh yeah I
don't respect them these guys I I I think they're super cool and I respect them a lot um absolute Builders of this space which is really cool I'm so happy to see that they're you know back together got their Channel back that this is you know one of the outcomes of that was not something that I had on my  yeah that's pretty funny uh um seeing that uh other great creators are making music uh Christmas album too win oh my god um smash the halls with something something yeah sex sexy Christmas
album searching for the Claris I guess like I don't know these These lyrics though dude like a Lenovo think pad oh man uh okay so anywh who um I don't I don't know what else to say about this I I really I don't I don't know if I fully got an answer to like how do you feel about uh it it being this title and subject matter of a song that your name was in not not like oh people are using my name for for I mean more that it's it's submissive and breedable specifically that you're referenced in
does that bother you at all or just it doesn't matter really matters yeah I know okay yeah no I don't think that really matters I mean art is uh art is Art I uh I'm not really I'm not really going to go in and sort of question someone else's voice and someone else's someone else's art I mean they're obviously not um they they're they're they're not um it's it's not slanderous or defamatory in any way they're not like it at all yeah yeah it's it's nothing to do with anything other than just
like whatever Tekken on my tip first thing like lius means first thing maybe this is just one of those things where um I just don't understand it because it's some kind of slang that I am too M I think it's more they were if I have to assume it's cuz they were searching for something to rhyme with feral boy Friday she the lion yeah yeah that line is really good after  maybe I don't know I don't know maybe either way I think that's a good take on it cuz like it doesn't at all seem like
anything was nefarious here it's just supposed to be a funny song I I think some people would be like I'm I'm not that I don't want to be included in this um and that's just yeah whatever I don't know it's a fair enough take but is kind of boring and I prefer just not caring and Zer Point says I don't like the rhyme of lius with lioness um the reason you don't like that is not uh subjective uh it's objective those things do not rhyme uh but some artistic license was taken and Prett
common does not rhyme that is super commed in music people will pronounce they'll change even how they say words to make them sound like they flow together so yeah I I wouldn't that's a I drive a Chevrolet movie theater interior crocodile alligator Mr Mr Bigg Biggy Smalls everyone yeah yeah it's it's classic it's lovely yeah yeah speaking of uh things that are Lov you know that's hilarious by the way Luke thought that was what the word was yeah until not that long ago I think yeah yeah yeah
yeah Minaj that would I think a lot of people think that that would be I think a ton of people think that to be honest I think biggie was an extremely influential person okay it's unlimited right unlimited he defines language okay you guys you guys have never done art  you okay uh speaking of things that are cool first human to receive neuralink this is actually uh pretty cool hopefully it doesn't go from here 29-year-old Nolan arbau a quadriplegic says that the brain implant has allowed
him to play chess and civilization on his PC using his freaking mind he's quoted saying I'm so freaking lucky to be a part of this the implant works by reading brain signals from the user and translating them into bluetooth-based remote Commands to control an electronic device like a mouse cursor for arbau this is this part was like okay that's pretty cool uh for arbau this initially involved trying to move his hands obviously he can't cuz he's quadriplegic but trying to and even though he's lost
the ability to move them that would translate into most cursor movement which is like no way wild to honestly even really think about from there it just became intuitive for him to start Imagining the cursor moving and basically it was like he was using the force on a curser and he could get it to move wherever he wanted this resulted in an 8 hour straight gaming session on Civ 6 outside of the standard neuralink trials and he just had to quit because the device needed to wirelessly charge
um also he stated that um We've ran into some issues I don't want people to think this is the end of the journey there's still a lot of work to be done but it has already changed my life so so far um that's really cool for people who might be struggling with something like uh being a quadriplegic being able to be enabled to have more things to do be able to play chess be able to play Civ that's fantastic super cool I think that's great really really cool hopefully like I said
earlier it doesn't go bad um uh but yeah wanted to share some good news what else do we got glass expensable menu items oh this is old this is great after last last week's tax write-off sale community members on the LT Forum pointed out that there was a restaurant in Toronto called Good Fortune that had a campaign where they renamed their menu items after office supplies so that office workers could expense them uh Luke do you want to screen share that for the kind folks out
there yeah um we've got the um Diamond chicken burger aka the mini dry erase whiteboard we've got the uh double your fortune Burger renamed the ergonomic aluminum laptop stand the emerald veggie burger renamed the wired earphones with mic and their french fries Palm fries uh or Palm fries renamed USB Wired Mouse I like the our discussion our discussion question my favorite one is the a little cheap for damn this delay though our discussion question is isn't 1250 a little cheap for an aluminum laptop
stand uh it depends if it's for Apple yes yeah that's fair yeah I thought it was pretty funny it is it is I think it's been reposted because this this was happened a long time ago I think um yeah it was a long time ago yeah okay okay sounds good it was a it was a short-term promo I mean should we do it on the store anyone wanna anyone want to write off some LTT merch this the funny part is fraud it's some amount of LTT merch would be like you have screwdrivers Cable Management tools
thermal paste like a lot of it would be fine it just is already okay backpack a business that needed that could potentially okay I I don't know a lot of it might be fine uh what else we got I don't think we have much I think we're mostly through it um oh but we haven't talked talked about the Apex Legends hack oh and we have some announcements and there's some other things going on we got stuff I just had to scroll up to find it uh I'll do this one during an official Apex
Legends tournament last weekend at least two professional players were allegedly hacked midgame leading to the final of the Apex Legends Global series being postponed in two separate matches Imperial how or sorry yeah Imperial Hall was given an Aimbot and gen Burton was suddenly able to see the location and health of everyone else in the round the cheat menu was opened on gurton's screen contained a joke option of vote Putin and a message was sent via his in-game chat which read Apex ha hacking Global
series by Destroyer 2009 and random the anti-che police department a a volunteer run group that gathers Intelligence on cheats and cheat vendors wow I didn't know this was a thing issued a statement saying that there was a remote code EX excution exploit present in either the game itself or an easy anti-che easy anti-che however denied that there was any remote code execution vulnerability within their system in their first tweet in 5 years Destroyer 2009 uh the hacker taking responsibility for the incident
has since spoken to Tech Crunch and said that the hack was mostly just for fun but also to force respawn to fix the vulnerability he used to hack them EA doesn't have a bug Bounty program uh he didn't say exactly how he you uh how he hacked the matches beyond that it had nothing to do with the server and it never went outside the game and didn't involve infecting either players rig or malware Destroyer 2009 apparently with malware with malware sorry Destroyer 2009 apparently has a reputation for
hacking high-profile players for the LOLs as for why he specifically targeted gin Burton and Imperial how Destroyer 2009 said that they're just nice guys who deserve free attention and views discussion question is this a problem specific to Apex Legends why aren't games like this more secure I mean the reason I wanted to talk about this this week was because you've been kind of going off on the state of online gaming and how utterly broken it is we talked last week about a
hypothetical peripheral that basically was watching everything you did in real time to ensure that absolutely nothing that happened on screen had any disconnect from what your hands were in person um something like this the ability of a hacker to force another player to cheat I think shows a how sophisticated this software is getting how sophisticated these um these players are getting and B how utterly unsalvageable online gaming is um I just don't really know what else to
say at this point I I think like I've talked at length about why I you know I had to find a way I had to find a way and I got it I got my way but I've talked at length about how games like Ballers Gate 3 and uh hell divers and other like more recent kind of Co-op or even single player focused games there's a fantastic very well-working Co-op mod for Elden ring but Elden ring is more a single player game um Elden ring popped off a lot of these non-online competitive games have been doing very
well lately and I think in no small part it's because hacking in competitive games has gotten to a ridiculous Point um and I don't I don't know if it's because companies aren't investing enough or if it's just a losing battle no matter what they do or what it is but the percentages of cheaters in games is crazy the amount of streamers that get caught all the time cheating is wild because if the cheaters are or if streamers are getting caught cheating you know there's a lot more cuz it's a
lot easier when you're not on stream um so it's just it's it's frustrating and it it ruins things because the the biggest problem which we've also talked about is it brings to to doubt every other loss or death or whatever it is that you have in a game even if that person isn't cheating it's like well were they did I actually lose because of a skill Gap did I actually lose because of a lack of preparation whatever else or did I lose just cuz this person person's cheating which
really sour the whole experience I think a lot of people out there are okay with you know not being good enough to win all the time but don't really feel super okay with losing because you know the other person might have actually been worse but they installed something and now they win anyways um so it's it's it's rough I know a lot of people personally that have kind of stopped really playing that many online competitive games especially online competitive Shooters I even know people
that have traditionally not really been interested in anything other than online competitive shooters that have started shifting to things like leagal Legends of all games because yes you can cheat in League of Legends really yeah but it's a lot less impactful than cheating in something like say war zone or or valerant or Call of Duty or um or Counter-Strike or something like that um so yeah it is what it is but this sucks this sucks a lot there's a merch message here that I want to jump to real quick 
topic uh from Brandon G Luke laran announced today that balers gate will not be getting any major DLC as someone who hasn't played yet this gets rid of a barrier to entry for me but how does it feel for a long-term player yeah I'll speak to that um I've actually reached out to them about this already uh I am sad strong disagree very angry no actually I'm I'm sad because I really like the characters I really like the story and there's honestly a lot of ways that I could see it going that I think
would be fantastic that team is amazing from from bottom to the top as far as I can tell so I think they would make a very good DLC but if you read the article more the reason that they give for doing so is because they didn't think their hearts were in it apparently there was communication before bg3 was released about other projects that they could work on that were not bg3 and the the team was excited to work on those and when bg3 was this like incredible Smash Hit success the natural stepping
for a gaming company is to make DLC or additional content of some kind through expansions or whatever else so they can continue to monetize that game that is what you naturally do so laran stepped into that normal thing that you do but their hearts weren't really in it they were excited to work on this other thing and the the CEO of of laran Sven Vicki I hope I pronounced his name correctly um just decided like you know what no we're going to do the thing that we really want to do which is this next project
that they're not announcing um and you know what I have some sadness for not receiving DLC for this game that's fantastic but I have more excitement for the next thing that they end up doing so as far as I'm concerned it's the right move I think that's good if they if they're if a well funded a well funded next thing yeah exactly right like whatever um so yeah I don't know I think that's uh I think that's good I also think the next thing that they're doing is not specifically D and there's been
some talks about that as well uh which might be a good move their previous game uh original sin 2 as far as my understanding goes is not based on any of that and it's fantastic um I I I don't think they need to be attached to D and D at all personally I don't think that's required in the slightest I think they have no issue creating worlds creating interesting story lines creating interesting character bases all that type of stuff I think they'll be completely fine doing that um so yeah
I'm excited for whatever they do next and the motivations behind this move make me excited for the fact that they did this move despite the fact that I'm still sad that I don't get DLC so yeah I think it's good I'm also happy I'll say this that they're not farming the D out to some other company who's going to screw it up uh because we we see stuff like that happen as well um so they didn't they didn't talk about this stain on the legacy of this game yes they they didn't talk about doing this because I
don't think it ever even came to mind necessarily but there are absolutely companies that have done that and would do that and they're not doing that as far as I can tell so that's great because I would rather it doesn't get touched than it gets ruined so yeah I'm  all right are there any other topics we want to get through real quick here I feel like um the Canadia ban on flipper zero update could probably use a little bit of discussion uh the makers of The Flipper Zero have published an official
response to the Canadian government's proposed ban on both the zero and similar devices as a way of reducing audio theft um but here's the thing a primary argument against Banning The Flipper zero is the fact oh okay yeah here's the thing The Flipper zero lacks the hardware necessary to replicate a keyless fob in order to gain entry into a car car thieves can use a keyless repeater system to pick up the signal of a keyless fob near the entrance of a home and transmit it to a nearby car but
the equipment needed to pull this off is quite a bit larger taking up the space of a backpack and far more expensive about "$6,000 online The Flipper zero can" capture and replicate the code from a remote control but can't replicate the kind of in code used by car fobs The Flipper zero creators further argue that many security systems are currently relying on security through obscurity I.E relying on most people simply not knowing enough about the system to exploit its flaws which is one of the
reasons that the flipper zero exists needless to say I agree um with flipper and uh the Canadian government is being big dumb um also EVGA who traditionally has been in the news for being super cool is in the news for something not  Uris whatever was recently crossposted to the LTT subreddit the user bought a new EVGA GQ 1000 watt gold power supply however it was defective which isn't necessarily a problem stuff happens but he sent it back to EVGA who told the user hey hold on to the cables and
accessories that came with the unit and just send back the power supply when they received their new unit they connected their old cables and the PC failed to start and there was a click possibly indicating that an overload protection circuit had been triggered they immediately rechecked the cables which were the correct EV they were EVGA cables but after some troubleshooting they checked the voltages of their St of Power with a multimeter and found that it was way off 12vt instead of 3vt and Z
volts instead of 5 volts Etc upon the issue being reported to EVGA customer service was able to determine the problem within a matter of minutes at some point the pin layout of that power supply was changed this incident destroyed 22 terabytes of SATA drives and this is where things get really bad because all of this is bad but this is where things get really bad support has suggested to the user that they seek a warranty replacement from the manufacturer of the hard drives rather than EVGA
compensating them for the drives in order to replace  me so EVGA is basically suggesting to the user that they do a little they do a little fraud on their hard drive manufacturer instead of EVGA ponying up  mistake thiss that's really bad it's interesting because what I think they should do it I don't know why it says SATA drives because like what you expecting there to be IDE drives like what well because it was the SATA connector that the uh that the voltages were screwed up on yeah but
what I'm saying is I can't tell if this is hard diser ssds there a drastic difference in cost doesn't matter just yeah well I'm at 22 terabytes I'm assuming they're hard drives yeah um that that shouldn't even be if it's hard drives I mean if it's either of them you just kind of have to stomach it it gets weird because if you're not the manufacturer of the drives how are you verifying that this is at all what happened but at that point like you screwed up so bad you just got to deal with it I
think this sucks a lot because I one of the big reasons why I used to like EVGA so much was because their customer service was so good to me but that was also over a decade ago so I don't know it is what it is stuff like this makes me feel like evj is uh not the company that they used to be I I had never heard of them doing anything like this in the past not at all ever I've I've given away stories of how good of customer service they had a million times I've never heard anyone counter it and then
this is like this is rough let's talk uh let's talk announcements float plane spring break want to talk us through what that is yeah we've got something special coming for our float plane members from next Monday March 25th through March 29th we're releasing extra special float plane exclusives as part of what we're calling float plane spring break it's also because we just made too many exclusives for the month which is a fun problem to have uh we'll also be doing some giveaways including a set of

time my name is Luke that's not we got one person from each department to do a paper airplane battle to see who can do the best design who can make it the fastest and who can throw it the farthest hi uh my name is Luke laf that's not how you pronounce it I'm the COO of float plane and the CTO for lus Media Group that's not even accurate throw it they didn't listen to me hold  CEO got him do we not have ECC my RoR screwed up so like by default I'm going to do back so as a side objective I'm
going to bring you random fact about Canada that progressively get more deranged over time and I'm going to start with that Winnie Poo is based off of a the PO Canada wait really yeah which bear just a bear that was in a zoo I think I don't know a bear Nam what's also crazy Winnie yeah is that Canada was in a war a notable some which be it's like we were at war with Denmark until 2022 it's called The Whiskey War the reason why it was called The Whiskey war going there planting their
respective flag Canada would leave whiskey and Denmark would leave schnaps and they did that for like 50 years and then sadly it ended in 2022 sadly well that was the coolest thing ever and then they were like nah as long as I don't step over the crack yeah so I could take a running start you take a running start yeah no I just want to see what it's going to do oh my God okay that's not good that's terrible wait no I think that's over here hold on dud you would you say that's not over the crack just for you
I'll let it pass okay okay and then oh my god dude that's the worst airplane design what are you even doing it's  foot wow I'm going to the Z drive right now anyways anyway anyways I didn't spend any time even Googling how to fold a paper airplane and I haven't made one in like 15 16 years uh so I just Googled Canada facts and then tried to bring entertainment to the video that way lonus I tried to make the video more entertaining lus do you not do you not Mentor Luke not anymore man no we don't we
don't actually work together other than wano that's it yeah uh yeah pretty much other things uh merch updates yeah retro screwdriver free shipping is still going deal ends March 29th so you've got till the pretty much the end of next week um and I think we just announced that yeah you can buy those key caps so that's all the announcements we have to get through I believe yeah are we good then is that it   lights um no I'll just be I'll just be a weird bright spot okay yeah fine I'll get it
no no no no no no I my webcam no that was that I meant my lights here not yours I can just a joke I can D you artificially my webcam uh compensates so much for Darkness I probably different uh yeah see like that did nothing no that's okay I make me grainier please please come back I'm gonna bring the light back then and then you can dim me all right whatever that works should IAT another birdie Bots every flavor Bean yes okay wait wait wait wait wait yes do that but I really hope I don't get
ashtray this time before before we go into merch messages you got to tell us about your trip how's Japan you've been there for a bit now oh boy well the birie bot's every flavored beans have uh not gone well so far have any of good CU there is supposed to be good ones right isn't there oh god um oh oh I feel like I feel nauseous need some water um that is truly an unpleasant experience I can guarantee you that if you just drink soy sauce the flavor will of the the bean will go away oh Mommy
Bean thank you for that um oh that was  recommended yeah no but seriously how's how's Japan been um this getting been I got to tick I got to tick off my bucket list uh last night uh getting to experience being shoved into a packed Japanese train ah nice so that's um good that's a thing that happened I felt really bad for the guy um across the train from where I was standing because I had our stroller in front of me with two children in it and whoever was jamming from the door could
not see that there was a stroller that was like digging into this guy's knee um and they were just they were packing he had nowhere to go and I was just I looked at him I'm just like I have no way to prevent this like the the brakes are applied on the stroller but that means nothing at that point yeah like I yeah it was only for a couple of stops but yeah they they actually did the thing where the like platform person came and shoved people into the train like it's real that's wild I don't think I've ever
actually because of the stroller like rolling it must have felt like there was a bit of give in it or something because they kept giving her was pretty rough dude I felt really bad for the "guy it's not over 9,000 is saying uh oh" he's talking about the other stuff yeah um yeah how how okay so how is Japan and so far you said you got shoved onto a train what else have you done what have you enjoyed what are good things tell me about it and you often don't like traveling so I'm trying to dig for like
has anything good happened have you enjoyed your trip um Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios is one of the most elaborate beautiful outstanding construction projects I think I've ever seen um cool it was it was crafted with a level of of of care and love that I just uh think I rarely encountered the entire place is a complete work of art uh there's like two rides one of which is for very very small children um and a bunch of just like places to buy merch in fact I'd say Universal Studios in
Japan in general um has some sort of incongruity I guess is how I would describe it like um you know it's it's it's a bit of a cultural it's not even apparently rude it just like isn't done to to drink a beverage while you're walking around so why do you need vending machines with beverages everywhere you know like that um everything comes so over packaged but there's no garbage cans um they every people people live in I'm I'm in an apartment right now people live in apartments where as far as I can
tell there is absolutely no space to store things but so many of the experiences that you have are to just buy random like I I'm just having a really hard time I'm having a really hard time meshing these things together like Universal Studios Japan even compared to a Disney park um so I've been to Disneyland I've been to Disney World so much of what's there is not rides it's like just stuff to buy um and that's a really bad thing about the Disney parks but it just feels it feels even more like that here
um and so yeah so I'm just I'm I'm struggling a little bit uh it's it's it's known for its food in in a big way um but I would say that compared to compared to Taiwan I cannot rely on just kind of any random hole in the wall just being awesome uh there's much like more like home more like home there's a there's a huge disparity between good food and like really bad food like there's stuff here that's just really gross like really awful just objectively terrible um I I I find it very I find it
very and I find there are there are experiences that are quite hyped here that are sort of disconnected from that sort of cultural value of food like the Pokemon cafe is rated I think four and a half Stars Pokemon cafe uh Tokyo we managed to get a reservation after h four nights in a row of either me or Ivonne or both of us staying up till 2 in the morning to be there the second that they that they open up uh reservations each oh we could have like made something for you make
e um well look if I was willing to bot I would never admit to it okay doesn't matter the point is it was it was very difficult to get a reservation we did get a reservation here um Pokemon cafe oh for crying out loud how do I just find this on no I have to go to Google Maps and then I have to search for it because sure that makes sense I think it's four and a half Stars though I think it's rated four and a half Stars so we we got we got our reservation and I got to say
um it was terrible 4.3 Stars uh the food was largely inedible um the drink that I got was uh like a milk I I just I got a milk tea I was like they can't possibly screw this up except probably about the top third of it was that fake fake whipped cream like the petroleum byproduct that's yeah that's not worth even having all yeah I'd rather go it it was disgusting I couldn't drink it um so I thought I thought I had been to Pokemon cafe so I think V might have asked me something
about it but now in Googling I had gone to Pikachu sweets by Pokemon cafe not Pokemon cafe okay I thought they were the same thing Pokemon cafe is basically terrible the Pokemon cafe is basically terrible terrible food um you kind of rushed in and rushed out uh there's an opportunity to buy merch um it's definitely cute like this like the the the Pikachu shaped rice is cute but like little things were just awful like the um the the the the not the nacho chip that is Pikachu's tail the like
um uh the kind of toasted nacho chip that is Pikachu's tail in the rice dish it was stale all of them were stale uh we had we had a couple of them at our table uh they were stale um we went to the pom pom purin Cafe not even really knowing what that is it's like some Hello Kitty character but it was you know seemed cute that was the first one we went to so we didn't know that these themed cafes are just terrible terrible food yeah and Decor that is themed after some character um
so it's just it's really weird to see how much you can pay for really really awful food somewhere where supposedly like food culture is a huge thing so I guess food culture is a huge thing unless you put kind of a cute skin on it and then it doesn't matter it could be actual garbage just shoveled onto a plate as  um so that's so so back to my question confusing to me what's been good getting getting to enjoy a traveling vacation is hard people are like these are classic
tourist traps guys they were mostly full of people speaking Japanese there was there was almost the Pokémon Cafe I'd say was the most touristy one but like the pom pom pan Cafe was full of Japanese people um and maybe they were they maybe were there from another part of Japan like you can there's such a thing as domestic tourism that's totally a thing but um yeah objectively bad um we did this like ninja experience Cafe that was really fun for the kids I'd say this overall had a good time I
um I have serious reservations about some of the animal cafes we've done like we did an owl Cafe where you get to like hold an owl perched on your arm there were a lot of Ls in there um you know was it a fun experience for the kids a great photo op absolutely um do I feel good having supported that particular business practice honestly not  uh thinking um trying to think yeah we went to a cat cafe where the cats honestly didn't seem like mistreated in any way but they were
bored as heck like they were they were they were checked out they were not down to playay or interact or anything so I just left them alone which seems to be what they wanted I mean that's probably if I was a little cat in a cat cafe that's probably what I would want okay what's been good has good there's here's here's another major disconnect in Japan and is this is a super sort of high-tech high-tech Society right um You can get almost anything through automation like uh we
we did one of those conveyor belt sushi places um so you just order everything by iPad and it just whips along a conveyor belt to your to your table and you just kind of dump your dirty plates down the thing uh totally amazing and then we went to ride the bullet train and we bought our ticket at the terminal and uh we got some food and we ate and then we went to go onto the platform and to scan our ticket and they're like oh no no you you need the basic fair and your ticket and I'm like what mean I
need my Basir I have my weird I have my passo it says I need it says I need a pasmo here's my pasmo so I tried to scan my pasmo and here's my ticket they're like uh uh uh uh no you need a basic fair and I'm like okay so like at the machine no no you cannot buy the basic fair at the same machine where you buy your bullet train ticket sucked for the place you you have to go and line so we missed our train that we had that we had scheduled for and like they they took care of it
but as I was standing in the line as I was standing in the line to talk to an agent in order to get the the the half of the ticket that I needed all of these these agents working at the speed of light trying to get these people processed I'm sitting here going why was any of this necessary how about I just tell you where I am and where I'm trying to go to and you just tell me how much that costs and you print the ticket why are there two tickets so the way it works is you get
two tickets and you slide both tickets into the machine at the same time and you can you can load your pass but instead of just being money the the way that the the the P you have to specifically load the basic fair at the counter onto your pasmo card and it's like why really though why I bought my seat reservation and I have money what difference does it make and why can this not be done at the same automatic terminal that I bought my seat reservation at it makes absolutely
no sense and so just the the the the lengths that some Japanese organizations and businesses and individuals will go to automate and make things high tech and then you'll turn around and something will be done in a manual way for no possible explainable reason it's just such a such a bizarre disconnect to me like the amount of micromanagement of lines at the theme park we went to um oh my god oh oh Universal Studios okay this is amazing so we bought the express Ticket and as
you go into the express line they will have you um they will have you bring up your Express ticket but they don't have a scanner for it they don't have a scanner for the QR code um so what they want you to do is bring up the ticket on your phone and and zoom in on it a zoom in on it so they can read and make sure you have an Express ticket for that ride then so that takes a while because they check that for every individual in your party so we had seven people so they have someone standing at the entry
to the express lineup manually reading your ticket like with with their eyes reading it there's QR codes all over it there's four QR codes one on every corner never mind that a single larger QR code might have worked a little bit better whatever okay then you make your way into the line and before you get on the ride at some point in the line someone comes along with a scanner and scans your QR code why why did both of those checkpoints exist there's nowhere for you to get out
of that line it could have easily been at the very beginning of that line that they could have done that or they could just not bother and they could let you stand in the line and then they could check it there or or they could have a system where their backend sees that you've scanned it once at that that one and then scanned it again at the other thing or whatever there's absolutely no reason for someone with their human eyes to be reading text on a thing on my phone when I could have scanned a QR
code when there was no way for me to activate any of this without my phone and without the QR code with it's the exact same ticket that has the QR code on it that has the text they're reading you guys ever wonder how he got into  um okay so okay so so far we're 0 for three uh what's a what's a good what's a good thing what's something you've enjoyed have you gone to the thing I recommended yet so you've enjoyed that the kids having having a lot of fun um we went to the art installation it was
pretty cool um ah I got a pretty cool that's honestly I I was I I thought you would either come out and try to Flame me for it cuz you hated it and I was going to have to uh fight you um or you were going to do that I knew you weren't going to be like it was awesome but I I'll I'll count that as a win he thought it was pretty cool you've heard everything so far Super Mario I I was positive on Super Nintendo World they had but you said it's a it's  experience it's just to sell you stuff
it's incredible Bowser Castle I honestly I would have still I would have still gone in just to walk through the castle that has the Mario Kart right that's cool that's cool I it it is it is beautifully crafted every square inch of it has had more care put into it than most you know grade 10 students would put into a homework assignment they have to hand in like it's it's absolutely unbelievable um I also couldn't I was blown away the I'm just saying this just the level of care and attention grade 10 school
homework though really might not get a lot of care I'm saying per square inch though per square inch Luke okay okay all right per square inch yeah yeah um I I've been I've been kind of Blown Away by the sort of the enthusiasm of just you know the average that part isol what motivating factors are there it has a bit of a step wives like if I don't keep this job I'm going to die kind of vibe to it but um I didn't get that I definitely appreciate being goed upon I it to me it just felt
like people were proud of their work regardless of what their work was that's the vibe that I got I bet there's some of that yeah which is good uh okay so kids are having a good time Super Nintendo L was a the trains impressive experience other than some like small stupid things like trying to catch the O Loop line from um uh I don't know whatever whatever major station we were at there inexplicably there's just no signs for it um and then there's another line that uses the same color code that is not the
o line okay so the reason why I laugh so hard at that is because I I guarantee you I know exactly where you were standing when you got really frustrated about the o line because I stood there for a couple minutes ranting to my brother about how the signage is so good the whole time and then you get to this one spot with all these pillars is is that where you were maybe I don't know we might have been at a different station there's all these pillars and the signs just get
screwed up and it's there's no way to really tell and then you have to walk a little bit with no guidance and then you can find your way to the o line properly again and then yeah there's two lines with the same color I ended up figuring out the same color thing is because there's two companies that run the trains sure so so it's not really that it gets which gets kind of weird but yeah that's funny that you had those two complaints cuz I ran into exactly those two things but yeah the more local
trains are are pretty easy once you start getting it um but yeah the the two tickets for the the highspeed bullet trains is wacky yeah AJ same oh yeah that's the one uh yeah yeah was that shin oaka and it was just like this is I just got to a complete dead end of signage and I'm like K yeah it's weird it's weird we just had to wander around and find it if you add like one to two signs it would solve the whole problem which is so odd apparently AJ ran into the same problems
to signs that and there were signs that just should have obviously indicated where to go you know where they could have just had another line right there that's like yeah if you're trying to get to the to the loop line here's all the other ones but the right direction catching the loop line in the right direction threw us for a loop last night because you can't just say hold on they you can't just say it goes to this station because there's no Terminus station so figuring out the direction is
kind of tough because both ways technically go everywhere and instead of them just saying what the next one it goes to is they pick a couple of major ones along the line uh so we almost got on the wrong uh train going the wrong way it was a whole thing we we made it  okay well how much longer are you there for uh a couple more days but like look I mean travel is not really my thing I I also don't like seafood um which is sort of a drag in Japan um that's fair you know my kids
are into it so I can't just go for Kobe every night um you know get that Wu would you do you like wagu I'm not I'm not into it personally I like meteor Meats yeah fine I don't know um I it's fine I'm just I'm happy that you at least had some experiences that you liked because I know you don't really like traveling and you enjoying something that isn't like uh you know putting a box somewhere and plugging cables into it is good look we're we're we're here for the kids and they are
having a really good time and that that's good that's got value what's uh what's like what's we have lost your voice yeah when your voice comes back what's little  far okay well if this is potentially going to take a bit to get his voice back maybe if we can find a merch message for me while he works on that and keep the show flowing sure I can do that let me just move my monitor over  um let's just technical difficulties can Luke reply to this yeah uh what's up hey how's it going uh I have found that in
in ano uh in baa is really complicated because of the irrigation systems and I'm working on uh you know increasing the efficiencies of my water runs there you go SK issue I have I have yes I up and yeah lus is was really hard there's my there's I bought it when it was on sale when when lonus said and I'm I was like okay I can't play this game no 1800 I'm never going to stop yeah lonus and I played and I had forgotten We we played recently and I had forgotten kind of a lot of the basics of
the game but also realized like all the things that I did when we played were really simple atlan was doing all the hard stuff so I want to skill up so I started playing single player and I was like holy crap U but I've gotten a lot better which is good oh really yeah that's pretty funny I know like trade routes now I've done like multi-point trade routes and like all this other stuff so like yeah I I will be better now I've actually gotten way more into by doing that is every time you um every
time you build a world you will reach a new level of citizens and you're going to be like oh everything I did before was wrong and everything is destroyed now you have you have to plan my many stages in advance the the reason that I was like okay well I'm never going to be able to stop playing this is because the friction for undoing everything that you had already done is like nothing it's pretty low if you play on the easy difficulty it's pretty low yeah it's high on the higher it's way less than
pretty much anything else I've touched which is great yeah I I I had that feeling line it's because I was playing I thought I was like doing pretty well and then I unlocked uh oil and I was just like oh yeah what what do you mean I can't have the train track run on the road I that means I can't get to the harbor cuz all the houses are in the way I yeah that that sucked um but anyways to start over uh okay so you're you're back yeah what was uh what's uh little man's   uh I don't know he's kind of uh he's
kind of enjoyed a lot of stuff I'd have to I'd have to ask um I haven't really done the the post trip what was your favorite thing yet not not actually post trip yet so that makes sense all right fair enough maybe we should just flow into merch messages yeah we should go through them pretty quick though because I think I gotta run pretty quick okay sounds good okay I'll work on potentials um recently started playing through the Halo c campaign with my eldest any proud 
Milestones uh yeah I I curated this one it was uh when when my son beat me at TowerFall not because I'm some kind of expert TowerFall player or because he is either but because it's a pretty pure skill placed game or based game and he like beat me he won he beat Luke too fair and square and multiple times actually yep y yeah wasn't a fluke nope it does have like a strong rubber band built in um but you still have to win it's not like Luke and I benefit from it too you still win
100% because of the doj lawsuit do you see apple ever making an app for airpods for Android like they do with Beats products no but the fact that they exist for Beats products which use the same chip shows you how easily Apple could have it exist they just choose not to hey D I'm too young to remember dog versus Microsoft but how is Microsoft still getting away with aggressively bundling Edge after the ruling that they couldn't bundle Internet Explorer Edge is pretty easy to get
around these days for 20 years also that wake up hello. dll privacy is dead  keep uh privacy dead as someone who wants to keep what little is left of my privacy how did you learn to let go becoming a public figure I didn't really have a choice I um I just I realized that it came with the territory and uh once the tea was or the milk was spilled um it was there's no way to unsp it I so it is what it is there's some stuff like it's a lot easier for me but I definitely have a lot of things that are
not public um but it takes significantly more more to secure them that way yeah unfortun I forgot I did the um I did the go-karting in uh in Tokyo thing oh yeah that didn't interest me I didn't do that did you like that um you were right yeah it oh it's like you're in a car but you're not yeah and you you don't even even remotely um sort of test the limits of the pretty slow kind of boring carts yep you just kind of Drive inform formation um very very carefully uh sounds right
yeah yeah it was uh it was something I mean again massive credit to the people working there they were very enthusiastic and fun and I I I'd say you know what I I realize I sound like kind of a hater so far my highlight is um that one crepe I had the first night at a mall it was so good crepes are apparently a thing here the second one I had made me feel because it had fake whipped cream in it the first one had fake cream and it was it was outstanding or fake cream fresh cream the first one
had Fresh Cream and it was outstanding uh and the people the people are the people are the Highlight for me fantastic yeah everyone's super nice yep it's interesting because they're super nice but also open and like it's relatively clear that they want you here um but for a little bit and then you should go home it's like all right fair enough I like that that's nice they never like say that but the vibe is like fairly clearly communicated they're very happy you're there they're very polite
they're very friendly very good but also it's like there's some amount of like now it's time to leave yeah that was fun thank you yeah yeah which is fine totally fine it's just uh yeah there's no there's no sugar put on it you know there's a there's a saying in England would you like another cup of tea before you leave which is great that's pretty good pretty good it's really effective uh anyway Big L I have no idea who this is for have you found a good Wireless solution for the
valve index I was hoping the noio wireless adapter would be good but it seems to be having postlaunch issues I will be trying that one very soon I've had mine for a few weeks and I have no excuses other than just I have a lot going on for why I haven't tried it yet I'm really looking forward to trying it but to my knowledge that's the only  i d particularly Big L everybody's Big L I almost finished with my teaching degree and always struggling helping students with dyslexia is there anything
you do uh or is anything you do or your teachers did that really helped you love the show uh I don't know how much people are going to like this one of my teachers in particular uh a physics teacher that I had I won't name him just in case he doesn't want who knows times have changed um but he gave us short talk very short talk at one point in time um not to me but I was able to overhear it from another student who had some uh learning disabilities and he was basically the person was basically asking
for uh I think it was like easier marking or something I don't remember exactly what it was and he effectively said no and was like I'm happy to try to give you more attention I'm happy to try to help you but this is how it's going to be once you're out of here so you got to figure it out and whether you have to unfortunately you know study longer or do whatever put in more effort than other people that's just how it's going to be so you should start practicing that now effectively um and I heard the
same thing because I always struggled with reading and was like well okay um so I generally did I've somewhat like brute forced the the reading stuff where I've tried to get a lot better at kind of guessing what the word it is when my brain starts messing it up and you'll see me stumble sometimes it happens on Wow literally every show um so you might notice it uh it happened during the sponsor reads it happened during multiple topics today it happens all the time um I have a
significantly harder time reading text than just speaking and honestly I'm not even that great at just speaking um so yeah I don't know it's it'll be hard but it's not impossible you can figure it out um and keep pushing there are tricks out there you can find fonts um in my experience the fonts are not universal one font that works for one person doesn't work perfectly for another person and vice versa but there's a lot of them so you might be able to find one that works better for you um that's
really the only tool I can suggest to you that won't help you read textbooks that aren't digitized that won't help you um read signs I don't know things like that um but it might help you if you can digitize a textbook or if you can get something into a digital form you might be able to convert the font and read it easier that way uh there's other like speed reading tools that I've found that helped me like one of them only shows one word at a time and it just rapidly flashes through them and
for some reason that works for me um but you won't always be in an environment or a scenario where you can read that way  to find whatever works best for you for me personally learning how to read without those things has been more beneficial um um even though I I do struggle more than if I didn't it's just it's like the same reason why I never went dvorac on my keyboard I never went to vorac on my keyboard despite thinking that it might be better because I'm like well I'm going to have to use other
keyboards and that's going to be super annoying so I'd rather just stay with querty and be used to querty so that when I use other things I'm still in flow and it's still good so I don't know someone said so basically get good yeah kind of it sucks but like this is what it is and instead of just like feeling bad all the time just fight through it you'll be fine you're going to make it you're going to be okay yeah excellent hey D love the podcast I would love to hear your opinion on the
overabundance of scam ads that play in front of almost every video on YouTube now should Google be held liable for any  stolen I do think that platforms should have some responsibility for anything that is an officially sanctioned piece of content that somebody sees I don't know how to enforce that uh but it is pretty clear to me that something needs to be done because it's an enormous problem and it can't be on anyone other than Google to  it let's see what else Hi D lus do you
still use Plex are you considering changing to a competitor and what do you recommend to stream movies in your home I do still use Plex I am strongly considering switching to a competitor I um it's been I think a year and a half since I last communicated with them and told them hey we're not going to do any more promotional activities for you guys until you fix basic functionality that is advertised as part of your product and the basic functionality in question for me was um loading transcoded
versions of my media library onto my device to take with me on the plane in the leadup to this trip I tried across three different Android four four different Android devices to load media and it was an absolute crap show um just errored out trans codes failed downloads across a variety of different versions of Android from new to old to Samsung to not Samsung um it's clear that they basically don't care at all and um just do not respect their users enough to follow through on features
that are supposed to be part of their  um yeah I uh I I don't I don't know what to say other than that their leadership is clearly laser focused on becoming a uh a streaming service for licensed content and uh is treating the users that got them to where they are as second class citizens no this is not a server side config error this is a widespread issue widespread and has been for years years and years and years and years hello from Pax sad you guys aren't here lonus how would you react if you
caught your son cheating in an online game would you differentiate between an  software oh I'd be I'd be mad um I do differentiate between the two for a bit uh in-game exploit versus cheating though yeah cheating very very very bad ingame exploit I'd probably tell them it's rude kind of like how you know in badminton I'll see him flick serve a novice and I'll be like hey that's rude you know don't do that it's not about winning the point it's about playing the game um sometimes don't forget about if
you're playing against someone who's on the same level as you or someone who's better than you by all means employ every possible strategy to win but if you're playing against someone who is already at a significant disadvantage that's fair you don't take shortcuts y  fair my flow plane sub just renewed so happy one year since the hacking for Luke I'm a new tech manager how do you keep oh boy now it's everywhere how do you keep a fully remote team engaged and motivated what helps you help them to be
successful uh it's actually genuinely tough I think what helps it is honestly not necessarily um me or maybe it's me in the hiring process but a lot of the people on the team are just motivated people and honestly uh this might suck for the remote work crowd because I've been a I've been a I've been a public you know Pro on that side but not everyone can do it um the people that I have in general I think can there's been blips here there but there's blips here and there with
every form of employment so I don't think it's been any worse than any local working um I've seen intrinsic motivation drop with people who work in office as well but a bunch of people would not be able to stay on task stay focused stay productive etc etc etc with remote work some people can my teams can and have proven that they can multiple times so I'm happy with that but some people might just not be built for it and that isn't necessarily on you as a leader you might just need to move
that person on so that they can go work somewhere else if if working locally is not an option at your company or whatever else um but like yeah a AJ's in the chat right now speaking of remote workers I I had to yell at him on in his first week off because someone posted a task that needed to be done in the infrastructure chat and then he just did it before I could get to it and I had to be like hey it was so fast too that it was too fast I thought stop being so confident he's too confident
so I don't think motivation is like that I mean it again it's it becomes everyone has like burnout motivation problems every now and then especially when you work with people for a really long period of time they're going to do this it's okay but I don't think in general that's an issue with my team um I think it has been and I have dealt with oh Pocky nice um I think it has been and I've dealt with that usually by trying to work with that person to find ways to motivate them or in some situations uh
by moving them on to to some other form of work by exiting them from the company or their contract or whatever else um he has notifications off too wow so he manually checked it gez um so I don't know I try to do things like our our our meetings for the week we we have them longer than they need to be so people can have like water cooler style talk which I encourage but also try to cut off at a certain point um and I try to have some some much more relaxed uh channels in slack where people can talk
about like oh what games they're playing or music or whatever else so that you try to build a culture because one of the biggest problems with remote teams is you never build a culture um and that's actually a problem so there's a bit of a fine line where you want to encourage it but you also don't want people uh to partake way too much because especially with Ro root team you're probably in different time zones so someone's going to be off playing games wanting to talk about games while
someone else is in the middle of their work day and that's a notification that's coming in work chat so it's it's funky but you got to play the line I don't know I'm going to stop talking  hours uh what are your thoughts on the trend of putting titanium in everything put more titanium in my body I don't know titanium is pretty cool titanium seems pretty cool to me too please don't break things please uh I got a potential here there we go lonus and Luke with everything you've accomplished with lmg are you
satisfied have you satisfied a specific  to um no I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid that tracks I was just like and then later I wanted to be a teacher when I say I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid I mean I was in like grade two yeah I wanted to be an astronaut yeah those are the only jobs you know yeah ASA firefighter cop exactly doctor yeah doctor yeah doctor's good and so I basically I basically just became a teacher but without a degree and with way more  J you found the loophole oh no you won't
get in trouble for dick J he will still get in trouble for dick jokes I mean I can still get in trouble uh I wanted to work at a Game Dev Studio but with how everything's been going I feel like I dodged a bullet on that one oh yeah you did butd yeah oh my God good money for a while for a while yeah um at its core I wanted to kind of be the communication line between uh like business people and developers so that is legitimately a conversation I had with my dad um that he remembers in
like late high school where I was like I feel like this would be a good thing for me and then I literally ended up doing that so that part has worked out LTT making games LTT has technically made multiple games actually um LTT made lonus jump not wrong an actually very fun game that we should probably just release at some point um because it doesn't seem like we're going to use it anymore but it was used for the verified actual gamer program Luke we should go back to the old way we'll
make it a mobile game for like a dollar a dollar for mobile but we could probably figure it out I don't know how hard it would be to adapt and honestly if I told this to the person who made it they would probably just do it um so oh just make it 9 by 16 and it's instructions to do that please uh yeah dollar two whatever Jaden's sweating in his sleep yeah I would not make I would not make Jaden do it he's also not the one that made the game so it's okay um we've also made other games there's you we should
do are you allowed to make a game are you allowed to make a game one cent so that uh Google the transaction fees every time someone buys it I honestly don't know um the apps that we've released are are free the FL plane app is free because you pay for the subscription so I don't know appar apparently yes I don't I know if I believe that but we'll see we'll see you are yes what that's wild you used to be able to okay well we'll see that would literally just cost the money
because of the even if you're like oh but Google handles the credit card transactions yeah but they go through the credit card themselves yeah so they will lose money they probably have more favorable deals but um I guarantee you it's not that favorable yeah it also only has one level uh has a leaderboard did it I thought so really it's been so long I don't remember I don't think it did I think we had another every flavor bean I think we had a way yes I think we had a way to
look in to see how fast people had had had done it make more levels yeah but that takes Dev time that means it costs money just make chat GPT do it more level please and then it just outputs the the the uh  yeah one one node JavaScript please thank you oh yeah I have one more thing about Japan that I want to talk about oh boy are you complaining I cannot find any connection of things and the quity I have grossly overpaid for mediocrity at best and I have paid almost nothing for amazing quality have
you been in cities the whole time yes because I found when I got out of the big cities that completely stopped and I think it's uh maybe a touristy thing or like a expensive area versus cheaper area thing or something um but yeah that that get stuff affordably like I don't remember the last time my entire family had a sit down meal for about 10 bucks ahead but we had the entire Bill service fee included was like $56 at this place that was like in a mall you know like it
wasn't nowhere that like it wasn't like even a random home W or not a mall it was like you know they have these department stores here that are kind of like what we would think of as a mall but it's more just like a bunch of stores I don't know how to describe it it's slightly different um but it was like a restaurant essentially is what I'm trying to say uh and it was like great and cheap and then we'll go places where it's like oh that was $340 ahead and I'm just not really sure where it
went um and it just it there doesn't  there yeah yeah I was run noing I I didn't forget anything some of them include a $10 Serv or a 10% service fee I was running into very up and down quality very up and down pricing all of that type of stuff when I was like in Tokyo I didn't go to other major cities um and then when I got out of that major city and got into smaller towns smaller cities that type of stuff completely no longer a problem quality on average was much higher um I found personally people
are telling me that just means I was unlucky in Tokyo which is fine but I just that's what I experienced uh quality was really like everything was amazing and cheap out of the city Yeti Wrangler says that would be true almost anywhere though no no uh in Vancouver everything's expensive whether it's garbage or good yes so that's the difference every meal is $30 no matter if you're having like a three course Greek meal or going to McDonald's yeah everywhere yeah yeah and then in Taiwan
everything's cheap which isn't actually true it's really but it's hyper tourist trash areas this outro to the show thanks for watching guys see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel there we go bye oh you oh what did you do I pressed the intro button no no I broke it wait hold on I can do that yeah there we go nice you know what I'm doing sometimes this better be the correct one uh oh no oh my  terrible great uh wait wait oh hold on I got to stop the show
