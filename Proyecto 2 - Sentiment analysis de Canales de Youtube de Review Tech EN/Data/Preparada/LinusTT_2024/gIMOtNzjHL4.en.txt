we've all seen that listing the no low ballers I know what I have guy only what he had was a clue or Worse the ones who know darn well what their junk is worth but are just hoping that you don't and thanks to companies like Intel there's a lot of confusion out there by sticking with that I3 I5 i7 naming scheme for 13 years they've created an environment where the less informed consumer doesn't know if they're getting a great deal on still good leftover stock from last year
or if they're getting swindled on a decade old Workhorse well our team waited through listings from around the world and With a Little Help from you guys handpicked some of the worst offenders to give these folks a little reality check and for each one we're going to vote on whether we think they're a silly seller or a slippery scammer and you guys are going to decide if you think we're right and you can decide if you want to listen to this message from our sponsor oh vessie April

Linus Tech tips today you guys ready I haven't seen any of these yet number one  "$2,679 185 I thought we were supposed to" guess the price oh yeah no no you're guessing what it's actually worth oh we guess what it's actually worth this is what they're asking for oh that's
actually funnier that is kind of funny I'm going to have no idea cuz I don't buy PC parts what if they etsi here that's a bone stock case all they did was remove pieces this is a handmade computer Linus all computers were handmade I mean did they solder every pin onto the like CPU socket if they did it might be worth that much does it even have like the the panels I was not able to determine that actually What GPU is that it's not even an 80 series card okay this is worth
like three grand I don't even think it's worth that I was going to say 22 or 23 all right I'm going 2500 HDMI display port cable not included I love how that's like really important on a "$28,000 computer really it's a $20,000" cable prices right rules if you want okay it does include Windows It also says RGB fans times four and there's clearly six of them so I don't know what the they're talking about I don't think it's 2K I think it's more than 2K but then you guys are both sitting right up
in there 27 what I was able to find on "this was about 1,800 bucks I should have" "gone with 2K fl00 1,800 so we all lost" you all lost I was speaking Canadian all right that's fine the next one's coming here we go guys this is the same seller "rare find $1,000 does this at least" include the monitor keyboard mouse desk and rent for this room so this is the same seller what's the difference wait this is the same computer no it's not it's rainbow now no it's really similar it's very similar this is his basic
model so this seller does like teers of PCS they have tear do they have the tear of anyone who buys from them yes a 550 W power supply also this picture is clearly misleading that is not an RTX 3050 so basically slimy scammer and this thing is worth like 1100 USD $900 902 no one else even said a number  94 oh my God you're all over anyway wow there's about 800 bucks worth of parts in there okay I guess 900 with Windows Windows 11 yeah so we're not over you're pretty much right on I guess
so what is it then 900 so we were all over by two three so this is just his uh presence on Etsy there he has a bunch of machines to see Sweet Spot sweat spot actually sweat spot did you notice that those last three are all the same price though I did I think it's just a clever sales tactic I think that anyone wanting to buy a baller machine is going to sort by highest price they're going to come across this they're going to be like okay these machines look great what can
you do on price and then he might give them a real price one of those is an i5 yeah I think this is just the highest price that Etsy supports or something like that I was just going to say not a single one of the pictures is accurate I think it's just to get people to look at it high low call it a a slimy scan Hammer cuz I don't like that kind of stuff I'm actually planning a ranton w show for this very day talking about Facebook Marketplace pricing being free or a dollar or whatever and that not
being what is actually the case I really don't like that just tell me how much the thing costs and tell me that it's less than "$1,200 for an old Lenovo workstation 64" gigs of RAM ooh Quadro M series damn getting a uh one TB hard drive in your "1,250 USD do computer that's pretty" rough 525 I was going to say 5 you wouldn't have been able to find this stuff new so you found all the used used prices for this the SSD is not worth anything hard drivve is like 10 bucks I'm just worried about that Quadro
Quadro and the ram I think it's going to be the motherboard any piece Quadro is worth more than 20 bucks so what did you say make your own guess we should start writing them down damn it yeah why am I  guessing H I think we should have a time limit on this too I don't have a marker all right why would you go minus one we get this for 560 bucks ow point for lus I think this is just silly person they see Quadro and Zeon and they like think it's worth something "15,000 3050 holy crap we all know it's a"
scammer already look at that Ram oh my God they don't even have their RAM installed correctly dude it's America red white and blue that was not my point also their CPU Cooler looks like it has the fan on backwards fourth generation I5 oh it comes with the monitor that helps and the keyboard that monitor is curved baby I just don't want it yeah I'm way under whatever 747 what I well the panels didn't look like they were on that good you could build this for about $750 oh I
was let's go I think my issue is I just wouldn't like I I don't want any of this oh it's obviously a scam well the EVGA 750 watt like that's probably worth 90 bucks like you got to watch out for stuff like that selling pc800 if you butt before March 7th wait the price goes up that's not how computers work it's like a Kickstarter campaign it's it's Apple that adds a grand I always wonder about stuff like this you have almost nothing on your desk so that means whatever's on your desk has a high
level of intent do you need us to see you have a lighter that would immediately make me not buy it by the way because I would assume they smoke at their desk and you can get that like that like yeah it's very hard to clean out a computer no storage 64 gigs of RAM W did I snipe Elijah again I'm low Luke  $600 dang it open boxed buy it now for aund this is just a troll is this even a real computer it looks like it was made in a video oh it's Roblox the Roblox logo is in the top
left okay dude what of the users submitted this to us oh it's got all the specs see if you're gonna completely make up specs and pull them out of your ass why do you make up a 3600 why do you also say like 16 gigs of RAM and then you say 32 gigs of RAM I'm so confused what we're supposed to guess a price for this we're not guessing the you're just messing gaming PC $800 Callis spel this thing is beautiful whoa a Maximus r oh wow this is really old does not come with the monitor mouse keyboard it do
not come oh do make your guesses I'm making mine the dust is free so don't calculate that in $2.99 am I guessing High Again Luke bang on 400 bucks wow dang it how is this worth $400 though the motherboard like a motherboard from that era is worth like 30 bucks on eBay the best I could find was 130 bucks for that motherboard okay there's your discrepancy right there that's not worth cp's 50 bucks he said this whole time just a gosh darn he said this whole time it's based on what he's
been able to find based on what I can find on eBay hold on a second what is this Maximus nine oh Dad's mad again people are still buying these for $100 get a new computer the fact that it's Rog does not make it worth that I'm trying to figure out like what games could this play that you couldn't on a modern system nothing I'm a adjusting my strats then cuz I've been like what would I pay for it drop to 2K not budget everything in this piece top of the line from case to Parts what what
else is there including mobile nor do I play games intense enough to truly stress this system never overclocked never needed to getting rid of this because gaming has become a hindrance to my success in life his girlfriend was like get rid of the computer I love how it's topof the line Parts including mobo and then under mobo he says I don't know I'd have to unplug things to see what it  MSI no tough is usually associated with a Seuss wait did we decide if this guy was a scammer the last couple we have
skipped on that I don't think either of these guys are scammers I think they're reasonable I don't think this guy's a scammer either I think they're just an idiot I don't know we'd have to unug to be able to tell oh smile wow all right you're all over oh wao really all of us we can "build this for about 1,200 bucks really" "wow okay did you include Windows 1,300" bucks I don't think he lists windows I mean that's fair that's a tough one by MSI I say that you beat me to it
"$2,900 700 x3d deep cool liquid cooling" with RGB fans did some light gaming on it planning to sell due to personal reasons girlfriend again it's impairing his success in life seller rated at uh 2.9 Stars he's no man you can trust I mean based on this pricing that checks out 4070 super my brain at first was like is this a hard drive no it sounds like a SATA SSD all right I'm ready you ready hold on hold on I got to write I got to write oh man wow hurry up lus all right what do you got
"1,800 who where did you go Luke your" "bang on the money 1,500 bucks what is" wrong with you guys what the heck he it's got RGB fans in it why do you think "it was $1,800 us us are you guys doing" us I'm doing Canadian no okay that makes sense that's my excuse did you include Windows he doesn't say windows oh you know what it's so cheap because that drive is so slow okay so now we're in Spain what the hell is odori so this is a new seller selling on Facebook Marketplace for 100
bucks less than their than they retail so if you go to the next slide new computer this is their website same system so they don't want you to go to their own website apparently not warning comes with Windows 11 home and a disappointing amount of storage are PC components more expensive in Spain it doesn't matter Park price it for North America all right oh we're all pretty close pretty close on this one I think I'm too high Elijah you're pretty much run the money "right now 1,000 it's 1,000 1,000 only"
"1,000 oh I was going to do $9.99 prices" right rules you're over but you know well we'll give it to me no no that's not a point still in Spain here pcgb Corsair 32 gigs to Ram i7 to 12th gener CPU is a 12700 K is for gaming yes or KF sorry yes 3060 listed N9 weeks ago so things are going  guys okay we're all getting we're more reasonable uh Luke you got the win yeah come on that 1060 1060 how that seems ridiculous scammer or silly I don't want to complain too much cuz I won the round
so I kind of want us to not look into it they're a scammer they know what they paid for this it's a 3060 in there yeah whoa budy that looks sick it looks sick this is well beyond the ability of most buyers are we factoring in the build cost at all or is it just component just component so but we are factoring in like water blocks and Hardline tub see that's not how it works though a water cooled old card is worth less than an aircooled old card because no one wants to integrate it with that said it's
already in a system but I would say it probably comes out as a wash whereas if we actually go try to find pricing for this stupid block on eBay it's going to be like 80 bucks or something they got addin Ram cooling they're not water blocks they're just like passive heat sinks on the ram this is going to be nice aough one I've decided that I'm just going to price Things based on what I think they're worth whoa Elijah I think you've got it here no NOP it goes to line is cuz he's
lower 2186 21 a buddy's obviously knowledgeable enough to know what things are worth but I think that they are assigning a lot of value to the labor they clearly buil this themselves and I think that that's maybe not right but I don't think it's a scam I think they just think that the work they put into it is worth something and just doesn't work that way moving to La FR I don't speak French a gaming PC with an "exceptional value proposition at €2,500" it has the powerful RTX 47d 12 gig from
Asus it offers performance in games unequaled guaranteed to give you an immersive experience in ultra high quality the processor in Ram assures optimal uh responsiveness allowing something de fees virtuels  oh whatever I liked the lest translation experience my translation pretty good they're pricing it at $2700 you got this Elijah you can still come back yeah can you get stuff right that would help me a lot I would appreciate are we on a team yeah oh we are oh okay well he's not going to share
the victory with you he just doesn't want me to win yeah I'm ready I made lots of assumptions this time I don't know what any of of them were or how they affected anything all right who wow that's a pretty good spread yeah uh winner is going to be Luke at 1100 oh oo really did you count for the power supply it has to run a 4070 Jordan yep I love the moment lonus wins he's like cool next one the second anyone else wins he's like did you take into account W so this one I want to price
without the water cooler cuz I wasn't able to price that out this is super "cool it's very cool $4,400 yeah is it" "$4,400 cool okay okay okay okay a ton of" this is because it's like artistic though so like just worry about the core components so no cooling we're not assuming any price on the woodwork or anything like that this guy filthy scammer oh yeah fil yeah yeah this is super cool too bad he filled the loop with C what everyone was thinking it I think we're going to have to have a float
plane exclusive for this one lg. g/ playe for the uh dirty version yeah yeah the raw version yeah to get off of that topic I'm highly insulted that this system comes with a 250 gig SSD I know it also comes with another one but still yeah I got to say none of that is very good sounding it also has an 8700k well they probably built this a long time ago and then upgraded the GP and then now that's not going to fly anymore so they're like okay screw it go uh without the water cooling this is
about 550 bucks what what 550 380 TI 32 "gigs of ddr4 1,000 W power supply yeah" come on Jordan see now you see what I'm talking about here anytime Luke's right he's all like yeah seems good and then anytime he's all he's all like oh did you consider I missed the GPU I apologize you missed the the GP so it's 500 bucks without the GPU the GPU how much is uh 380 TI okay I'm getting I got it then 600ish no you'd be over cuz if it was 500 without it you guess $9.99 which means I would have it cuz I guess
"$1.99 550 plus the GPU so 11,00 it's a" pretty old platform how much did you guess I guess $199 it might be him either way it's not lonus no no yeah he's way too high now this looks like Brazil but it's actually South Africa wait so this is just a GPU just the GPU for $800 yeah I'm looking for used eBay pricing here wow that might be before Elijah was born even L is writing a lot right now yeah he wrote a lot of things oh you still oh come on Luke I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm done I'm done three
two go you're oh wow we're tied we're all high all high liners he's high yeah it's 30 bucks on eBay wao I thought 89 just cuz like people were just going to be out to lunch yeah like that's kind of what I fig 780 Ti don't have driver support anymore and stuff the market for this stuff crashed a little while back what the hell is this that's so many fan Ultra 4K gaming PC that video card looks so lonely this is like one person living "in a 20,000 ft Mansion I'm so mad about"
like everything this is so annoying that's a 490 and it still looks comically small look how much intake they have the cable management is atrocious are we drawing or are we actually done I'm drawing I'm ready I'm drawing let's go flip 2800 28 okay I'm way oh I went way freaking High I saw the fans there's 12 RGB fans in there yeah Elijah you're closest SP you're over the lus gets it what is it I got a 3320 3320 oh how much are used 490s about two grand yeah two grand he's
probably not a scammer it's just a bad build and yeah last one what is happening all the things are happening there are rainbows 5500 bucks does he have a screen on the inside of his computer is that factor I'm assuming no I I didn't calculate that in yeah okay serious queries only are you guys even serious uh the mouse is not included a that's a deal breaker for me  go oh lonus is closest but is he over no just about four grand it's not a cheap case the fans are expensive there's nicer stuff
overall the stupid little RGB strip thing is expensive yeah those are like 100 bucks oh what they're ridiculous no way that's like 70 on eBay the little screen is pretty cheap that's not a big deal but okay what was the final tally I believe lonus Has It by like one what no there's no way Luke won I think the viewer won you know who really won our spons our sponsor paper like while we all have our own way of taking notes be that in a business meeting or during class I think
