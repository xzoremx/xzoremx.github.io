we've bought a lot of weird stuff on AliExpress over the years the difference is this time we're doing it on purpose the challenge was simple bu the weirdest thing you can find present it to the rest of the group along with a justification for what makes yours the weirdest tech product each of us will vote for two that we think are the weirdest and the winner gets a trophy there's a trophy involved that's it well you're the writer right you got the trophy right I totally have a trophy yes
absolutely have a trophy and you wrote a segue right to the sponsor G skill create macros or shortcuts and display your system performance with the widie dash a 7-in touch panel from gskill designed to fit your workflow learn more   below off to a great start you couldn't afford a Nook so you got a Muk Muk AI or I I'm not sure it's an h61 motherboard which came out what 2011 or so okay but the cool part is this is not from 2011 this is I'm pretty sure from 2023 and the best part is that it has an m.2 nvme
wait it came with all of that on it no no no no I added all this just so that this was a little faster for the video what I don't know is does this m.2 nvme slot actually support nvme cuz that came out like 2013 two years later what's the chipet h61 are you sure about that because I do recall that we have done a video where we had a motherboard like this that said it was a chipset that it actually wasn't somebody wrote on this in pencil oh yes yes just like the last time if this is
an h61 then how is it supporting an I3 2150 or 20 or whatever I have in there uh Russians what yeah yeah no there's like a whole Russian Community around this kind of thing uh I think mostly they focus on Zeon processors but the chipset should still work it's a whole thing yeah they remanufacture the boards there's this great Tik Tok I think of this guy just sitting in a warehouse somewhere with a giant box of motherboards and then yeah a little jig where he goes and it just cuts the chipset off
the board and he hws the board behind I love angle grinder Electronics well we don't know who's going to win but I think we know who's not going to win so why don't we move on to our next contestant oh no okay I'm going to need a mouse oh I have one is that your item yeah oh here's the thing about this it it's got top rotation Papa coin all right and for that you got you want to use your what is top rotation Papa coin well you use your your thumb to spin the top rotation Papa coin until it goes K C I
read the manual this is a new species of fingertip gyro okay that legitimately looks pretty cool it looks pretty cool it's got a rem it's got a removable fuel tank what fuel tank yeah removable fuel tank look right here that's how you know it's strong it's got dark wire right on the left button here's the papa coin use your thumb to go cut cut cut were you a late night TV pitch Man In Another Life your pitch is so frantic that it sounds like they have your family like you you
need to sell this mouse well it's me and Vince offer left uh they used to call me Billy Mae but really the biggest selling feature of this is right here who has the biggest hands okay just hold your hand like that lift up your fingers it's a fidget oh my God okay  sick wow all right video done we truly  wins wa nice catch you drop enough things you get good catches who you broke it no I broke nothing I think it's supposed to do this is that the removable fuel tank it could be wait so
where is the dongle for it then oh it's in there is it remove fuu tank hey wow this is premium quality they just put screws into the plastic and that's what the magnets mag I've got no problem with that it's not stupid if it works you're going to talk about that you're not going to go after this paint job this is worse than pl's car Colin could you go get an air compressor air compressor don't ask I think we have to see it in action okay I think so uh okay do we have to
run it on pl's computer or can we run it on a real we have a test bench there all right we have a test bench there what what about pl's computer what's wrong with that what is that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hey American Meat Trends oh I believe it what okay this is incredible we put windows on both this nvme drive and then a backup SATA SSD just in case oh it didn't actually support it as a boot Drive oh no never underestimate Russian hackers mine clearly works so that's you 
yeah there we go can we get a tachometer oh it's going blue screen no my computer no that's not a  going Alex kind of has two my first one's banned Adam is unfortunately sick today uh so Alex is going to choose his item but he did buy something ages ago yes band like in the country we're in or just like no as we're not allowed to make the video so what I have right here is an RGB kit for a Mark 7 G oh my God this is not a computer item Alex it's RGB that's the most computer item
of them all so basically you just used our budget to buy something for your car no I put this in as a joke and then you approved it and procurement got it I never wanted it in the first place the system works I don't see any RGB in there there's no RGB on this Alex you got scammed oh here's the RGB oh oh there we go oh my God so this right here has to be put in there I guess I looked at the instructions and includes a lot of dremeling like fiber optic why is this so dirty wait so does the car like
natively have RGB yeah well right now it natively has R there's just red lights what's that say dead project RGB for VW Golf could be used for worst AliExpress products exactly okay why don't you go get your real item then so this is what I have from Adam he said the one I got is much bigger than the other ones I have seen I have no idea about safety so  guess oh my God I know what that is oh my God is a musical Tesla coil I don't know if that's computer parts it hooks into a computer
a speaker's a computer part is that fiber optic yes this is fiber optic what cuz you want to isolate you know your control Electronics from your high voltage Electronics right but not your body no you can touch it can you like lick it I wouldn't but like you can would you do it for 20 bucks what's the needle for what's the needle for well right now  needle okay I'll turn it off for a sec ow so you need the needle okay yeah so that it can do that that's very that's great
yeah that's not annoy at all I can smell it yeah you can smell it for the audio I'll just turn it off for a second basically how this works is that normally it's operating at somewhere around 100 khz which is way higher than what you can hear so what we're doing is we are turning it off when we want there not to be sound and then back on when you want sound so say that you want "1,000" you just turn it on and off a thousand times in a second and you get a tone so we can turn it back on wow that's great
wow what a useful thing that I wish I had in my home how does this integrate with a computer Alex yeah well it's a speaker so we can turn it over to music  god oh incredible it's sparking out the tip oh jeez you are not oh oh that's not so bad oh yeah hold on it arcs to his fingers yeah does that hurt it's tingly the higher tones that's hilarious oh the very first musical LTT screwdriver  okay that more than tingles scary also I was touching the power supply on the other
side I think it stopped working when you touched that oh oh my God he killed it no way it just muted oh it's like going up but not going up it's just constantly muting I expected this to be wonderful I expected this to be able to solve all of our problems really I don't think it's going to do that no uh the app first of all is not on the App Store they give you an APK you can just download and S side load on your Android phone super we tried to do it on a pixel and it didn't
work because it's too new so this is plold phone it's great why are the options doubt and don't understand what is this fwn so to doubt um this is supposed to be a diagnostic tool for computers we do have some adapters for like m.2 uhhuh so in theory I'm hoping we could test an m.2 slot if we're going to plug this into anything it's going to be plof oh yeah the slot so we can test no might as well use this one that says pcie it's specifically said in the app or the manual or somewhere don't plug in
the PCI one into the pcie that might break it anything will fit if you try hard enough it's plugged in it's powered blinking do I press doubt doubt just brings up follow the onscreen instructions idiot it's apparently Bluetooth so let's find that it's connected now all right everything's done but what does it do it's successed why do you ask so many bloody questions turn turn the computer on okay and in theory this is now going to read the diagnostic code okay oh oh it's oh it's actually working
who whoa we're getting post codes out of a board that doesn't have post codes but we got the current code is 1D PCI RS good h s o n0 good hsop P0 good I love having good uh help H so oh wait a second it says if the computer Compu fails please eliminate the memory failure first this is just basic diagnostic steps it doesn't tell me 1 is okay it's saying that 1D already shown below the code it's telling us that's what 1D is so in theory this is maybe not compatible with this wonderfully
standard chipset why don't we try that other computer PCI bus proper connection oh look you click on these and it shows you a photo of how to connect it oh it can test USB oh no way USB test passed CPU motherboard memory and USB controller all work h  maybe okay uh ploof sidebar what we're not supposed to have sidebars here's the situation it's AliExpress I wasn't sure how many if any of these items were going to arrive so I order like four things yeah do you think these Pokemon cards
are authentic I think that they don't hook up to a computer one of my items is this and what I would like to know is do you think these are authentic Pokemon cards oh I don't know let's find out okay here let's each take let's each take a pack I love cracking packs okay first thing I'm noticing is they are in French a a FR glass I don't know do Pokemon cards Canadian I don't know if these are real dude they don't feel thick enough you might have gotten scammed all right so
you got fake Pokémon cards no no they are proxies if you rip a cards in half there should be a black line in the middle a black line oh yeah yeah magic does the same thing okay yeah no no they are very fake do you even remember what you ordered no I'm kind of leaning toward this one but this is tempting too I'm going to do the range I don't think the range extender is going to take that long it's also not a range extender what I kind of have two one of which I think is really weird and one of which I think
might legitimately be useful this is just a a mining Riser this is not not a mining Riser this my friend is a pcie to PCI adapter we could have used this during the last video yeah we need to test it well this is the 2001 Maximum PC dream machine complete with 100 megabit fast networking ethernet card and Hercules XP sound card with 3D acceleration did not receive the diagnostic code all right let's see if an actual card works though I have seen these so many times and I've
been tempted so many times but I've never had any reason to actually buy one because I don't have any PCI cards that I legitimately need to use so here we go theoretically you can just Mount this daughter board anywhere in the chassis plug in your old school PCI cards right definitely have drivers for a little something like that yeah I mean I don't know man I got no idea right whoa whoa whoa wait for whoa whoa whoa Multimedia Audio control are you kidding me realistically this was just for fun cuz
I wanted an excuse to buy it my real one is right here wow this is the one I'm most excited about jeez it came detached it is a USB Wi-Fi card with a built-in cantana what so the idea here is that if you have like a shed or a workshop or a distant location on your property that you need to get Wi-Fi to you can aim your antenna directly at your Wi-Fi router for an improvement in Signal Integrity what Wi-Fi standard does this I am not sure rtld drivers. like oh my God I don't even and definitely no viruses
xp64 yeah setting up device setting up device RT something Wireless oh yes it's alive it take the pull the cable out it only says it's 802.11g I just want to know is this antenna actually even connected inside  here oh it is oh my God it is oh wow okay look at that solder drop that's mint oh wow it looks like they just took a pair of side Cutters to the corner of this PCB did they just put a GL Bob of solder to hold this in place on a screw you got to do what you got to do what
the heck that is exactly what they did you see this that's really bad if we plugged a working Wi-Fi device into this there is no reason why this wouldn't work unfortunately um we were not able to find modern working drivers for this particular Wi-Fi chipset I'm going to go first uh pretty tough really real good competition here but Tesla coil 100% is getting a vote and then number two I think has to be the fidget spinner Mouse as somebody with a Double Diamond AliExpress account
the only two the only thing that has not been advertised to me is the Tesla coil however pl's motherboard is also very interesting because when we did a video on this concept it was about a tbow PC which is technically not the same thing as AliExpress I'll take it I'm going to have to vote for the Tesla coil and the mouse damn I'm getting shafted you know what okay Tesla coil and Jake diagn vote I have to vote for the solder joint in that dish yes I get one vote and the mouse of course I didn't get a single
vote you did I gave you one no I don't that doesn't count this isn't even yours though no Adam wins by proxy so far so far I'm going Mouse and mouse and Wi-Fi yes two votes for no I don't want your pity vote maybe as actually is it a tie between the Tesla coil and the mouse yeah well what do we do then we only have one trophy okay we have a deciding vote Andy rock paper scissors Tesla coil or the mouse I'm going to give you give the Tesla Adam is the winner I sort of won by proxy his trophy
is this model of a Tesla coil I want the pair what I want the parrot you didn't win you didn't even pick it wait that parrot he wants the parrot he wants the set dressing you can't have that well what w yeah that's a company parrot you have to give it to Adam fine what is that supposed to be a parrot a look at the top what the hell's in theak no idiot the top I got a Le okay that I don't know it looks like it holds something yeah you know what else it holds it holds the segue to our
