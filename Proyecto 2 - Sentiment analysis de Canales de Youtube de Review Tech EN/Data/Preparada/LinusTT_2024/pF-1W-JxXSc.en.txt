I would like the first words I say to not be cut off this time oh I've been told that the last couple streams we've done the first word's been cut off so oh you're too fast I gave myself a longer Millennial pause and it is going to be a great w show worth waiting for for a couple of seconds we are going to be doing a video soon on kind of tech gripes and so that's where the title comes from I've got 99 problems and I'll make a video on some so we're going to be giving you guys
some of the gripes that we found we'll be taking suggestions from you guys getting some verification from you guys cuz Hey if there's an easy workaround then we don't want to waste anybody's time in our Tech rpes video we are looking to have things actually solved here in other news HP is downgrading printer features when you don't buy genuine ink it's not as bad as it sounds but given that it sounds so bad that's a really low bar what else we got this week Luke yeah uh we have an update on
FTC Banning hidden fees from hotel and ticket prices I believe last time we talked about it it was a possibility and now there's a date which is which is good that's three topics though that are like not going to keep people engaged for a whole show can you pick one good one uh oh terrible uh terrible there's definitely going to be inappropriate mods for Final Fantasy 7  I'll keep him   a the show is brought to today by Ridge rocket money pulseway and the quiet move we pulled where we doubled our sponsors
with LG as our laptop partner dbrand as our rap partner and secret lab as our chair partner that was quite the gamer move dude no one called us on it yeah literally no one it's good stuff the business team over there man they're just they're just cooking go business team just wait till we double it again you're going to you're you're going to see yeah how can we do that there's got to be a way all right so we are making a video with complaints about tech not big complaints like the ongoing March toward
zero ownership and liking it the complete disregard for the ecological impact of AI or the in ification of absolutely everything we're talking small things like how cookie settings are specifically designed to be user hostile and intimidating so you'll just click invade my primac Primacy invade my Primacy do it now invade my privacy or how power saving mode on Windows 11 renders the battery icon useless you ever noticed that no power saving mode comes on you get the little icon you
can't tell how CU it puts the thing it puts the thing in the front we've got other good stuff to do with the notification tray on on Windows like how if you have a bunch of them queued up and you're trying to click something behind them while they one after another come up and get in your way it's actually impossible Window search has got to be in here uh yeah no no we want this is supposed to be like nitpicks it's supposed to be little specific details like major problems yeah it
can't be major problems so one of the ones one of the ones that bothers me a lot uh for this one we're going to and so the goal here guys is for you to tell us hey there's a super easy workaround to that um all you had to do was this so we can make sure we don't waste anyone's time you guys are you guys are being our our factchecking department here so we're going to take a little trip to my inbox going to lonus laptop here we go boom my spam folder let's go oh I'm getting some info from Scientology here
we go so this is something that drives me AB absolutely knucking FS if I find something in here like oh oh this Zoom meeting or here let's find something that's just absolutely like the worst uh sure bright HR I don't even know what bright HR is but I don't recommend it because they spam me okay so I'm going to click on this okay if I say not spam  what happened Luke it went away it went away I'm still in my spam folder I don't do you know where it went I'm assuming to your unread it went
to my inbox it did not Mark unread oh it goes in a red state to your inbox so it disappears so it disappears no longer on your screen and it's now marked red which I have been which I have been which I have been meaning to deal with uh which I've been meaning to talk about for a long time cuz this is the kind of little thing that drives me absolutely nuts I haven't replied to this I haven't actioned it in any way all that happened was I saw something that I was like oh
shoot that's not spam and and the reason this came up was an introduction that narv the CEO of framework wanted to make for me uh so heems me he's like hey here's someone who's working on something cool that might interest you are you interested in an intro I go yes and then he says okay sure thing I'll make the intro and then nothing and then the intro never happened a week later I get a ping I think it was from narv I don't remember but he's basically like I thought this was hey I thought I
was making an intro you said you were cool with it you don't reply to people maybe he didn't maybe I just maybe I projected all that onto myself when I found a week old email in my inbox from Buddy who's working on the cool thing that just went to my spam and get this get this it gets even worse because I did realize that this would happen because I've encountered this before and it annoys me so I so I found it I marked it not spam and remember how Gmail used to have a function to Mark a sender safe
yeah well that's gone so I've had people multiple times email me and end up in my spam because because there's no obvious way to Mark a sender safe so anyway so anyway I I go I dig it out of my inbox I make sure I remember the name of the person who sent it right so I can go search for it in my inbox because I use my inbox like a to-do list so I have like sometimes 100 unread items in my inbox and anything that's red is gone I'd be okay if it had to like basically reload like if it moved it and then
reopened it for you sure I'd be fine that would be fine be fine with that if it if it had to be that so I went I remembered the name I went I got it and I replied to it I was like hey can you have your people schedule a time with my people and I cced my people get this Budd he replies he's like here's some good times for me Vance had it go to his spam so he only saw it to set up a time because he happened to check his spam what is what is this person sending from it sounds like their domain is I mean I
I can I can check now I can check now it's probably a relatively new domain I can tell you that no it's a Gmail account air a in full point chat said read the notification it does Mark the cender save so maybe it's just like a combo button now except if it didn't i' I swear to you I SW I swear on my mother's grave that I have had it h my mother's not dead um that I've had it happen where I have said this is not spam and anyway we work in a Google we work in a Google uh GSU domain I marked
it safe so why is it going to Vance's spam then that just happened like just just now just happened yeah I don't know if like marked safe senders is is works space wide I mean should it be a an indicator uh maybe from uh I don't know to be honest I don't think so yeah cuz I mean okay I could see because while it could be a good indicator for safe senders assuming everyone is like Savvy and does it properly not but it could also it could also amplify bamboozlement so that's potentially dangerous you're
right yeah and if you if you like yeah I don't know if you if you convince someone through social engineering on a completely unrelated team but within the same organization that you are a safe sender and then you send garbage to other people on the team knowing that you're manually flagged is safe yeah that's fair from this random person in the company Asaf 400 says happened to me this week marked not spam same sender went to spam um also other emails from the same sender still stuck in spam each
needing to be manually put in the inbox so so that's that's mine that's my contribution to the uh the tech tech gripes video we've got a couple of other ones um here's one there's still still no good way to transfer files from Android to iOS Android has Quick Share iOS has airdrop but there is no like Rock Solid way to share files between devices furthermore it can be a challenge to get files to a PC as well that should be with Wi-Fi Direct that should be such a solved problem and
there are there are ways to do it like it's not like you can't pair your Android phone to your uh to your Windows PC it's it's a whole thing when you're setting up Windows it prompts you to do it and everything but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about Luke snaps a quick picture on his phone and is like hey can I send this to you and I'm like yo I just turned on my sharing airdrop style and it just farts over onto the laptop that that that that needs to that needs
to be a thing Google Quick Share that works I love it isn't that more uh Android Android not KDE connect I mean I can already tell you just from the name of it that that is not going to be what like my aunt is GNA use um saleesh says share it used to be the app to do it until Apple removed it from the app store oh man I love that it's Android to Android to Windows yeah it doesn't solve the problem un I love that I'm going to put down I'm going to put down a few of these for us to look
into I've got local send here someone's like I just used Discord oh that is so sad that should not be the way that is that is largely what I do though that is actually sad that is I agree actual ass I fully agree that is ass and I don't mean like but I don't mean like attractive like thick ass I mean like like with hair everywhere oh yeah like everywhere like long like like on your head long like just like Shaggy yeah Shaggy ass what else we got Windows set Windows settings here's a
good one why is Windows settings limited to a single window have you noticed that the modern settings menu you can only have one window open yeah yeah that's annoying yeah what the heck yeah it's not like gamebreaking but it's annoying okay I think I'm I'm think I'm starting to embrace the theme and since we're in the settings menu since since we're talking about it why exactly is it that time and language is deserving of space here when display sound power and Battery these are all things that do not
Merit the top level of the sidebar are you kidding me how often how often do you change the time on your computer in the age of you've got it knows the location and automatically adjusts your time zone your time and everything because obviously I do find that to be kind of weird too the amount of times that I have to uncheck and then recheck automatically set time zone to be like hello and then it it wakes up and does it for me it's like okay thanks Eternal griever says this is
actually something that's been grinding my gears recently right uh okay what else we got um app section is the most random assortment of settings offline maps video playback uh the windows 11 context menu right clicking now has show more options you click it and 80% of the options are the same because it just goes to the old menu just show me all the options I actually really really hate that there's that's two clicks now to get to a lot of the right right click context menu stuff you can do that like
God mode thing okay so I do think that's solvable okay you can also remove it as well I think we talked about that earlier in the week yeah there are SOL computer and they're not default so it's still annoying MH but there are solutions that's a big part of the tech gripes video is we want to present Solutions and if the solution is here's a quick registry um you know dword that you can reconfigure then that's great um or if the solution is uh Hey if you could just add like three lines of code um hello
anyone this is not going to make it into the video because no one cares because no one uses Xperia phones but I I saw a post recently asking why none of the big tech tech YouTubers review xeria phones and the answer is because no one cares they're super expensive and limited availability outside of Japan in certain regions um but for me I can tell you the reason that I don't daily one is because even now after all these years all these years Sony still hasn't added like the
the like three lines of code that it would take to swap the back button and the task switcher button or whatever the whatever the square one is called I prefer the back button on the right I have homunculus hand I am right-handed I cannot reach back all the way across on the left I use back a lot you might say everyone's going to I like back I'm a back Enthusiast okay I like it I like to be able to reach it I like to be able to get my thumb wait okay the point is just that I need that button a lot and if
it's over on the other side it's really hard for me to re to  sorry let's just continue um works if any if anyone from Sony is watching and didn't get totally bothered by all of that um I will immediately I want the headphone jack I want the taller form factor I want the gorgeous display I want the camera I want everything that is really good about the Experia just just allow me to swap it just let me move the buttons you don't even have to do it by default just let me move the butt if you get the Hong
Kong one we can r it and just switch it over panthus pomus says they're never going to do it yeah I I know I know I know but they're they're never going to do it um oh man yeah I think Center start menu that's more of just like a design thing sorry I'm just going through some of the stuff in my dock uh we've got oh man this is amazing anyone here on Mac OS shout out if you're on Mac OS in the chat okay hit me up Apple finally added window management with snapping finally they didn't have
snapping no you could get it with a third party app for like $3 or something but I it'll be a cold day in Hell before I pay $3 for basic window management functionality that's been in Linux since I worked at NC like no so they added they added windows spping but it has a border for no apparent reason Jake showed me this and my mind was blown it has a border around it where you can see the your desktop wallpaper wait what for no reason oh no that would bother me so much for like no reason I am Oh I
thought you meant it was like framed like a photo and I was like that's weird but it doesn't bother me that much being able to see the desktop background would constantly make me think that it's not actually there you can turn it off okay you can turn it off but the fact the fact that that is the default Behavior that they show the user is absolutely mindblowing to me that's so annoying um this next one oh oh this is great on the uh uh on um on Max that have the um the the the gaping wound in their display
the island sorry um oh dude sounds so much more metal called the gaping wound D I was oh sorry wrong phone where's my oh right I put it away because it was buzzing the mic on my iPhone I was uh I was looking at some meme like one of those like uh like four pictures from Lord of the Rings with captions style memes yeah and I literally couldn't read the top one because of the stupid island thing and then I was watching I was watching a movie I was watching a movie on my phone and my my choices were
basically because Plex is not perfect not a perfect application I either had like giant black bars around everything or I had a hole in the movie and I was like I can't I actually cannot watch a movie with a hole in it that's impossible like I'm not going to be one of these pretentious Hollywood directors that's like my movie is mastered for the theater well if it's not watched in the theater then I'm afraid it simply cannot be enjoyed by your primitive eyes like I'm I'm not like that about it but you
put a hole in the screen are you kidding me like that I I have lines I have standards um anyway so on on Macs that have the island you can uh you can like full screen like like mac full screen like like distraction free mode or whatever but your taskbar goes away at the top only for it to be filled with black pixels because of the because they have to have a border for the entire top because of the stupid hole in the screen because there might be content there uh really funny I don't I don't know if
that's one that'll make it to our gripes cuz nothing can really be done about that than make better Hardware in the first place um this is a good one this was almost an entire video and maybe it still could be at some point just like diagnosing um computer sleep issues like sleep wake screen turning off issues so I was having a problem when we set up the land Center in the basement I had five identical machines with five identical monitors with five identical sets of peripherals and I couldn't f figure out
why half of them were going to sleep properly and half of them weren't that's annoying you know what it was yes technically but no yes thank you thank you for not ruining my setup for once I app Luke I appreciate you thanks man um so I almost made a whole video on this so that we could just as a springboard to talk about how to diagnose these issues but what What It ultimately was was I got into the administrator level command prompt and power config it was steam but it was specifically because I
had steam open on all of them and what I found out was that steam will not let your computer go to sleep if you are open to the store tab even if steam is minimized so you had so the ones that were sleeping were on Library cuz I I read that and I was thinking like I always have Steam on like all my computers on your library probably but it's probably on Library it's probably on Library so the reason it's a good reason the reason is that it's something to do with video playback on the store
Page and how if you're playing back video your computer doesn't go to sleep so if there's any video playback or a video player that is open the system won't sleep it blew my flipping mind blew my mind or sorry not sleep display display un waking maybe it'll still sleep sorry sorry but specifically what I was working on was my displays wouldn't blank so I was thinking like it's to I've never been because my computer always goes to sleep yeah this current iteration of my computer is has
no sleep problems it's very nice that's nice I'm used to having some weird sleep issue yeah so uh so if there's anyone here that is like oh my God sometimes my display doesn't turn off yeah that's cool I bet you it's that cuz if you think about it the steam store Page is just a browser yep and any ad for any game or whatever is just a video if you have a video open in your browser even if it's in the background your screen's not going to turn off I wonder how much bandwidth uh
just leaving the steam store Page up on your screen for like a week takes I have no idea because it's a pretty solid amount of video actually it's probably very like low res but still but yeah I was I was thinking of making that an entire video just as an excuse to talk about like sleep and and Screen timers and all that kind of stuff but then we just kind of never got around to it and we didn't have a great title for it and anywh who uh Smart TVs LG lets you go offline and
not get ads but if you want to use an app it asks you to update you can use the app but have to navigate around the prompt you must log in to update and then our second one is the entirety of ties and Os I think that's too broad I think that's too broad Adam I don't think we're going to do that one they're to be they're supposed to be nitpicks I feel like I feel like Adam has a TV with ties and Os um monitors personally bothered why do certain presets lock me out of certain features without any
Rhyme or Reason actually Adam I can probably I can explain some of that at least um there are certainly ones where it's like no I I don't get that at all but like filmmaker mode for instance will lock you out of a lot of the TV settings because it wouldn't be filmmaker mode if you were allowed to change a bunch of stuff however most TVs in filmmaker mode will allow you to set the white point up some of them will lock you in warm because that is like a film maker I do not like the
"warm preset I prefer 6,500 Kelvin and" don't don't touch my white Point um but anyway the point is that that some of them do make sense some of them absolutely don't if there was one that we were going to if there was one that we were going to rant about when it comes to monitor settings then I would say it's the one where you're not allowed to change any settings if you don't have an active input yeah why not old monitors used to used to let you have them on and play around with all their settings and
everything yeah whereas now you you you you can't tell sometimes if your computer is broken and not outputting or if your monitor's not on and not receiving a signal it drives me absolutely crazy I didn't know that was an issue but I have used that to try to diagnose if my computer is properly sending out display drives me flipping Anno crazy uh belrick says well the settings are tied to Signal type there are plenty that aren't yeah and I just want it to be on so I know it's on so that I so that I
know what input it's on and that it's looking for Signal give me something give me something um okay uh we've got a lot of teams ones I feel like I I'm hesitating I could add so many more but I feel like it would just take up it' be a whole video so like uh one of these is notifications steal input Focus for some reason teams notifications have gotten me killed in deadlock don't ask me why I'm on teams and playing deadlock uh teams notification is separate from Windows integrated popups
that's actually super annoying especially because they're in the same place Y come on Microsoft you literally make this software um why can't I schedule a message to a group chat that I haven't messaged before so if you have like a shoot in the morning or something like that and you put together everyone that's on that shoot and you just want to like schedule you you just can't because I don't know whatever it wants me to keep going I I can I can send a bunch of stuff later I I mean i' I've
ranted about this on the W show before and I think people are a little tired of it so I don't want to go through way too many of it but like my the the main two that frustrate me is that I can't schedule a message to a group chat that I haven't sent a message to before Adam added and this is super annoying why can't I schedule a reply to a thread just like and I I understand some of the theory of not being able to schedule reply to a thread because I think they're worried that like other things
will be sent before that one I could see that my team's General like etiquette for this is just put scheduled in Brackets y this is super normal everyone does this we're not big brain solvable this is extremely solvable stop like not allowing us to do okay I'm going to relax um the other primary annoing thing that I have is the amount of times that I'm in teams calls and people go is my mic working cuz they can't see it light up yeah just whoa the spider oh he was there is he in my
headphones he might be he's he's a crafty little guy s for people that weren't part of the pre-show there was a spider that climbed up onto the desk and  directly there was a spider that crawled up under the desk and went directly into one of my USB ports and hid under the little USB finger and then he he took off like I think it was like a minute into the show and maybe went into linus' headphones I would strongly prefer to not put these headphones on if there could be a spider inside them yeah
definitely small enough to crawl into your ear yeah okay no now now I'm really I'm really creeped out right now if there's a spider in my headphones for I uh I would be I would be super super unhappy words could not describe the level of unhappy that I would be if a spider like crawled across my face another I I'll add another one too dude I know it's not poisonous I don't care I do not like it it's not the poison part it's the digging into your ear part anyways um it's not even that I just I don't need a
reason to not like spiders that's fair from an evolutionary standpoint a fear of spiders and snakes and like dead things and all the stuff that I kind of phobia is what kept my ancestors alive and damn it I'm going to uphold their legacy here and continue to be afraid of those things however irrational it might be they're all watching down on you not wanting to put your headphones on and cheersing the glass being like yeah no I'm I'm okay I have thoroughly searched them Dan was going to bring me new
headphones but it's okay Dan I'm ready um ready the the last thing I'll say about teams is if I'm in slack and I attach something to a chat message or even just attach something in general I can just press send right away before it finishes attaching and the message will just send when it's done attaching you try to do that in teams and I don't remember it like opens it or something it it does whatever it does it's annoying and it doesn't send it that's all so I have to sit there and just wait
for it to attach and if it's like a video it might take a little bit dude I've never I've never really used iMessage because no one that I know uses iMessage so why would I Y um but man the reply function is awful oh like you like you when you when you hold on something to like reply to a specific message you know um or you don't use WhatsApp but you know how it works in any sensible program where it just gives you like a preview of the original message and then just has it indented and like has the
reply to it it creates this like new popup window oh and then like getting out of it is like like like you have to like click somewhere else entirely on the screen and it kind of has like these like reply threads within the thing it's ridiculous I was like how how did a trillion dollar company Design This I couldn't I couldn't believe it that seems not awesome um yeah I I never used it during my during my time with the iPhone but it was something that I encountered like just the other day cuz
I was chatting with um John from htech um about some hexos thing and I had I had to reply to something specific because we kind of had two threads going we were like talking about Christmas plans and also talking about like future hexos plans and you know you know how those things could get a little bit confusing right cuz he could be like you know oh I had a close relative die so this will be our first Christmas without them also we got this great feature planed and I could be like wow that's so
cool which one was I replying to who knows yeah reply reply threads are good yeah reply threads are good anyway the point is yeah it's aw yeah we've got a couple people backing me up in chat here so apparently this isn't just me being crazy um I think we could actually Adam who's obviously watching the show right now I think we could even steal some of the stuff from the uh the iOS Time video uh oh dude YouTube music don't get me started on YouTube music okay Adam here's one you probably don't know um if
you if you have your main Google account on your phone for some reason as a different account from the one that has a premium subscription and has YouTube music you will not be able anymore it used to work but you can this is what ultimately made me switch from my like G Suite account as my main account on this device to my like personal random Gmail that I don't even really use other than to have YouTube premium on um you in with Android auto you can't use voice control to play a specific song on
YouTube music unless your Google account like your main one that you're like mainly signed into the phone with is the one that has premium so just like having another one you can't select which account you have and and oh oh it's so annoying I really wish like I I think this would be a pretty cool feature is if you could like claim your like network of Google accounts basically so if like I could have a personal Google account and then Branch under it like okay this is my personal account
this is my work account these are my whatever blah blah blah blah blah um and then I if I buy premium I want it to give it to all of them I don't want to see YouTube ads I don't want to open a YouTube uh YouTube video that I need to watch for work in my work browser thing and then get an ad and go GH and copy the URL and bring it over to my personal browser watch okay watch it there and it's the same with YouTube music that was actually what Adam was talking about how if he's YouTube music and YouTube
must be logged into the same account on the browser you can't be like yeah I have music here and I have this there oh so annoying so he has to open YouTube music in Edge so he can be logged into two separate accounts um you can also use I think um Brave has really good support for multi-g gooogle accounts across uh different things or you can use incognito mode there's other options technically most of them do like even even Firefox does Firefox is is just clunky compared to chrom's Chrome has
extremely good and easy to use multiac account stuff um like profiles and Firefox has them as well it's just not as clean um people are saying it's great maybe I just wasn't good at it I don't know dude I just other people are saying it's clunky I don't know it is what it is I wouldn't care about anything to do with YouTube music I would accept everything that's kind of crappy about YouTube music in a heartbeat if they brought back quick painless casting to my Sonos stuff but ever since Google
and Sonos got at it that's gone it was perfect in Google Play music it was literally perfect on the on the player page there was a cast button like how a cast button works and then it would just bring up the popup for what you want to cast to and you would go this one this one this one and this one and press go and it would just oh my gosh this is incredible and then it would just go I need to stop I need to stop using this phone but it's it's so tedious switching phones mine's below the
table well it was happening when it was above the table too I'm just going to put it under my thick juicy thighs nice that should block it thanks Taylor it immediately stopped it's a lot of water what can I say like no joke the second he put his  over anyway um dude I've been hitting the stair Master lately and the rowing machine dude the these thighs are getting firm they're they're getting to be firm thighs yeah I I actually like go to the gym now he's never going to get me to
lift anything cuz it's just like you lifted things it's not what did I lift your body that counts what the stair Master oh I mean yeah sure uh oh dude stair Master's a real I've never been on a StairMaster before St Master's that's a real workout man dude like I've been meaning to send you like pictures of what the machine looks like when I'm done one time like dude I'm in there I'll do like half an hour of cardio um and I I can't do one thing like at the at the like go hard like
level that I want to do it for the full 30 minutes that I like to do but you know my thing where I like to do 30 minutes cardio like every dayish I I try to do every day but it doesn't happen every day U so the thing that I've been so the thing I did the other day was I hit the uh the rowing machine for 10 minutes then the is this that the smash gym yeah then the bike for five do they have the cleaning stuff yet yeah okay then the StairMaster for 10 and then finished off with another five on the
bike so the in 30 minutes the the 40 o bottle I had drained two of them to give  yeah insane yeah that's nuts I I'll I'll go to the gym and I I tend to go for like a while like I for for whatever reason I'm not really into like the when I'm doing weights I'm not really into like the 30 minute workout I like going for like quite a quite a bit of time um and there will be like there will be some chick on the stair Master when I walk in she's like not moving that fast but she's on
the stair master and I'm noticing like I'm close to wrapping up my workout like an hour and a half later and I'm walking I'm like she's still on there like what the hell oh my God like I would fall over there's no there's no possible way it would not happen I could do it at a low pace for a long time but um I I don't know what the settings point is probably like two hours I don't know what the settings are equivalent to but um I'm trying to think like what's the what's the what's the pace that it's at
I'll have to check sometime but it's it's at 16 whatever that is I that's going to be machine dependent probably yeah so I I forget how many stairs per minute it is but it's oh dude it's a lot it's painful it it hurts a lot okay what else we got here some someone said I would like to hear more about Luke's Fitness habits as a fellow lifter I'm trying to get a flow plane exclusive oh yeah that would be cool where we get a bunch of not me but a bunch of different of the people
including myself uh but a bunch of different people at the company that that like to gym often uh to do like a a round table discussion thing we film for flow plane cool I think that'd be pretty sweet cool none of it's none of us are like I'll participate trainers or anything that'd be cool I don't I oh wait well does it count if it also includes like badminton stuff I think so I don't know like can I just to me I think it's just like a fitness discussion I think dude I had a I think
it' be neat I like did not realize how hard I destroyed myself yesterday because I wasn't in the gym gym I was I was playing badminton but what I did was uh we played a format called box game and  wife my goodness anyway uh box game um makes the in front of the service line is out and behind the double service line is out so it's like a shortened court and typically you play on a half court so it's a little bit wider than half of a singles court because you use the doubles line and you play directly
across from each other directly across from each other or diagonally or diagonally but I'm playing a format with Ivon help even things out cuz I'm a bit of a stronger player than her um where she takes half a court right half half a box and I take a box that is the entire width of the singles cord on the other side so I put on a 20b weight vest yesterday and I played that against her with dude I could barely emerge from my bed this morning I destroyed myself I am in so much I'm in so much pain today
like it's it's actually awful there's yeah there's a certain level where it's like okay that might have been good but it might not also be worth it well it's hard cuz when I'm having fun I don't I don't realize I don't notice yeah I'll sometimes get in a Zone where like I I don't register the level of strain properly and then like the next morning or that night I'll be like I'm really tired and then I'll be like oh yeah raidon man says pain is weakness leaving the BS no sometimes it's just sometimes it's
just overdoing it um we've got one here that is why can't I just plug a usba to a usba and transfer files between computers there's a lot of security reasons for that I don't think we'll include that one um I mean there are some good points here you can plug in a phone which is just a portable computer and copy files from that but but also I don't know I'm I'm sure there's I'm sure there's reasons for that I'm sure there's reasons for that uh Google Gemini just in general okay that's too broad Adam I
don't know if we'll do that either but Google Gemini replacing Google Assistant can't do 80% of assistant functions but  Sheets yeah and I can't I I okay I admittedly I haven't dug too deep into this but it switched to a default male voice and I don't know I just don't like my phone talking to me in a male voice mine I had um I did this whole Gambit like years and years ago where I set up a .co.uk email address to get like a specific voice for oh just to get like a British
like a sexy briti thought it would be like cool that wasn't really even the goal I just thought it would be like neat um and then yeah it changed it I was like that's annoying I don't even it doesn't really matter that much it's just weird I don't know all right let's uh maybe jump into our second topic no we have to a second topic I'll do a quick one okay Dan My Hero Let's Go My Hero yes my guy Terry will be featured on Canada's $5 bill okay this is not really Tech related but
we have talked we have talked about the actual rightful king of Canada Terry Fox before on this show he is a he's a Canadian hero uh and the only reason he's only a Canadian hero is because most of the world doesn't know about him if you don't know who Terry Fox is go read about him he's actually the most coolest wholesome awesomest most inspiring guy like ever um and he is finally finally going to be in his rightful place on our money damn it uh so he's going to the $5 note um the
process of replacing Wilfred laer began almost five years ago apparently and the Bank of Canada got more than 600 submissions to their open nominations for the honor they made the right choice yeah after losing part of his right leg to cancer uh Terry embarked on his marathon of Hope an attempt to run across Canada on his prosthetic leg raising money for cancer research his run was tragically cut short in 1981 but he was still able to raise $24.7 million that was a dollar for
every person living in Canada at the time yeah since his death annual Terry Fox runs have been held all over the world and have raised another $800 million for cancer research that's Canadian dollars unfortunately but still it's a lot of money not a ton of amazing news coming out of Canada over the last little while yeah this is cool this is cool we're finally doing it properly um and putting Terry on the money so that's good yeah it's finally time uh okay fine we'll explain merch messages Dan merch
messages are the way to interact with the show you can have your merch message pop up there you can have it go to what the you can have it go to producer Dan who will reply to it uh he might forward it to someone internal to better address your question or he might curate it and it will go to me and Luke to reply to you live on the show Dan do you want to show the fine people out there how it wakes sure hey D question for Linus primarily you've mentioned before that you like to see employee candidates
personal projects what are some of the coolest projects you've seen oh dude I haven't been a job interviewer in like years and years Luke's probably seen some cool stuff though Sean's home lab was sick that was cool yeah Our IT guy yeah um uh if I remember correctly Nick Harris had some cool stuff I remember someone showed me a cool Plex server at some point but they like cobbled together it was like very janky and I was like I've had a surprising amount of like software Dev applicants that you
know would just have nothing to do with anything to do with Hardware here show me their like computers or home servers or whatever just like you know I I I often get into those types of questions like what kind of stuff are you into and then you know it'll it'll naturally lead to showing into those things um had some really cool software projects the um the first this was this was way too tough of a project we've significantly toned it down since then but the first developer
hiring wave that we did for float plane do you remember this the game make us a game that was way too big of a ask it was also way too open-ended we we were did not know quite what we were asking of people at the time but um the developer that did get hired and is still with us um uh from from that wave um we we basically asked make us a game and then we listed like some things that would be cool for it to have um I don't remember the exact details and they made what was essentially like PVP asteroids
and it had a chat I remember that set up some notification thing so he would be able to know when I connected to it so when I jumped into it it's supposed to be PVP asteroids he also jumped on and then we like fought against each other and were able to talk in the chat and I was like whoa okay that's pretty cool we have some people who work here who are like probably too good yeah what can I say I say Luke's a great boss yeah thanks for sticking with me oh man um but yeah I don't know yeah
someone's like I want to play that now it was genuinely entertaining oh yeah I you showed it to me I tried it it was really fun was pretty sick it was like super fun um hey Rod piping up in the chat he says some freaking amazing people heck yeah rod rod knows a lot more of the team than most average float plane viewers would because he's come up and hang out hung out with us a few times Rod you're coming up for softball night this spring right I know it's a little early it's December still but you're
going to come join us for at least one softball night right I want to commit I want a commitment today I'll make it out let's see it yeah you better he says for sure all right heck yeah Rod still probably can't bat or throw properly but I'll make it out for those of you who don't know Rod is uh was uh on the BS Mods episode of scrapyard Warriors He's an incredible PC modder and has been a long time uh just sort of awesome supporter of the show I didn't remember this I don't know if it made it into the
cut because I haven't finished watching the video yet uh but we did is that me no it's you uh we we did Nick um from Creator Warehouse we did Nick lights AMD ultimate Tech upgrade recently and he reminded me of the time that we had to get seven Gamers one CPU to CES for a sponsor and the only way for us to get it there safely was to drive it down to Bob and Rod BS mods in Seattle and Nick took it down there and then they took it down to CES for us because they were driving to Las Vegas
cuz they had all of their system mods for all their sponsor so I had totally forgotten about that that was that was the early days when everything was like just like get her done by any means necessary it was it was in the trailer wasn't it or something something I don't remember cuz I remember I was telling someone this story recently but I couldn't remember why I went down there but I took a train down there to pick up the the old SUV which is probably what Nick dropped it off in oh that was a
piece of crap oh yeah it was a little rough I still remember when I realized on the highway that it didn't have AB ABS I still remember my parents telling me what great condition it was in when we bought it from them anyway never buy a car from a family member all the other company vehicles have lasted a long time well yeah because like I picked them any who um oh it's not Nick light as opposed to like Nick full fat or whatever it's Nick Li ght it's his last name yeah yeah it's
definitely not the opposite of wait  um oh what are we supposed to be doing oh yes good Nick dark no not that either just Nick light oh dude man I made I made the funniest jokes about about Nick light I was like I don't need a I don't need a filming light cuz I've got two lights when he was like holding his baby you should have seen High School oh yeah okay yeah a lot of light jokes yeah can I get a light you know okay it doesn't matter if I remember correctly there was NOP no I'm not going
to use names but there was someone else's name that went well with it that's all I'll say all right oh no way yeah it's finally here I yeah introducing the chocolate no wait sorry introducing the backpack rain cover you should all know it's always best to protect your load especially when things get really wet outside seriously that's the marketing Spiel that's why we designed this rain cover for your LT backpack this is one of the times that size really does matter okay so it's on
purpose so it's on purpose since most rain covers are not big enough to accommodate the sheer girth of the LT backpack is this you now is this in the writing or you just doing it's not in there okay it's an extra layer of protection to keep your stuff dry while also adding visibility to your bag in the dark with a snazzy mountain landscape inspired reflective design genuinely looks really sharp it also packs neatly into a zippable carrying case that you can attach to your bag's
Carabiner or accessory loops and is now  so durable that was a surprisingly long project to get the costing and the quality and the reflectiveness right and the printing quality and the just oh my god um anyway are you looking for a last minute gift it's never been a better time to purchase an LTT Store gift card for that special LTT enjoyer in your life why because nothing says I didn't leave this to the last minute better than an excuse that you had to wait for the brand new LTT
commuter backpack to launch the day after Christmas since that's why you got them a gift card and not an actual gift yeah so cover your ass at lmg doggn not a last minute gift Yeah question that you might not know the answer too I see there's a pull thingy on this I don't know if they can see it very well yes uh would this fit on the commuter uh I doubt it but we can find out it's probably a little big for the commuter probably a little big it was designed before the commuter was was like a
sparkle in the eye of our designers like it we actually started on the rainfly or the rain cover um I think almost immediately after the launch of the backpack so like it's been a while already said it would to The Forum oh hey no no I got my computer bag on me we can check it right now we can have a look um are are you going to fix that link that link broky oh apparently the linken link the Link's broken okay so um yeah the link is not broken okay so now I just got to find out if there's two
layers on the rain cover someone get me  knife the Link's working fine dude I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend this too loose yeah this is this is not is this is like clown level maybe in a in a pinch situation but don't buy it for that don't buy it for that at all not even in a pinch no pinch um it's not for that now oh no I mean like if you have both bags and you just need something and you already have the cover anyways like you could use it but you shouldn't buy it for that reason just take your
other backpack yeah oh yeah I just I just wouldn't no no I don't like it um so we'll we'll work on a rain cover for the commuter bag eventually now that we have a good supplier for them and now that we've got like got most of the hard stuff out of the way we've got good printing quality and everything it shouldn't be too much work for us to to get on something um okay also flow plane announcing Ivon week we're supposed to watch a video his wife my wife oh wow what they got her to do this look at
the look on her face you can tell exactly how thrilled she is about being dressed up as Burger King um that is the closest resemblance I think uh wow okay well um sorry Burger Queen excuse me sorry sorry my bad um oh I do want to mute that first sorry my bad one sec uh where where did I put it wait she's in the thumbnails of all the oh that's really funny I didn't put that together they replaced me in all the thumbnails here I was like she hosted the fer electric Ram video no she

gfp exclusive very cool all right there that's all the announcements we are done with announcements Dan sure you want to show us how merch messages work we already did one but let's do another one how about that sure hi LDL I'm going to be setting up my very first Nas yes I'm considering hexos I just want to set up a system to manage my Linux isos has there been any update to the issues we've had with Plex um I have found that downloading is a little better uh in general I I have found it to be a little
improved they have not addressed all of the issues that I kind of laid out as my requirements for us to work with them in an official capacity again I still am a Plex user but I I won't do sponsored stuff with them until they actually fulfill all the like stuff that bothers me about the software that was part of what I supposedly have as a lifetime  yeah cool it is what it is it is what it  now uh CH asks do you transcode down on download that's the part that really sucks yes that's exactly the point I
don't want to copy full-size files onto my phone for like the plane or whatever I want to put like like 320 kilobit or whatever per second like just the crappiest possible thing as long as the audio is listenable because I'm just like I'm on a plane I don't care I don't want it to take up a ton of space on my phone I'd rather have a bigger library to pick from especially if it's for kids or whatever so they can sort of browse and stuff they're not going to care yeah well they'll care about the
library they quity especially video quality everyone cares about audio  point oh it says two more topics Dan doesn't talk to to us anymore he just puts paper on the monitor I don't blame him honestly we're awful I mean do you want me to yell at you more I can yell at you more you can yall let me know you want I'm into it I thought you were still doing the the uh merch message no I'm done that's all I have to say about that do we talk about gaming industry stuff coffeezilla do it coffeezilla
known for his investigative videos on scam topics including crypto related scams released a video going after the csgo gambling scene I think we all knew it was in just an amount of time until that would happen uh in the in the video coffeezilla says that he was paid an embarrassingly low amount of money by csgo Empire a csgo gambling site to investigate their competitor csgo role oh so you just put csgo in then anything after it uh for scamming users in the csgo gambling scene coffee then decided
to flip the script denying the offer but still making a multi-part series I'd like to interject for a second here um what were they thinking yeah really dumb drawing attention to their whole grift and their whole deal by involving coffeezilla in it like there's so many things so many things going on in the crypto World they they could have just let him focus on radar like forever and they could have just done their skins and their gambling and their holographic whatever Damascus not paid we didn't
wait yeah offer he was offered to be paid sorry sorry sorry yes he didn't take the offer did I not say the denying their offer part it doesn't matter the next line it doesn't matter the point is I will clarify they made an offer to pay him to investigate their competitor he didn't take it potentially the next line was coffee then decided to flip the script denying the offer um so it was yeah it was just it shouldn't have said paid in the first part uh but still making a multi-part series about the
csgo gambling epidemic uh that uh that for a ton of you watching thanks for a ton of you watching the  tries anyways we really like him he's kind he's a kind person there's an Elijah note here as well that says YouTubers have been getting in trouble since at least 2014 uh I mean this is probably since YouTube existed uh people just don't care anymore it has become so accepted in our society it's crazy this is a literal multi-billion dollar industry that so few people even know
about but like coffeezilla highlights in the video it's really dangerous to try and go after these companies as they will literally hire Hitmen and riers okay wow that sounds like a interesting video to watch yeah this is uh this is sort of to go along with um to go along with Elijah's commentary here this is such a great question why why was this a slap on the wrist legally speaking and why has everyone just kind of like forgotten about it forgotten that these that these
two people were pretending to gamble on a site that it turned out that they owned they claimed to have a sponsorship but actually they owned it no Financial settlements no fines no jail time as they promoted this this gambling site that they owned and were pretending to  miners what yeah wacky um the same week award-winning indie game batro which is a Rog likee poker game but with no actual gambling uh well just it's fine just read the thing it it got an 18 plus rating for includ
including gambling elements it's got Roulette in it yet games that wait what I know but the the Pokemon game has a casino in it yeah Pokemon Blue has a casino in it yeah calm down yet games that have actual AA mechanics with actual money tied to them continue to be rated 3 plus for example uh EA Sports FC is is a three plus rated game that you can like buy I'm assuming you can buy some form of like uh card opening thing for their uh what is it called loot boxes yeah no I know not loot boxes but
I think you get like player cards and you use them in their like pro league thing or something I don't know who cares I don't play it so yeah whatever I they don't I don't need to contribute to their billions and billions of dollars yeah you buy FIFA points to open card packs just have none of these people heard of a rogue like team there we go yeah um discussion question how do you think the games industry is able to skirt around traditional gambling laws I don't know I genuinely have no idea
we've been talking about this the whole time I don't understand it it doesn't make any sense to me I mean that whole thing with Syndicate I remember talking about it on W show at the time 100% cuz like this was this was one that like kind of I don't know it felt closer to me than huge at the time because because I know the guy like I've met him a couple times I think and I'm just like I've I've actually run into him since then and I just like had no idea what to say because I'm just like how are you still 
yeah dude and I hate to like you know pull an Ellis for narcissist and make this about myself but are you kidding me the kind  took maybe you should have gone harder maybe that's maybe that's your lesson maybe I should have rug pulled a crypto coin yeah and people and instead people have been like that guy yeah maybe that should just be my stick maybe I should do it every six months and then nobody would B an ey lus coin dude should have done it should have done it next question is
do you think the rating on latro is fair it technically has gamble elements even though there is zero monetary G it's a Rog light no it's not fair dude like oh man like I sort of maybe understand I do but you got to have consistency in the enfor that's the big problem if it was just balatro that got hit by this which it is that's a problem if it was like everything that has gambling elements gets hit then it's like okay well that's that's a different thing uh because I could totally see
someone getting into batro is Blackjack based right poker no poker based it's made up sort of yeah but it's based on poker basically yeah um so I could see someone getting interested in real poker based on and then probably getting really bored brings up an excellent point in the chat tyan from Creator Warehouse who if he's still at work before you leave do you mind bringing us an update for mayor MC cheese here on the uh bit holder just if you could bring over the the the the finished one
he's being super oh is he not here anymore okay I'll go get it later then okay MC cheese chill stop being cheesed um tinan brings up a good point by that logic is rolling a die to see the damage you hit not gambling then I think no my reason I there's lots of dice games boys my reason for this is that oh is there any dice game that's specifically based on that though that isn't just D and D cuz like batro is specifically based on poker I don't know I don't know every dice game but I do
know that just like rolling Dice and seeing if you win said craps is 100% gambling it's a it's like a gambling game you just you just you just dice yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah either way quite literal actual gambling being rated as 3 plus while batro is 18 plus is just bad yeah that's not good I haven't tried batro apparently it's phenomenal it's like one of the best Rog likes ever made I like it does matter that it's lot of other people like it but I like it okay finally getting my kids into
cards yeah we just we just never did it we just like never played cards we've uh We've sat around and we've had like family Hearts night twice this week um have you ever played Hearts I like hearts yeah oh I love hearts hearts is fun it integrates a lot of the cool things about like card games in person I think it's a nice uh it's a nice mix of luck and strategy yeah because the rounds or not the rounds but the game is long enough that if you're a good player you can give yourself a much
better chance to win but obviously a little bit of an element of luck is fun I also like the card passing um yeah the card passing element and the strategy involved in that if it didn't have card passing honestly it just wouldn't be anywhere near as good of a game no that's a hugely important part yeah no I uh no and and it's been it's been really interesting to see how super like hyper engaged the kids have been with it like they I'm like hey do you guys want to do you want to do hearts night after the
first night it's like hey do you guys want to do like hearts night and they were like immediately at the table nice clean up the table we got some really nice cards we went to Hidden wonders again um local magic show absolutely phenomenal if you live in the Vancouver area or if you're visiting soon and you haven't been to Hidden wonders it's pretty great take your hand okay just bring it like watch this just put it right here and then was pretty good like that okay because you're doing yourself
a disservice go to Hidden wonders um the point is I bought some of his cards cuz he claimed sure and I would never trust a magician but he claimed that they were the best playing cards in the world I love them so I was looking for an excuse to play with them sure so we went last weekend so anyway I was so so anyway afterwards I was like hey do you guys want to play do you want to have like hearts again they were like cleaning up the table keep our Cs and clean getting ready like
abolutely stoked on it and uh yeah it was blast I used to when I was considerably younger my my best friend's family would bring me out fishing for like two weeks in the summer which was awesome we'd camp and fish and it was great and one of the things that like the the boys would do at night was was play Hearts yeah and it was awesome it was very fun n says get them into crib it's great for Math and Counting skills it is I find cribbage to be a little bit luck-based for me to enjoy it as much as
I enjoy Hearts um we we I played a my my grandfather loves cribbage and so I I would play that with him when I was a kid and uh it was it was pretty cool getting to see my my eldest and um learn to play it with him like we went over and we kind of like learned to play with my grandfather and um it got to the point where I could be like kind of helping in the kitchen and and they  but I can't say I enjoy crib as as uh as I enjoy Hearts my main issue with hearts I also love presidents and uh
that's that one's a lot of fun with the big group my main issue with hearts is you got to have four players yeah can't have five can't have three y um oh yeah Binky draws says Bluff is a great game to play if you have a bunch of incomplete decks uh yeah we um we call it cheat that that's that's what I always knew it as if you play cheat cheat or Bluff or is it's also called I don't think so um it's it's not as much fun with a small group but with a big group like probably five to eight
I would say would be your your optimal group size and then you play with a couple of decks um Bas you claim how many of a card you have is it that game and you put them down face down yeah I've never played it but I've heard of it it's a lot of it's a lot of fun if you've got if you've got a like a a good vibe and uh and people are kind of a high energy State cuz it gets really ridiculous because there are wild cards plus if you got two decks you'll get people making just utterly wild claims like 11
Kings and you'll be like cheat you pick it up like holy like six Kings and five wild cards like oh okay and then when you when you call it and you're wrong you pick up the entire discard pile and bring it into your hand so when you've got like two decks and someone gets a couple add calls wrong they've got like 48 cards in their hand they could have anything at that point yeah the I think that's called a bunch of different things um and you can play it with like dice or or
I I think I think people do it with like serial numbers on bills and like all this other type of stuff yeah cheat cheat's a lot of fun um soop Cannon says Uno is fun I've only played Uno once I what yeah I unironically agree Uno is actually a super fun game um and it's like I think maybe it gets a bad rap for being kind of like for kids or whatever it's basically Crazy Eights we just never had it yeah it's Crazy Eights but there's like more there's like more cards and the cards are tailored for the
game rather than just being a standard playing card deck yeah yeah yeah um yeah Uno's actually like unironically a great game buy giant Uno decks one of my biggest problems actually with Uno is buying the first party cards they suck oh really the quality is so low like it's it's low enough that it that it impedes my enjoyment of the game wow it's like it's hard to deal them consider a they're sticky like and I'll I'll take a brand new deck out of the box and they're like they kind of get
stuck on each other and like they just suck I don't remember them being like that when I was a kid Uno cards didn't suck and so um yeah Yellow Jacket Zack says I have vintage ones that are probably older than me and you know what they're probably way better quality cuz when I was a kid I don't remember them having costed them down so much like it sucks to see stuff that used to be good um Steph dut says Phase 10 is the same issue where the cards suck now I've never I've never heard of Phase 10 I
don't know what that is but yeah just come on man I just I want quality stuff that lasts how how much is that to ask apparently a lot apparently a lot yeah um yeah crystal says they didn't used to suck but they change distributors or something it's like well they then they shouldn't they should find a good one and just ah yeah anyway we used to play the the main board game that we used to play was called Malarkey oh yeah have you heard of malery before can't say I have I don't know if it's like still a
game that's sold but this is like the exact box that it was on its Wikipedia so I doubt it oh thank you this game malar has a trivia game that incorporates bluffing and into the game play and it was it was super cool because you would so everyone would that's Canadian AF is it is it a Canadian game I don't know um you would get handed out cards yeah and one person would get a thing that just is like figure it out you're going to have to like make up a lie and everyone else
will get facts and then it's like about a thing oh that sounds similar to balder dash where you are given a word that people are unlikely to know what it means oh you have to say the definition and you have to make up so it's super similar to that yeah and then you have to like sell your thing and why it's correct and man it was like it was pretty fun yeah that that those types of games are a ton of fun yeah um do you remember this I don't know if anyone else remembers nightmare the board the video board
game um I feel like I've heard of this it was so this frame for sure oh apparently it was called atmosphere somewhere else well it was called nightmare in North America and it had this like the it had these creepy like video VHS tapes that would go along with that would go along with it uh yeah here's the uh what $350 are you kidding me no no no here's one for 60 bucks nightmare the video board game dude I would I would totally play this I would totally I would totally play
this thing hold on nightmare I I bet it sucks but I played this with my family like a bunch of times when I was a kid why am I on cfra oh Canadian French well whatever I'll deal with this another time but yeah nightmare is it any good you're going for it tonight uh is what any good nightmare yeah I don't know I I I don't remember I was probably like nine or whatever when I played it so who knows um all right what are we supposed to be doing oh shoot Dan's gone um um sponsors no we can't do it without right
another topic the FTC is Banning hidden fees from hotel and ticket prices new rules set to take effect in April of 2025 will require upfront disclosure of the final price of hotel stays vacation rentals and live event tickets before you reach the checkout first proposed more than a year ago the rules Target Resort convenience and service fees that are often used to covertly increase profits the fees are still allowed the new rules just mean that they must be disclosed earlier in the process and
that the total price must be displayed more prominently than most other pricing information shipping fees and taxes however are not subject to the new rules though they must be disclosed before payment info is collected from the customer I wish taxes were our discussion question is can someone point the FTC at ticket scalpers next yeah really yeah no kidding I don't I don't we'll we'll see what the FDC keeps doing now that lenina Khan's out yeah rip Lena KH because this is a Lena KH era thing

just like whatever and just read right through it the like yuy smart camera thing do you remember that there's uh with your what was it your tainting balls or [Laughter] whatever oh it was so good um for those of you in San Diego who are upset it's an anchor man reference it's not I don't actually I don't actually care enough about the city of San Diego to have feelings about it I mean which maybe is worse I don't know who knows oh no it was good I don't have the link anymore I had the link when we were
doing the topic but we didn't end up getting into it for whatever reason but it's it's it's a very funny clip um okay okay Dan hit us hi lenus I was had to hear that the tall Wan V3 hoodie was off the table what's the minimum order for it to make sense I have a Silicon Valley money uh how many do you  buy oh man investors uh okay I like you you're cool I mean h here's the thing minimum order on something like a full custom designed hoodie can be a little bit all over the place because it
depends on how many um embellishments you're getting that are like custom sourced so let's say you're getting a custom draw cord or you're getting like a custom zipper pull or you're getting a like custom this custom that depending on whether it needs to be injection molded or depending on whether it's machined or depending on who the supplier is and what your negotiated terms with them are it can be all over the place but if I was to say if I was to give you a rough number of how many
we would need to produce of a hoodie like a a quite custom hoodie like the W hoodie I'd say somewhere in the "neighborhood of 2,000 to 3,000 units so" that's for all the sizes combined well it's complicated right because depending on whether your limitation is a custom dyed roll of fabric or whether your limitation is how many you have to buy of some weird carabin or zipper pull or whatever it is uh that can impact it so if if the limitation is fabric well you can get around it uh that's one of the
ways that we're able to do so many different prints of the underwear because we can make onesies out of them and we can go through a bunch of the fabric by doing onesies um and that's the reason why I'm trying to think of um of something that was quite limited by um by a custom thing instead I I can't think of anything off the top of my head but there's areas where you can kind of you can kind of account for that in your product mix um by by using it here so that you can just do a few you know of
that kind of fun underwear pack or whatever so so so what I'm trying to say is it's all over the place but in general for a custom hoodie I'd say somewhere between let's say two and "3,000 units to get a run done all right" so AC oh yeah right so I was going to say another thing is sizing so if you think that it's a design that's going to skew quadruple XL then you don't have to produce that many of them to use up like a custom die lot a fabric for instance so back to WAN hoodie Wan hoodie tends
to skew pretty standard for for our seze miic so we'll probably go from I think small tole XL on that one don't quote me on that because I don't remember exactly but here's the issue we don't have a tall hoodie um we don't have our tall hoodie grading done yet and Grading refers to um the process of taking your reference sample which is often created as a medium um because I'm deeply involved in the development process and I like to be able to try it on in order to give feedback and also because medium
is the best selling size obviously because that's why it's medium um so we have other mediums try them as well to make sure that it's not just made for me but we we start with a medium and then grading is the process of taking that medium and building it up and building it down to accommodate different sizes the issue is that we don't have our grading done for a tall hoodie it also means that we would need to figure out ahead of time what our mix would be when we order these thousands
of hoodies so across our sizes let's say we go small medium large XL double XL triple XL that's six if we add tall sizes right we just doubled our skew count which is brutal okay then we have to make sure that we get the mix across all those different sizes in the regular and the tall variant we have to make all of that fit into some reasonable order quantity let's say you know let's say 2500 units for something like that then we have to also balance that with that if we absolutely completely
flub one of them it's going to be out of stock for like 6 to 8 months while we wait for a restock stock of all the little bits and Bobs that go on it and production and shipping it is a lot to manage from a logistic standpoint and I think that often people do not consider or they don't have experience with how difficult Inventory management can be the number of times that we've had people say why don't you just have an EU Distribution Center so I don't have to pay as much on
shipping when I'm kind of sitting here going yeah we you think we didn't think of that we thought of that but now I get "to take that let's say a 3,000 unit" order because I can sell more because I have tall sizes and I have better "shipping to the EU I now take that 3,000" unit order I have to get the seze mix right and then I have to nail I have to nail many might be different course it will and so then I have to nail how many of them I send to our EU Distribution Center or to our na Distribution Center
or you're going to end up paying more for shipping anyway because we're going to be out of Smalls in Europe where people walk everywhere and we're going to be out of trip xxl's in the US and it's like crap so now all we have is an inventory management nightmare because you got to understand we're a small company still in the grand scheme of things we are not Unico yeah we're not Lululemon we aren't producing a style on "the order of you know 50,000 units in" one shot we're not doing that yeah we're
"making maybe 2,000 units so splitting" that across all these distribution centers is just it's not it's not feasible for us right now not at our current operating scale and I know it's easy to say well your operating scale would probably be better if you guys accommodated larger sizes and if you had multiple distributions be careful though yeah but how much investment do I want to take I will say I will say do I want to take VC money do I want that to impact our product development and the
way we run our business we don't want to do that but I will say yeah the tall blank shirt is sold out in long and short sleeve in every single possible size that we have it's very very very strongly rated five stars the top review on it right and I'm going to cut Luke off I actually muted his mic I've muted your mic go I'm I'm going to cut Luke off right now because I have good news for you oh when we bring in our new colors of t-shirts which are coming soon I think we've got five new colors of
t-shirts I want to say they will be available in tall sizes oh that's cool so not just black but you got to give us time no that's awesome that's awesome I'm just I'm not I I understand it all takes time I'm just saying the most recent riew says please bring back more to the store I need 20 of them I know I'm aware I'm aware uh frostblade says yes um a lot of people underestimate how small LT is yes it's bigger than the twers coffee shop in my town but even a company like critical
role is maybe 10 XLT and even then they're small compared to something like a Mr Beast we are any Creator company is insignificant you know compared to the the the multinationals and honestly even then I see comments all the time that are like how can they not do this they have 100 employees it's like okay but do you have any idea how much stuff we do do we do so much St all of those people are incredibly busy it's not I actually don't know if critical role is 10 times our size I don't know how big
critical role is but I'd be pretty surprised that would be very surprising I I was reading the comment verbatim I mean how many people how many people work at critical role uh LC assume they're smaller but I don't know yeah I have no idea I mean they have like eight founding members so they they definitely have some stuff going on or something uh yeah does does anyone know like how many people work there I legitimately have absolutely no idea I'm over it uh okay what do you want to talk about next
about another merch message oh yeah right merch messages celebrating getting a new job at an AWS data center coming from it at a k to2 School District what are the biggest mindset shifts or skills  center we don't work at a data center uh oh critical R is about our size uh LinkedIn says um 50 to 200 people so they're they're somewhere in the same kind of neighborhood as us don't care cool nice uh what what exactly was they went they went from teaching and now they're working in a data center it from like
Elementary High School to working in ah okay so it a school to it for a school district I should say um man security yeah probably I mean there's a lot of privacy and security concerns in something like a school but Man compared to the stories you hear people telling about like man seriously going to um going to equinex and like hearing that there's cages that literally if anybody even touches the outside of them like they have touch sensors on them like the head of the head of security gets a call like
immediately it's like that's like that's wild yeah I feel like the stakes are going to shift like if if the TVs in the hallways of the school aren't receiving the thing that you're trying to send over them I'm sure somebody's going to be upset about it um but now you're working at a data center that is serving data for for any number of different types of businesses um and it's it's likely going to be a more intense environment I suspect I don't know though like again neither of
us yeah neither of us have worked in a data center um Dan Dan Danny says I had to get an FBI background check to get a tour of the switch data center here in Vegas yeah like that doesn't surprise me at all I've heard now you're working in the data center not the software development side I've heard the software development side of AWS is quite the the meat grinder when it comes to employees um so I don't know keep your head down Dan one more Yep last one hey dll I've had my backpack for one and a/2
years to which my kid and significant other both wanted one which are already under our tree would you ever sell LTT colored carabiners to help a family differentiate bags that is so funny uh do either of you have your LTT bag pack on you I do uh can I can I borrow yours for a second Dan do you still have your thing on it thing yeah the thing yeah the name thing yeah so here's our solution uh we gave them away at our Christmas party one year and um here hold on Linus cam there we
go we put um there we go we put little tags on them with little laser engrav tags with people's names because we did foresee that it was going to be a huge problem that literally everyone in the entire company had the same backpack all of a sudden overnight yep hasn't really helped really not really so uh my look at him I guess is to find some little That's Heavy you got some stuff in it I know I always do find some little embellishments or something to hang off of yeah to hang off of your poles and
help to differentiate your bag that's really that that's really all you can do I've got my dopamine Beaker and I've lost my little whale from LTX I still have the little gold chain but the whale has gone and I'm I've got a couple things on there the the float plane team went on a float plane so I have the like luggage tag from when we did that still on my bag um and I've got the the like uh morphologist the like architect staren guy he gave me a a pin for his like staren Clan or whatever it
is um and I have that on my bag so I think it looks cool mine is a Mighty Car Mods lanyard nice from our recent collab and then I also so have my little lus Sebastian thing I stole that from my full siiz backpack yeah mine's still on my full size and this is a snake um yes that my daughter made for me I'm I mean yeah it's kind of a snake snake like put a bird on it hold on she actually gave me a new thing that I might have lost uh oh bad dad uhoh oh shoot I might have lost the little
lizard she gave me well meat whoops is there anything important in there cuz you really flop it around oh it's it's all my screwdrivers oh yeah I have like five screwdrivers in there cuz I I put all my different bit sets in my different screwdrivers they're all colorcoded oh can I do a can I do a business pitch to you live on the show business pitch AKA a [Laughter] yeah can I do one of those sure yeah you can at me cool nice uh so open sauce was amazing and some of us are
going to go again just like regardless yeah um but I was thinking it's a maker event what if we had a make your own  Booth don't pitch it to me no no pitch it to pitch it to someone else because that is going to be a is it so what is it is it do the machines become a problem or like what what are the downsides here uh tinan is saying yeah I already kind of somewhat so there's a number of issues issue number one is getting the dyed Plastics there's minimum order quantities often
for getting dies so we cheated on a lot of the ones that we had for the make your own screwdriver booth at LTX where we were able to piggyback on top of the mega Pro red that they already are buying in bulk and we were get a little bit of it from them and some other colors they had a blue already that we that we borrowed uh there were a couple where we had to like buy too much D it goes bad which is like great like plastic gu goes bad like okay sure that sucks oh Titan says it's an excited e uh
I am not committing to anything um so there's make Mak sense there's then there's the like getting the production time for it because you're you're basically you don't know what you're going to make yeah so you have to make like extra of everything you're going to have a huge bin of garbage at the end of it essentially well we we made not really we made lemonade out of garbage because we made the mystery screwdriver the random color screwdriver so that's fine we got rid of it all that that's
okay we could solve that um but the other issue is transportation we have to carry we have no idea what we're going to make everyone at Open sauce might make an all orange screwdriver we don't know and obviously you can kind of run out of something but if you run out of like half of it that sucks that's that's that's taking a w and turning it into two L's you know like that's not that's not good did you come with that on spot or I no I've used it before but it is a me thing it's pretty good yeah take
taking taking a w and turning it into L's or taking two L's and turning them into a w I love it it's pretty good um so you got to so you got to carry a bunch of stuff down um so that's that's a real pain in the butt and and otherwise you know you have people show up at the booth and it's like oh yeah I mean this would be kind of cool you don't want right colors for me you don't want to create negative experi line now and there's none of this left um and then there's also the fact that that
would mean that instead of our cool team of cool people hanging out with other cool teams and cool people they're like Manning a booth which I don't know maybe you guys are super into it and you just want to work at a booth at Open sauce but like are you sure just all I'm asking is that you just think about it are you sure CU it's not something that I would that I would assign to people I wouldn't be like oh yeah that show that you really like attending how about you work at it they
want us going again anyways um so that's cool so we're going to have some amount of presence there regardless when it happens whenever the date is I don't remember Diego s says that's why you have employees duh I'm talking about the employees the the doesn't just roll down a hill indefinitely at some point somebody has to work what did you say l can do it I I'm I honestly somewhat agree with him I don't want to man the booth I don't want to do that part maybe for like a little bit I don't want to do
it for the whole time get volunteers to help no you guys don't understand what's so cool about the screwdriver Booth is you get to talk to the people who designed it what's cool about the screwdriver is that they like know it inside out and what's safe about the screwdriver Booth is we have people who are really familiar with the arbor presses and that can make sure that nobody squashes a finger and all that important stuff um yeah so I I I don't know I what I would rather do what I'd rather do in
the longer term or the medium term is figure out how to do like an Xbox controller configurator but for the screwdriver where you can just configure your own custom one online yeah that's where I'd like to get to but we are oh we can build the configurator no problem we even have a 3D version of it that's like semi made already have you seen that I think so actually the 3D hovering screwdriver in in any background environment you want tough yeah that part's way harder yeah for
sure because one of the big challenges is that we have to stock the entire ratchet assembly with the selector ring on it already if that were not the case it would significantly simplify the lead times of that part because we have to have the injection molding done here then we have to have it assembled onto the ratchet assembly in China then we have to have that assembly sent back over here for final assembly of the driver and handling that across like six or eight different colors or whatever
it's just like B it's going to mean that for extended periods of time you're going to have certain colors out of stock it's just it's a lot of logistics to manage when we're already having trouble keeping t-shirts in stock so and that doesn't mean that the team isn't smart and doesn't work hard or whatever it just means that the logistics of managing a store with like over a thousand SKS is is really tough it's also like if you if you look at customized versions of products on
stores I can think of a couple where like I don't know you can get your name etched onto it or whatever it's usually surprisingly not that cheap oh oh yeah oh 100% it's a lot oh dude we've got um we were looking at what the pricing would probably have to be if we ever did the resin infused wooden screwdriver or the sorry yeah the resin infused wood screwdriver and those screwdrivers instead of being like buying a resin infused wooden screwdriver you would probably buy that
one and it would probably be listed on the site for like 7800 $900 because realistically it would have to be like hand monitored like we would take that that piece of wood like that one and then we would probably do it here and it would have to be like hand assembled by someone on our engineering team as opposed to just some random or whatever because of still has to meet specs Etc yep and and the cost of of those things like it's like when you look at like knives and stuff that have this resin
infused wood and the handle and stuff "like that they're they're like $1,000" they because the the getting it is is really expensive on top of all the other complications making you can't get them at volume right um citizen 5391 says bespoke screwdrivers would go crazy for the whales I know I know I'm sure you could sell like five of basically anything oh yeah oh oh probably it's just a question of like it's it's balancing whether that would even be worth spending our time on like the
opportunity cost of it we also have this the whole thing with the store where we're we're trying to make something new and better and while it might be expensive it's really good and and it's that stuff it also has to be somewhat within reason expensive but reasonable yeah we had a $600 backpack but everyone who bought it was thrilled with the Luxe backpack because the materials are great it has all the functionality of the regular backpack and it's a head turner um like when I was daily driving the Lux
backpack dude I saw you get questions about it people are like wow what is that because not everyone's into it and that's totally fine but the people who like it like it like one of my friends in Taiwan like badon buddy tried to buy it off of me and I was like dude this is the only sample like I have to wear test it you can't he's like what's the what's the retail price I'll buy it for full retail price like dude look I would give it to you if I could it's not about the money you just can't have it it's the
only one that exists yeah um Top Gear asks have you guys surpassed a million screwdrivers yet stubby and full size combined no I think I think we're close "to 300,000 or so which is a ton which is" unbelievable yeah and I think our Shopify order number is over a million now but I don't think we actually have a million orders because there can be like cancellations and stuff oh that makes sense yeah so we're getting we're getting super close to a million orders through Shopify uh we we apparently are
actually like a very sizable like store for the Shopify platform which is something I never would have thought I never would have thought would happen citizen 5391 asks how's the gold controller doing it's doing great appreciating actually yes if anyone wants to buy it you could buy an appreciating asset I would be very open to selling it I don't actually have any kind of emotional attachment to it it's actually kind of annoying to use yeah it's not great to use it weighs so much it is it but it's
cool and you'll look cool in front of all your cool friends yeah if you wanted to um yeah if you wanted to I I don't even  it I'll engrave a little whale on it that's the Duke I'll engrave away wow okay how crazy would it be like to celebrate a million screwdrivers to do like a golden screwdriver or something like that I actually I don't know I don't even know if I don't even know if we'd have to wait that long I think that doing a golden screwdriver for like the metal screwdriver launch or something
like that would be kind of cool wait what Oh you mean to sell it no one's going to buy it no no no metal screwdriver launch I don't know what you're talking about um anyway what are we supposed to be doing Dan topics topics HP downgrades printer features when you don't buy genuine ink Accord to a post on r/ design an HP printer owner named Mitch had multiple features of his Deskjet 2700 removed or revoked because he lost his HP Plus benefits when he installed non-hp replacement ink in his
printer some HP Plus benefits include cloud-based printing automatic updates and fixes improved print quality Advanced scanning features extended warranty and enhanced security features now hp's version of this is that HP plus is a free upgrade available on many HP printers when you set up an HP account use genuine HP ink cartridges and keep your printer connected to the internet additional benefits include the optional HP instant ink oh so you pick a plan based on how
often you print not how much ink you use starting at 189 a month for 10 pages of that whole thing is that whole is that still a thing I guess see you don't get to just spin you know you can't just spin you can't say hey it's an upgrade if you do all this stuff no it's not it's a downgrade if you don't do all this stuff you have a gun to my head this is a stick not a carrot H H brutal $189 a month Q you not $189 oh you just Luke's on it in the chat just 100% believable I don't know
what to say about that other than yeah I was just like that sounds about right for HP brutal let's move on to our next one somebody found our geocache yeah at the end of Tuesday's video oh our original here we might as well we might as well show the uh hey they found it and they look exactly genuine Smiles exactly as wet as I would expect them to look look uh so that has a $500 LT Store gift card on it or something like that I think um so this was really cool at the end of Tuesday's video the most
expensive USB drive on Earth per gig we revealed that we had hidden that Ferro electric USB drive in a geocache somewhere in the Vancouver BC area with $500 of coupon codes on it and we left Clues throughout the video a flurry of activity in the comments our forums and Reddit followed and the device was found about 6 hours later near a geocache in Port C here is the solution if you uh if you don't want spoilers and you want to try to solve it for yourself by watching the
video you can totally do that um I'll put both hands up when you're good to tune in again there you go um first the video had four quarters of a QR code hidden in it Connor was responsible for hiding the QR codes and he determined the spots the time stamps are 502 543 643 is it's a single frame and 1012 in the outro once you assembled the pieces of the QR code it led you to a picture of a broken fence the fence was a rail fence which references the cipher used to encode the text surrounding the QR
code since the fence in the image had three rails so did the rail fence Cipher I added space and line breaks to the encoded message which makes things a bit more difficult I did not include an offset so here's an example of a rail  Cipher this Conor's idea cuz this was sick uh no I believe this would have been Adam working on this good job I had intended to have an extra step using another ciphered message within the rail fence Cipher the next hint would have been Liberty Freedom tyranny is dead a
line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar to indicate that the next code was using a simple Caesar Cipher A to B B to C C to D Etc even when only a portion of the message had two layers of encryption it made it very hard to know if you were on the right path Also I ran out of time to make it more complex so we didn't do that instead I just included the name of a geocache that could be found near where I stashed the drive to avoid too much disruption to the Geocache I didn't actually hide the drive inside of it
just nearby to get the exact coordinates you just had to solve the Geocache puzzle which I will not spoil here um Adam says I did my best to be hands off but did end up providing hints by reacting to comments on the forums when it seemed like people were getting really far off like thinking that we hit it an Enderby or started calling phone numbers Adam oh boy yeah okay that makes sense congrats to redditor Betty brat and her husband it was great to see the teamwork of the community many viewers
outside the Vancouver area we're helping out those who were close enough to have a chance at the prize we did manage to generate some mild controversy in the geocash community uh geocaches are created by community members and are meant to be done for the fun of it rather than for any sort of prize and introducing a bunch of normies to any hobby is usually met with a bit of resistance um as new folks might not understand the culture or best practices um some people did point out
that plugging in random USB sticks is a bad idea you don't know what's on it in this case I um I really doubt that someone was able to find it Flash the firmware program something malicious to put on the USB drive then put it back where it was supposed to be possible it is possible however very unlikely I'd also be surprised if someone decided to purchase similar looking USB keys with malicious stuff on them and litter them around J Cashes in the low Mainland um it's like needles and Candy Apples it's
not really a thing that actually happens except when does happen um so yes that is a really good point but it was also a very distinctive looking USB drive with very distinctive functionality like you yes good point it would have been tough but also very very unlikely the level of the level of gatekeeping that was going on with a couple of members of the geocash community was actually comical yeah um and you all need to calm down uh but yeah it was it was fun it was fun we had a lot of we had a lot of
fun with it and uh the team has a lot of fun creating content like that I saw a lot of people um that were angry about the sort of detective interrogation and like the lawyer conversational skit that took place in the video and anyone who said it wasn't their cup of tea I kind of noted that and anyone who got super angry about it is now officially shadowbanned from the channel forever because guys we got to we got to do stuff don't don't get mad just express your thoughts it's so exhausting
sometimes dude our comment section is legitimately it's getting better like way better I don't know whether it's the threat of Shadow Banning or or that it was just a very because I haven't actually done it to that many people or whether it was just a very small number that were creating as as V majority of the nonsense a lot of these are actually very small numbers like it's it's a lot of communities are are often ruined by a very small group of people yeah because it doesn't take much to taint the bunch
nope it really does and you know what I um I had an interesting conversation at the uh the smash Champs the Badminton Club at the smash Champs Christmas party I now have to attend multiple Christmas parties I'm running too many companies it's a very relatable problem I know um so we had a really interesting conversation because they finally dug up a data point that I'd been asking for and you know how I can never turn off work so we're at a Christmas party we're talking about work anyway the point is
that um because we've been offering it for free we've had free drop in for uh our soft opening there have been people who have been signing up and then not showing up because there's no consequences for not showing up and what we discovered that there was a group of repeat offenders who had done it over 30 times in a span of just a couple months that we've been soft open and so we were having a conversation about you know what what our reaction should be to something like that and uh the team I
want want to get out ahead of this the team already made their case and and and I gave in I gave in they said they wanted to give a warning to these people before issuing any kind of suspension or or anything like that but what I told them I wanted to do was just just permanently ban them forever because doing something like missing missing a book session once in a while that happens it's going to happen that happens y doing dozens of times over a span of 30 times over a span of a
couple of months yeah knowing that by booking the session somebody else can't sign up for it because it's a limited number of slots that just means you're a if they're going to do that what else are they going to do what else are they I just don't want them around you really want them on your course and here's the numbers 2.5% it was 2 and a half% of the total people who have come to play that we're engaging in this sort of egregious level of abuse of our online booking system and would you let people
appeal why yeah why yeah no why give me many times yeah that many times is tough because that means you spent a month in the how long two months how long it's been over so you spent half of the time since it's been open booking and not showing up so like you know maybe you have a slew of Unfortunate Events and you end up not making like a few in a row even and it like looks kind of bad you're like yeah like I just I wasn't trying to be a jerk I I thought I could go and then you know
just life is mess up right now and it just kept not working but spending a month out of two to two and a half months doing that is is too much yeah Chris 429 says honestly it's crazy that 2% of the time you've been open you couldn't rent that space that's crazy that's not how that math works the way the math works is that if you have 2 and 1 12% of the people of the people that have come and played doing this 30 plus times we would have sessions that are fully booked and have like a third
of the people there because two-thirds of them weren't there that's that's what this kind of egregious repeat offending does to a community it destroys it it yeah it actually yeah it makes it less interesting and when there's less people there it's less interesting yep cuz in my limited experience with batminton people you'll kind of jump the courts a little bit sometimes yeah absolutely go play with other people do whatever especially during drop in yeah it's it's very much a community thing so having
such a reduction in the amount of people that are there can be bad hafia says there has to be some Advanced payment for booking yes yes and once we once we're taking payment absolutely there will be but we're soft open and we wanted people to be able to come and try the courts and and enjoy some free binton I mean this is why we can't have nice things we we actually were trying to like do a solid obviously there's an advantage for our business right like we're we're getting we're giving people
that first that first hit you know um smash yeah the first first first smash  like yeah like I don't I yeah so obviously we're going to figure it out but no it was free so people were taking a free thing it's it's and and so like the 2% of people were showing up at the door where the bowl of candy is out please take just one and just taking all of them ruining it for everybody brutal um so yeah I don't know I just I I just my state of mind Ivonne disagreed she supported the smash team and you
know they ultimately have decided to issue a warning to all these people and even that there like a manual process it's creating unnecessary work for us to go and like tell them to not be a right like why so they're going to do it they're do it we're going to give them a warning or whatever but honestly I'm not I don't support that I think we should just not bother with I don't need them I'll take the other 97 and a half% of good eggs yeah because I don't think have intendance problem most people are
pretty awesome most people are pretty chill it just takes a so that that was what I thought was interesting it was that number 2 and a half% was the number of people who were just egregiously just jackes I bet you it's really not that far off for like most things yeah yeah genuinely yeah like looking at communities that I've modded before and stuff it's like or really a small sitting in a theater watching a movie it it's only it's only like two people that won't shut up or have their phone on or
whatever yeah apparently I was reading an article about this is this true apparently disruptions in movie theaters are becoming like way more of a thing yeah because people aren't used to not being on their phone so they'll just be on their phone the whole time what yeah that's crazy yeah and they don't do anything they don't just like kick these people out I guess not like that's the that's the thing that really blows me away because as the proprietor of the business I feel
like it's my job to ensure that my customers have a good time and I don't care about one person if they are impacting the other 99 that are not able to enjoy my facility I I I am wondering a little bit like I've heard this as well you've heard this I've heard this neither of us really go to movies that often anymore so we haven't experienced it is this we're all hearing about it or have people in the chat actually genuinely experienced this cuz like Elijah said uh yeah people cheering it's
so true people cheering sometimes also is this from Elijah going to the theater or are you hearing this there's no way Elijah ever went to a theater no way and Elijah says it's hard to kick people out it's a bigger disturbance to do that than to let them be annoying no no no no no that's the thing because you you only have to kick them out one time they will be a disturbance forever I go to theater once a month wow oh really well then why haven't you ever seen any movies what are you doing there modern 
man um maybe just theaters the staff is just a person for popcorn yeah dude I don't know as a movie goer and I used to manage one in the 2010s uh there's way more talking during the movie and phone usage than there used to be yeah okay Avid movie go oh okay yeah yeah   dude um okay I think that's because it's the new Lord of the Rings movie Conrad that's my take on it what is he said nobody goes anymore we went to go see the new Lord of the Rings movie and there's only five people there what new
Lord of the Rings movie is there a new Lord of the Rings movie I don't know which is the whole what are you talking about whole part of the problem there's no new Lord of the  no oh animated movie animated movie The War within oh I don't know if it's not not the war within the war of the rerum is is this cut off is this like actually based on anything Tolen wrote or is this just like going to have final season of Game of Thrones syndrome uh plot 183 years before the events it's
animated and not promoted well yeah this doesn't seem like a fair comparison necessarily o oof 11 and a half million box office on a budget of 30 million oh that's not that high of a budget though for an animated movie that's that's a high budget for a like not Pixar animated movie yeah ah okay like I don't know I don't know who the heck this is oh Peter Jackson's involved though interesting don't I mean animated movies don't do well you can't really say that because like inside out to was lowkey like huge
inside out two was good yeah also Mario movie like there there are yeah there are big big animated movies yeah the big ones do really well all right yeah I honestly had no idea there was this Final Fantasy 7 rebirth directors have asked fans Not to make inappropriate mods again they told the epic game store while the team has no plans for official in-game mod support we respect the creativity of the modding community and welcome their creators though we ask modders not to create or
install anything offensive or inappropriate Community developed mods can provide everything from bug fixes and quality of life features to entire expansion for games but can also add less wholesome content some PCR some pcmr members question if this is a genuine request or a clever way to market the game based on potential mod content and that's 100% what it is Luke seems to be luke seems to be on that side but I'll I bet the bank on it I'll say this if if this was um if this was Ubisoft I would agree with
you but it's not and the they've done this before this exact person I think has done this before okay and the results were exactly what you would expect sure and they're doing it again probably because last time it got a ton of press and a ton of people talked about how the game was modable and like oh my god of course there's going to be inappropriate mods T hooray and I'm sure they know the same thing's going to happen again what if what if there are potentially cultural
differences and this may genuinely be a case where they are just respectfully asking again knowing that nobody listened last time and hoping that someone will actually listen do you think that is possible I think it's possible yeah I I I I do agree that that's possible I think at the same time that if it if that is the case I hope that they realize that it is doing completely the opposite thing maybe they do maybe they don't but either way there "are currently over 1,400 mods to ff7"
remake on Nexus mods and at least a couple hundred of them are not safe for when yeah tinan asks could it be both yeah it could be it could be both it could be a little bit of both this particular individual or there could be members of the team that that really are actually offended by like I'm sure at least someone there doesn't like that those are happening and I'm at least desecration of their beloved characters and art and you know whatever else and I'm sure that at least someone else
there is seeing dollar signs and it's like wow this works really well last time I bet you we could do the exact same thing and the news media will do the ex exact same thing and it would be great and then that's exactly what happened revivers digital license plates hacked to dodge tolls and tickets I had no idea that these were a thing until I saw this in the wock stop it stop it okay okay okay okay okay okay so digital license plates with screens how is that legal who could have Poss
foreen that somebody would hack them and change what's on the screen nobody who could have who could have foreseen it so the the so the the the the topic here is all about what's happening with revivor digital license plates that is like completely besides the point for how do these exist how the do these exist how are they legal at all this is so oh my goodness dude you're not even allowed to put put like a piece of plastic film over top of your license plate here because it makes it more difficult for
the traffic cameras to photograph them yeah people do it anyway but technically you're like not supposed to who the thought this was a why what is even the point of it it doesn't even look that much different and it like would take some amount of energy it seems very weird to me like they're super cool like you can change the like outer you know a border of it like aity thing or whatever like yeah they're super cool I I can understand why somebody would want one oh that
unquestionably no doubt all the license plate flipping motorcycle people yeah definitely but how anyone in any kind of position of authority could look at this and go that's fine gee I don't think anything could go wrong with this what yeah it I was I was stunned here's what's going on somehow I don't I don't know how this happened attackers can replace the firmware on revor brand digital license plates which are currently installed on "65,000 Vehicles" attackers the new firmware allows an
attacker to change the number on the plate at will via a phone app potentially sticking other drivers with their tickets and tolls the hack may also enable users to access other plate features with without paying revivor monthly subscription fees which are apparently 35 uh oh okay uh $35 a a year yeah $35 a year why um why why why would I want to pay $35 a year well you don't want to which is why else for my license so revor says the hack voids the warranty and requires fancy
tools and rare expertise but researcher Joseph Rodriguez count that now that the hack has been discovered a bad actor only needs to plug in a cable and upload a new firmware yeah sounds about right revor plates will send a notification to the owner if they are detached from a vehicle so attackers may need to jam or overcome that feature in some way uh there's apparently no way for revor to update the software to prevent the jailbreak it is apparently in hardware and this is not the first time their
system has been compromised in 2022 vulnerabilities in revivor web infrastructure allowed attackers to gain administrative privileges on their backend database allowing the ability to track and change plates at will digital plates are currently legal to buy and register in California Arizona and Michigan wow our discussion question is I didn't know automated speeding tickets didn't exist there anymore what problems are being solved with a digital license plate nothing I don't understand its
point at all okay other than getting away with speeding tickets and tolls that I completely understand vanity themes but like is that even even what are you really allowed to do cuz like in the picture that we have it's just a super normal license plate no you can you can put like cute things on it anyway there's a is that any different than just like putting a sticker on your normal license plate dude I don't know custom Banner messages oh my God at $75 a year they limit how many custom
Banner messages you can put on it why why are you allowed to put custom Banner messages like that's is that not like distracted distracting driving dude how is that okay well no you would do that while you're not driving it can pay your tolls display Amber Alerts and track your location I think you can also use it for um uh you can use it for like anti- theft I don't think it can track your location they have a they have a statement specifically saying um revor reached out
with us with a statement saying that the license place do not have GPS capabilities okay maybe this is a different uh maybe this is a different startup then so I don't know what this is anyway okay yeah I don't know oh oh yeah revivor plates though don't come cheap out oh yeah did I mention the plates $500 if you want to give it a cool border buy a plastic one that have existed for a trillion years and if you want the little cool Banner things just put stickers on it sure thing Grandpa
shees shees I'm okay with being old if that's the line reboot rewind has started their crowdfunding campaign it's over Ron GoFundMe just wanted to promote this real quick cuz it's a super cool super cool Mission uh the the show reboot um was like kind of part of our our childhood especially here in Canada and the original tapes have been found but it's a lot of work to get them fixed so um I think we could I think we could probably throw a thousand bucks at it if you guys want to throw a little bit of
money at it um that'd be that'd be super cool I'm going to just going to forward this to accounting if there's anything else for you to say about that topic go  yeah uh YouTube announces changes this week clickbait slvo reply/ thirdparty AI training YouTube announced starting in India it will be removing egregious clickbait defined as videos where the title thumbnail don't match the content wow interesting some examples they use are in quotes the president of the USA steps down where obviously that didn't 
I have heard and I haven't experienced it personally but I have heard that misinformation is a particular problem like especially in India in like WhatsApp groups and apparently I don't know this I have not experienced this but apparently um it is it is it just spreads like absolute wildfire and it's caused some serious problems um that's all I really have to say about that that's that's all I've heard interesting uh YouTube also allows creators to opt in to third-party AI
training what are they training question mark who knows but at least creators have the option to opt in it's not on by default what this is just YouTube announcements this week so this is completely separate from the other thing so no yeah for sure that's just so weird uh YouTube is also testing a new voice reply feature in comments this can only be done by the creator of the video that's actually really cool it has to be a reply to someone else's comment and only on iOS
what for select channels why only on iOS I don't know man this is kind of based on something that I had asked them to do a while back I definitely didn't ask it for to be only on iOS but you got to understand iOS is probably if I had to guess I'd say it's like 90% of top YouTube creat It's not their own thing I know doesn't matter they at the end of the day look look I could make this argument the other way too should they serve their customers or should they serve their own platform do
both well sure but just release on Android and iOS yeah that's not the question I was asking yeah and when you're when you're triing a new feature that might not ever even go full release like do you do the 50% of the work that reaches 90% of your users or do you do the 100% of the work that reaches 100% of your users I I I understand it I I don't have to like it  it yeah discussion questioning click Team Green acting sus a user posted this week on X that they were experiencing up
to a 15% penalty in performance while having the Nvidia app installed on their computer several other users and Publications also tested this claim with a variety of games and while some may reach up to a 15% penalty it seems that across the board every game that was test stop between 2 and 12% on average I think there was some solution here I think you just had to like turn a particular setting off yes and Nvidia is working on fixing it so I we just wanted to make sure people know to go ahead and
uh do we know what the setting is though I don't remember go Google it yeah it's figure it out definitely googleable it's a very easy and quick fix it like it sucks but it's not difficult to solve citizen 5391 asks how much flexibility do you have with accounting you gave "away $500 and now $1,000 donation I mean" how do I how do I how do I put this it's all his dollars well it's not sort of it's all yours and Avon's dollars it's it's mine if I decide to give it to me which means it's yours but it isn't yet
right until such time but you have full control of it as I decide to give it to myself means it's yours but it isn't yet but you own it which means it's you do though because you own the company I own the company that is a separate and distinct legal entity but you own that that owns it and it owns that I do but that entity with its board of directors through inheritance you own the money you own the company that owns the money you're being very literal right now luk being very literal Luke I could stab you
I just haven't yet yeah yeah same thing that's I have a knife that's no it's not the same thing at all no it's not is the same thing no is it it is the same thing because the government has to get  it it's not the same thing Elijah enough um anyway the point is that at the end of the day if it's just down to money um as long as I'm not doing something that's going to get Ivonne mad at me uh or that is going to affect someone on the team's goals or like their like their kpis or their quarterly bonus or
whatever else if it's just out of the profits of the company then I I have basically to Luke's point full discretion to do whatever the I want with it no you could technically do all those things anyways that's self-control oh well no no no I just mean I just mean in terms of like what my rules are yeah that's what I mean though it's self-control cuz you own it so I I know that ivonne's not going to be upset about us donating that amount of money to a cause that we think is cool and I
don't think accounting is going to be bothered it's it's another check yeah like it's it's yeah so so whereas if I was doing something like in the middle of Wan show I took a brand new product that we launched and I marked it down 90% right the Creator Warehouse team now has to scramble to get a new order in they now have to figure out what the heck they're going to do about all the sales that were cannibalized by this new product that is now priced way under it they have goals around profitability for
the store and inventory management that I've now just completely screwed up self-sabotaging your own company that's a and and and and the people within it and the people within it if we're creating a bunch of work for people that's not okay but if we're contributing some cash that isn't mine because I haven't decided to give it to myself yet then towards a like a project that's kind of cool and is aligned with our corporate values and with M and yvon's personal values then that's not a 
CZ just wait till just wait till I'm not saying he's going to do this but this is pretty normal just wait till he sets up a charity then you just yep it's I it's more of a thing in the US yes it's not as applicable yeah it's it's it's less of a just like infinite money is it weird how when especially American but business people in general get really really rich they suddenly become philanth anthropist wow I wonder why it's a whole thing it's a whole rabbit hole and it's not all conspiracy
theory nonsense there is a lot mixed in with it which is kind of annoying and frustrating but um yeah it basically yeah like okay Mackenzie Scott seems to be actually doing it which one's that that's the one that used to be Bezos H yeah but it turns out he prefers like 400b lips so I've genuinely no idea what you're talking about it's fine don't worry about it I didn't follow that at all I was like wow this has no relevance at all to my life Jeff bezos's ex-wife seems to be like
actually giving away a ton of money in a way that's legitimately actually helpful nice um okay not not buying all the Farmland in the states yeah well we can move on oh they want me to fix my sleeve sorry about that all right wancho after dark merch massages let's do it sure oh we Al we also got to go purple there we go nice nice I didn't do it within 3 seconds no I just I I was trying to help yeah why do you got to ride people like that he's going to stab me now well I don't blame him I
might has it yet I'll do it for  Luke I I just got Oblivion on sale from Steam do you have any suggestions for greatest enjoyment should I wait for skyblivion before I start you might want to wait I don't know uh Sky oblivion's different right like there's there's new voice actors there's been changes to some of the items there's all this stuff going on um it's also not out yet it is it is theoretically releasing in the year that's going to start in a couple weeks but um we I we don't technically know
how good it's going to be and it will technically be a different experience now if you just got it and you're going to play all of Oblivion and then play all of Oblivion again when skyblivion comes out that sounds like too much that sounds like a lot of Oblivion yeah I  Oblivion approaching on two decades ago it's probably been enough time for me um but yeah I'm might wait if I were you but I don't know make your own decision go watch the sky bivan videos and then figure it out yeah
and whatever you do don't mod Sky Oblivion with not safe for work character models yeah yeah zero hot coffee there's  sure will there be a lux version of the commuter backpack doubt it people would uh yeah people would  so our relationship with our previous backpack supplier got a little strained we haven't been a perfect partner either there have been some projects that we started with them that they did work on you know sampling and and stuff like that that ultimately did 
but we did move forward with and and create as products um you know they're not understandably thrilled about that um there however were some things on our side that we were not thrilled about either like the fact that we bought "40,000 backpacks that were supposed to" have a double layered bottom and instead did not um we weren't thrilled about the design flaw with the Carabiner things like yeah could we have caught them earlier yeah sure that would have been nice but we like didn't design them or
validate them that was supposed to be you know the backpack making experts that we were partnered with um so so so that so so eluxe products were made in cooperation with our previous backpack supplier so have to like redo it is possible that we could do another Lux something um maybe with an apple leather maybe with apparently banana fibers are like super cool there's some really cool stuff from there uh this came up actually during our last merch meeting we were having a conversation about this
um the problem is that the volumes are really small and the opportunity cost of working on a Luxe product is very high there's a lot of other stuff that we could do instead of faffing about making you know a couple hundred backpacks so will we ever do it I'd like to I'd like to have a lux commuter backpack um and the people who bought the original Lux backpack very happy are extrem extremely um ver are extremely happy with it like look at this thing 19 reviews this is a $600 bag and like the
nice looking best functioning backpack I've ever owned um okay someone hasn't got it okay well we'll have to get that sorted out I mean customer service should be looking into any tickets or um any reviews that are like are particularly they got refund oh they got a refund oh well they got a refund exchange rates oh H I mean uh the accounting of that is very complicated and I'm not going to get into it here but I'm sorry that it worked out that way basically um my daily six days a
week beg five stars the point is the people who have it flipping love this thing five stars five stars easily the nicest backpack of a best looking bag I own people talk about just getting comments on it and people asking where it's from it really is it really is an attention grabber um but we just didn't sell that many of them and yeah I I don't know I don't know if it's going to happen I'd like to I'd like to it's a cool product but we got to we got to work on stuff that somewhat you know has a has an
opportunity to scale what what technology would you like to see become more widespread than it is now I don't know technology is like every pretty widespread um oh man I'm trying to think like I mean one of them I'm I'm currently investing in I I want to see Nas become more widespread yeah like I think the vision behind I think the vision behind some of the storage coins and stuff was actually pretty cool I jumped on that man um I really wanted that to be a thing for those of you who don't know the idea was
that you would contribute like you would mine the coin that like whatever the storage coin was I for what it was called but some kind of storage coin by providing space to like a a decentralized cloud essentially and um then people could pay they could buy coins in order to back up their data to This decentralized Cloud uh I you know I'd love to see a future like that where where Nas is just mainstream and like kind of everyone has one and you just kind of you don't have to Just Surrender
your data to Cloud providers um I hexos hopefully is going to be a step towards it being easier to easier for I wouldn't say necessarily normies normies yet but kind of techsavvy people like content creators and Gamers to bring their storage on Prem um yeah I'm going to go with that I'm going to go with nas hi Mr tips it recently came to my attention that most of the data USB cables I have are what is the status of your USB C laun I need like uh 10 GB per second cable is he going to do it I think he's 
it I had a quick chat with tinin uh before the show today so we were talking about spec versus Real World observed results and talking about where the lines going to be for um for our SE where we switch over says don't talk too much oh don't talk too much to be specific he says it's a bit more complicated than I thought oh okay well anyway I was chatting with tinan and this is a cable it's a nice cable it feels great um I really love that the speeds and feeds are printed on the plug mhm that
is so not really printed it's like stamped I guess on the on theed embossed sure um it's it's so cool because a ton of different USB cables they don't even tell you when you're buying it what the specs are at all uh and then if they do tell you when you're buying it's just on the box you take the cable out of the box and it's gone you'll never know again yep um it's just permanently on there we just have the Watts and the speed and Bost on to both ends awesome so you can never mistake what the
capabilities of the cable are this one which I'm not going to show you the full length of because I don't know if we'll be able to deliver this length at this speed this is a 20 gbit per second 240 watt cable as you can see she is thick like she like I've got this I've got this cable like she is she's thick boys so I've got this USBC um widthwise and lengthwise here so you could see it is like as thick as the entire housing is going in there like she's so thick we don't even need a
strain relief necessarily like we've got a little bit of one kind of built into the the molding for the housing but she's just she's just only got so much turn radius but it still does that fairly nicely well the reason for that is that we're using so in spite of the fact that they are they are coaxial conductors inside here rather than twisted pair because only the finest for our for our um loyal customers um where was I going with that again right we have coax in there something
something shoot I was talking about how it it it right nicely right so the way that we managed to make them Supple anyway and like like flopsy doodly is that we're using um a very similar like silicone style sleeving to what you would find on like hobbyist grade wiring um so they're they're just going to have like like that really nice kind of soft touch feel and they should be extremely resilient against uh UV uh as well as just you know the the the ravages of  um as for some of the very very detailed
questions um I am going to that totin yeah he's in full plane chat yeah I just unplugged my head and maybe maybe we can talk more publicly about stuff uh later when things are a little bit more locked in but not right now so anything yeah anything tinan is willing to kind of talk about in the float plane chat um I'm willing to let him talk about because realistically he's probably going to be a little more conservative in terms of you know what he'll say um and he also is the most knowledgeable
one on the team about this project all say for now is I'm really excited because they're nice I think there's I think there's room in the market for this product uh I think that from what I've seen there are premium cables but I don't think the pricing is reasonable there are a lot of cheap cables that I think are being marked up extremely high and the build quality of them is extremely low I think that there is room for an extremely premium cable it's not the last thing you'll
ever buy to a degree cables are consumable yeah they connectors are they're rated for insertions and and and and you know strain and like all that stuff nothing is going to last forever but I think there's room for a very premium manufactured cable very high quality materials good shielding um good design choices cable that is not ridiculously expensive due to an extremely high markup we're going to mark them up in such a way that this will be a sustainable business for us
but I think that much like our magnetic Cable Management right which seems like an obvious product for someone to clone right like why wouldn't you just clone it it's just a plastic arch with a magnet in it it's really hard to clone it because the cost is in the neodymium so unless you just make a worse product you're not going to be able to clone it and out compete us on price so in much the same way yeah you can build a cable that's like cheaper or you can whatever but these
are there's just a lot of copper in them there's just a lot of shielding in them yeah um so I think I think this is going to be something that's going to be really appealing to the folks who are willing to sort of buy once cry once with their cables and everyone else kind of need not apply yeah you might not need super fancy cables it is what it is Top Gear says order double your initial predicted quantity you will blow them out in the first week that's what I think but I have um I have not um had a lot of
success communicating my confidence to some of the other members of the team and this is where this is where like you know consensus is important and it's not as simple as me just  out and being like just buy it right because other people's kpis are tied to managing stock on the store it could be running a reasonable business it just is because of personal rules which is good yeah yeah like I did kind of pull it a little bit with this one yeah cuz they wanted to order fewer SKS instead
of having more granularity in the lengths and I was like what's the dollar value on this just order them like I don't want to talk about this anymore everyone's in a while I will pull that card just because time efficiency to me part of the value of this product is that we're going to have different lengths and I want it to be a really good companion product for our cable management products so I want when we're doing stuff like setup doctor I want us to have the right length bloody
cable right so there's there are business reasons for it aside from just like sorry how many dollars is this just put it on you just put it on the corporate card we'll deal with it later you know it's not it's not entirely that like I did have reasons for it but um yes yes canel Netflix for this we're going to have we're going to try to have lots of different lengths so that you can have a nice tightly managed setup that's their username cancel Netflix for this that's good love it I thought for a
second I was like did they cancel Netflix to save money for the cables like what what are they talking about anyways um couldn't you just do a pre-order thing pre-orders are tough because it means we're taking your money now you're not going to get it until Lord knows how long like what if we run into an issue like what if our supplier completely screws us over like we had with the ratchet on the screwdriver not the ratchet the yeah yeah what if we get the initial order in and it's like oh my God they
they produced the whole thing wrong or something like that like it's just it's so much my life is so much better if I just don't have your money honestly I don't need it yet I I only need it once I have something of value to exchange for it I don't I don't need it now I just need it later yeah yeah one oh never mind I'm so excited for this though they're very nice I just people are going to people are going to see the price and they're going to be like that's insane who would be insane
enough to buy a cable from LTT LTT is overpriced they're they're garbage their YouTuber tax blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and then the people who get it are going to order it and they're going to touch this thing and they're going to be like holy crap are you kidding me right now have you ever held a USB cable like this no because no one isane enough I'm so curious to know how much they're going to cost I have no idea today's today this is not right now but yeah today is the first day that I've seen
these people are going to hold these and they're just going to be like this is beyond compare it might seem stupid but the embossed thing on the plug uh is like worth money there's other brands that do it we're not the only ones we're one of the only ones but we aren't the only ones who do that I haven't personally seen it but there's there there's more to it than just that oh of course I just like that part A Lot CU I find it super frustrating digging through cables and being like I have no
idea what almost any of these really are it's just that the cable industry expects like ridiculous margins yeah um and so we're coming in it we're coming in and we're kind of going okay well like we have a model where our margin is sustainable and we think that there is uh there's room for us to take our margin model and bring it to a category where no one's really building a product that meets our quality expectations and yeah yeah see what happens see what happens cool see what
happens um Titan says we aren't looking into lightning even though I have an iPhone that uses it that is true lightning is the past and I think that probably um we would have other priorities like HDMI and display port Beyond USB that would come before lightning yeah yeah I know USB cables are cool but you get some like really  cables yeah yep don't worry we'll sell some of those even did they just say what they are on them oh I know right it's going to be good I'm excited
VGA cables win as someone who's going to start hosting Game servers and other I ask what uh would you like to see out of  I don't know stability and price sure that's a that's a fairly solved game I think all right archived sorry gone hello my parasocial friends lonus how is your bike painting project going yeah finish it up dude we want the beard what's going on I haven't touched it in ages I didn't touch it how could you be  what she wants the beard yeah she said in her forgot that okay yeah yeah yeah
yeah I thought you meant like I thought you were going like a like an I haven't like jacked it in ages so that's like disrespectful to her or something I was like what are you talking about no okay that makes sense in in the ion week thing we watched today yeah okay yeah yeah yeah um yeah I'm I'm in a lot of pain right now ah I have tennis elbow I still have residual sprain to ankle I pulled my back in that tournament um I need to go easy on my body for a little bit yeah and I'm kind
of thinking maybe instead of hitting the gym and badminton so much do some bike painting I might do some bike painting for a bit cool y nice hey dll are you guys excited for any of the booths that will be at CES I always enjoy watching the videos of the new monitor technology love the show I can't tell you anything I'm excited to see cuz excited probably embargoed multiple things that I can't tell you about but um yes oh I'm going for the first time in a while quite a while yeah
not super excited about that part let's go Las Vegas don't like Vegas viva viva Las Vegas yep I'm going too Dan's going I'm going for a vacation oh what I've never been before I'm super excited okay all right yeah yeah sure quote unquote asked I assume Luke was like don't bother do you like shows though like do you like theater and shows I want to go to CES I'm into I'm into technology I work here I want to see the super micros  material shut up both of you the show is
like so disappointing if you really want to see one of those shows you should have gone I did NAB which was super dry it's cool you know what I have never actually attended CES as just like an attendee so maybe that's part of the problem for me there is cool stuff there like if you're just going around and just like and because he gets to wear a lonus Media Group badge nope nope I'm not going for the company he has a different invite what cuz I'm not going on your behalf oh I just assumed you
would just badge up with lus Media Group so people will talk to you I don't want to get talked to oh I mean I just want to hang out it's also Vegas you guys don't like Vegas Lu you have any idea what percentage of the people watching this show are going to be at CES Dan like you are not going anywhere not Mas need to buy a mask mask oh crap I keep forgetting I work here I think I'm realizing I don't think I've ever traversed the CES show floor when not like either speed walking or tactically
maneuvering through a crowd like I haven't really when I see things it's because I'm glancing at them when I'm walking by but when I see things it's phone cases Dan that sounds cool oh why there's been a lot of development in that sector you're lying it's also Vegas I don't know you like Vegas it's okay it used to be better now it's what does that mean uh I don't know it's not as adult anymore oh oh yeah they tried to family friendly it up because uh like post postco uh they lost a lot of money right
it used to be more like bars and like gambling and now it's like things to do with your kids because please come to Vegas and spend money you know what I mean that seems weird cuz a lot of other places going in the opposite direction like people are talking about how Disneyland is like for adults now and stuff yeah apparently child- free spaces in like South Korea are like huge it's weird yeah I mean that makes sense looking at their population yeah stats okay cool uh why does my company
only allow us to use Wii with VPN and not ethernet for quote unquote security I have no idea that does not make any sense to me other than that maybe your network administrator is just like stupid I don't want to deal with the cable runs or something you'd have to well that they won't let them use the VPN when they're connected with a wire but they can use it when they're on Wi-Fi what like maybe just like whatever their infrastructure is they've taken some kind of shortcut that's built
into their like Wireless management thing instead of doing it at at like a router level or something like that's the only thing I can think of is if it's if it's only if they've only implemented something at the like Wi-Fi controller level or something I don't know I I understand you're just trying to figure it out but that would be so weird no I I get that's the only reason I could think of for sure yeah know I I why did all hotels rip the ethernet Jacks out of the rooms they were already
there yeah why did they take them out they it's just copper just leave it there so I can have a reliable connection I don't know I don't know I don't I don't understand it hey edl is there a type of video you would have made 10 years ago that you wish you could make today but it wouldn't perform well on YouTube oh yeah for sure I mean just like the the lowkey like hey check out this like random thing I'm working on like okay here's an example um coola borus like check this out
um oh man I can't even I can't even find this oh yeah here we go people are saying like yeah like our firewall doesn't let you connect a VPN from inside the interface and it's like okay but then it shouldn't let you do it on Wi-Fi either like I can understand that use case like I was just like oh yeah here's like two Tech coolers and I like hooked them up to like a weird thing why no this would totally work now no this would 100% work now you just need to do it with Alex and it would need to be
like yeah but this is just me holding it and like just like showing what I'm like yeah but this is the this is the like filming quality and the production quality not the concept this concept would do just fine now yeah I don't know it would do fine you could do it hyperd technology zip ties yeah we've never really changed have we 14 14 years ago yeah any Tech tips on cleaning the bearings in the Precision screwdriver mine has a 60 plus Second Spin and quickly went to 30 after adding a tad
bit of oil as recommended to a hybrid bearing it's now I don't know if it's better or worse it just cut off just stops there it's it's hilarious it's now character capping okay no I don't know that's a good question for T said it's a struggle or is a struggle to be exact yeah I mean bearings are that's there's a reason we don't guarantee a particular spin length and we do definitely know that there is some variance and yes lubrication can be helpful um tan said cleaning that
bearing is a struggle the amount of inertia for the endcap means that anything in there will slow it down yeah like we don't have our like we want to do like heavy like more fidget spinnery end caps at some point but we haven't done that yet and those ones are pretty light yeah even dust I guess I lldd lonus is the Rog Ally still your main portable gaming console current games on it checked out R Ally when um it's my main in the sense that it's still the one that sits on my
nightstand but I haven't really been using it much lately so what did I fire up the other day it was this weird game where you're like on a boat and you like manage stuff and you like fight stuff or something I don't know but I I got a bunch of stuff in the steam stale that I've been meaning to to pick up but I just haven't had time like I haven't even had time to paint my bike how can I justify playing video games hi W.D what is the most D oh hold on and just to clear something up um
yeah I think it is called Dred I was say a ton of people just said dredge yeah uh just to clear things up um it's not because necessarily the Ally is the best like if I was picking the thing that I like the most uh steam deck OLED is is sick or if I wanted more performance I like thex right now there's also might be some new stuff coming soon uh but it just the Ally like has my stuff on it and so I haven't bothered changing it okay mhm what is the most dangerous moment you've had showing off a piece of
tech like a hoverboard that shot out from under you or something going haywire oh I mean I probably don't even remember them at this point like there's definitely been some dangerous stuff I've never had something just like almost you know hit me in the head or something like that I had a Dremel saw blade get stuck in the face mask that I was using or strike it or something it broke and it did something with the face mask it was so long ago I don't remember the exact details I think
I probably could have killed myself working on this though oh my God self balancing unicycle V3 get a little balance in your life I used to try to put like a fun tagline after the title you know I felt a lot less stable than I look here and I don't look that stable on it and like you can tell I'm I'm moving nine years I don't remember this at all that's cuz you didn't work on it I did yeah but still I this was when I would do a lot of the um like basically this video was entirely me other than somebody like
setting up a camera like I wrote it uh this is oh my goodness that's baby my boy wow I know right that's kind of weird now yep so that was yvon filming that for me so I I basically did most of the like b-roll and stuff for this and then we just had uh we set up a quick uh shot in the kitchen I scripted the video um but yeah so I I learned how to use this and you know it's not the hardest thing in the world but there's a little bit of distracted operation going on when you're trying to film yourself
using something that you're not not necessarily a total expert at yeah I don't know I really liked the whole like e vehical thing but it just doesn't get start it just doesn't get views um can't really justify the time spent on it and I understand why like they're they're Niche they're inherently Niche there's all these like different types there's skateboards and scooters and bikes and unicycles and when I was in France a very surprising amount of people in Paris used the
a variety of different e vehicle things usually scooters and I don't just mean the like rental ones they had their own remember when you could just like fly drones wherever you want yeah that was pretty cool that was pretty cool remember when we sucked at operating drones any yeah that was pretty cool too is the backpack rain cover motorcycle wind speed approved motorcycle winds okay got it uh I'm going to say no to say  yeah it has a little I know but I'm just but we're not I'm just going to say no
yeah good way to go I saw somebody mounted a metal box with MCM on the back of their bike and like all the comments  that oh my God what oh I didn't I I thought that they had a metal box that they attached to MCM to no that's very dangerous if you attach it with the MCM yeah yeah not yeah it it like it looked cool and then you think about the ramifications of it like being on a road and bumps and wind and stuff and it was like oh boy magnetic Cable Management not Mighty Car Mods by the way ah yes
okay less and Luke how do you fair making friends at work while being in a position of quote unquote power it's gotten harder yeah like it's uh some people I find that it comes down to a lot of the same things as anyone else like the amount of time you spend working in proximity um the kind of enjoying successes together experiencing failures together you know a lot of the things that people just sort of bond over in general but I find that um for me like I can kind of be friendly with
anyone but I only I like anybody I only have room in my my social battery you know for a handful of of closer relationships for you know and um and that that room is you know somewhere between zero and and you know our total number of people on our team just like 100 plus and it's probably closer to zero than it is to a 100 so you know a lot of it is a lot of it is just that proximity and a lot of it is people's willingness to to like be a friend with me because I can't I can't
dictate that like I'm me I'm just I'm just kind of me and um I'm kind of a lot sometimes as you guys could can probably imagine that's he's a handful yeah that's regardless of being in a position of power or not a position of power and um and for some people um you know that's an impediment for for other people just my position in the company is uh is is a problem for some people just um you know me being a 1er you know right could be a problem well no I'm serious I know it's just
funny hearing you say well I try to be a realist right um and and some people like I I've experienced um I'm not going to name any names obviously but there's people who work here now that you know obviously treat me extremely differently that you know I don't think I would be able to be friends with just because of the amount of like kissing that takes place like I I I personally don't like that I don't like to be treated that way but for some people it just it's just something that they you know that they
do naturally or that they feel is important for you know advancement in work or like whatever perception they might have like everybody is so different and um you know so there's people that that you know I wouldn't be able to be close to because they don't treat me like a friend there's people that wouldn't be able to be close to me because they just couldn't see me as a friend and then there's people that just don't give a and uh you know we'll hang out and and bro out and kind of
talk about anything and and and just like be a normal human being with me and I I very much like hanging with those folks and uh and that's great and I don't have any I wouldn't say I have more difficulty with that today than I ever did but I will say that the percentage of people who are able to just treat me like a normal human these days is lower as a function of how many people work here what about you because it used to be you used to very much just be like an employee a rank and Filer and
now you like run like three departments and and I think can be a little bit intimidating and you're naturally more intimidating than me you're just like bigger and have a deeper voice and taller and stuff I get that I I literally get that as feedback is that I'm unapproachable usually people on my own teams don't give me that feedback yeah um but I I get that feedback externally sometimes not as much as I used to but still still sometimes um I don't know I've I've questioned I I
don't think I've talked to you or anyone else about this to be completely honest but I've questioned uh like is this a problem with me because I find that to be an issue but then you and I became friends when I was Employee to you boss and now it's like I don't know but then some of it's like the company's also just sort  um we're we're a real company now kind of yeah and that does create barriers yeah um to be honest because like when you when you work closely with every at
the company you kind of know where people's boundaries are and stuff whereas like if I act like myself in a group setting now I could easily say something that is offensive to somebody like maybe we have very different positions on say for example religion or politics or whatever else when you have six people you could say something like you know F some politician and know with a pretty high degree of confidence that kind of on the same page whereas when you have 100 people I guarantee you
there is no single issue that every single one of them could agree on there's also politicking and there's people that like might you don't necessarily know them well enough and it might make sense for them to hold a certain position publicly but they don't actually feel that way internally and if you really knew that person you might kind of know but now you might only know them on a certain level that you're unsure about and yada y yada and uh I don't know yeah willing spy says lies I bet they all like
Tech actually not NE no actually I like definitely no I hate it with a burning passion well not even just that's not what we're talking about I know I know what you mean there there are people that work here that like genuinely have no interest at all yeah they got hired to do the job that they do they like the job that they do they do that job well or maybe they don't even like the job that they do but they're good at it but they do it well good to be honest that's it's technically all it's needed um I
mean we're like any other company like think about your company think about where you work is everyone passionate about refrigerators or like whatever whatever the crap it is that your company not necessarily yeah you know and we like to have passionate people that's something that we care about and that's something that we try to Foster  right more yeah sure moving on uh would I see much of a performance hit on a GPU for example the RTX 50 Series PCI Gen 5 on a PCI Gen 4 motherboard at 4K resolution
probably not but we won't know for sure until we have a PCI Gen 5 graphics card to put in a slot and I assume that your question is based on both the slot and the card being by 16 that can change once we're we're looking at cards that are by eight or even by four because if you put those in an older gen you can run into some performance um differences yeah this is all something we've we've already talked about diving into um yeah cool and last one I've got for you today hello DL L I run unraid so I can
upgrade one drive at a time just heard about raid Z vev expansion can you talk about this does this give true nass the same upgrade ability all I can say about that for now is that there's a lot of exciting things probably maybe that have been thought of for ZFS um some of which are kind of being actively worked on some of which are not being actively worked on many of which are good cool ideas and um I'm very  holds that's all I got okay and I'm very excited to um talk about the future W
show you might watch because you sure as heck won't be watching any more of this one see you next time same bad time same bad Channel  bye oh so just got rated 6.9 out of 10 nice ah I'm so excited for our cables I have very little support
