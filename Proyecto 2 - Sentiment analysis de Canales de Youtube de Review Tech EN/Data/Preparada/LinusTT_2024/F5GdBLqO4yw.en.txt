you know they say First Impressions last a lifetime you better hope that's not true my God I'm so stressed just looking at this what is this cable hammock what did you do I'm getting fired my anxiety level is like up here there's more yes and this is my dad's setup wait this is the bedroom setup it's clear at this point that your condition is genetic thankfully the setup doctor has the Cure just take one of these LT magnetic cable management arches three times daily for a week and check back in with me oh
that's it well there is also the suppository bad cable management it's disease and someone's got to cure it that's why lonus became the setup doctor my name is Sammy uh and I'm the social media coordinator at Li group I am 27 years old I just work you got some nice decorations you know how many computers do I see well one two this skeleton of one I see another one outside the room yeah I won at the Christmas party you know the Christmas party was uh 4 months ago right I'm a busy man this monitor is
just on its stock stand and it has a two-headed monitor arm right behind it uh and this one okay what else are we dealing with today when I submitted my application for uh the KO management video I was pretty confident I was going to win just because my setup is pretty horrendous this is where my my parents usually watch watch their you know their K dramas and their shows you like the big bezels on this TV I do I like big bezels and I canot and on the back I think it's not as bad but I don't think so
brother it's functional here's an unusual technique it's called put all the cables in the front and don't plug any of them in all right first things first we're going to have to get that oh wow that's really heavy you know what I've got a couple of other patients to attend to uh next up is going to be Dan thankfully I've got my cable management Med students to step in and get us started uh lift with your legs huh I don't want you to need a real doctor good luck everybody first things first
we're going to take everything on your desk and put it into buckets let's go you like Halo I love Halo which one's  respect oh my God Sammy what oh he didn't put the io shield in yeah and he didn't give it to me Andy so this desk needs to go upstairs to his dad's room so we need to go clean  desk my dad's step is actually cleaner than mine now this is what happens when you tidy nah don't worry we'll get you there wow everything is still chaos it looks like I didn't miss all the fun
then our treatment plan is based around the LTT magnetic Cable Management arches and the secret lab mag Magnus pro desk the cable management tray on the back spans the entire length of the desk making hiding your cable mess a breeze and thanks of the power pass through up the leg we don't have to worry we'll always have the right length of cables whether we're sitting or standing and while the desk pad is oh so soft the whole desk is also magnetic and secret lab has a host of magnetic accessories
to keep everything in its right place radio head reference and it works brilliantly with our cable management products too learn more in the link in the description why don't we get the hardware stuff in place sure and then we can figure out how many cables we need to support the stuff that he's actually got plugged in wait out of all the computers you have this is the one you want to put in there you don't even have your GPU in the right slot brother oh yeah so this one's broken well and it
goes that's not my problem we're cable managing the room not the computer before we put your system in the holder that goes under the Magnus can you tell me what makes you think this top slot doesn't work uh I had a pcie extender and I kept taking in and out and I think this ran out of like the amount of times I can take out before it expires okay because all the pins seem to be fine and their Springs are oh my God who built this computer do you see how scuffed this is what did you do I took it in and out
also why do you only have two screws in your motherboard one of which isn't even in all the way you only need two and you only have two no you do not only need two screws for a cooler oh yeah no so uh this was when this wasn't working I thought it was a AO issue cuz I kept screwing it and it broke yeah you kept screwing it I can't tell at this point if Lon is actually acting up for the camera or he's actually just annoyed by my setup at this point oh no this is horrible you had bare pins just sitting
in here like this is 5vt power and ground if this touches the case it shorts out it could fry your motherboard no this is actually bad but it works you literally were just talking about how it doesn't work yeah yeah never watched the PC guide in my life I just kind of put the shapes in there and then it kind of worked realistically though Sammy fixing this cluster Jam is not my problem today can I have that side panel please here's a tech tip for you if you can't get the panel on time to eat some more
Doritos get that weight on there thankfully the secret lab desk can support up to 250 lbs right there there we go easy peasy look at that awesome the front panel won't fit on because he put this he put this fans on the wrong side of the thing he should have moved his radiator back and had the fans inside this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy also two screws half of them loose for each of them oh my God is this hard drive in the front of this case even mounted to anything no no it is not oh God uh don't look in here
lonus is that a sealed copy of Diablo I yeah he also has a 6970 that's just out on top of a GeForce 8 8800 GT with uh he also has an IDE drive that seems to be a key stowed in this mountain of junk that fit Sammy are you kidding me it didn't fit do three of them not fit maybe is it probably it's probably for like two 140s they fit dude I'm tearing this thing apart they didn't fit no might not they don't fit I promise they don't fit I promise you don't fit okay well I'm
moving your hard drive cage back and I'm getting no I'm doing it give me that no I promise you it doesn't I promise you lus need some time alone so we're going to go cable manage in the living room just looking at what we have here I think we might be able to get away with the desk solution which includes two large arches three medium arches five small arches two power bar keys two power brick holders as well as the accompanying plates and a bunch of cable ties I'm thinking that's going to be
enough but also don't worry we can just  store.com so I don't know if this can be an issue but there's not a lot of magnetic stuff around my media console as you see that's totally fine because our magnetic cable stuff comes with metal plates that you can stick onto any surface and the magnetic stuff works like that our power brick holders are pretty neat because you're able to use our LTT store cable ties and just kind of loop them in like that which actually means that you can use a lot of different
sizes of things so this might not be a power brick but what I can do is I can take this tiny media box strap it on and we can hide it under here where it's going to be out of sight but you're still going to be able to access it if you need it and then if you ever need to like plug something in you can just pull it down I've done that with your psvr already it's just under here now that's a pretty nifty way of using it Adam yeah I was pretty proud when they came up with that good job so we have a bit of a
dilemma we have this nice car-shaped PlayStation stand and at the front are USB ports with USB sticking out so I thought maybe if we turn it around and have the back stick out but then we have all the cables from the PlayStation so I need a break you have to choose the  editor you can turn this into a lightsaber right I should be keeping a list of everything that was wrong with Sammy's computer your motherboard screws were 632 your standoffs were N3 I have no idea how you manag to drive some of them in
there I already fixed the 24 pin but you know how it has those four that are detachable well they detached oh they were only sucking like this far I knew my computer was up to expectation I didn't know it it would get that bad you know you have this headset that has to be coming out the front because you're going to be playing your VR over here convenient way to deal with that is if we can kind of have a a nice place to hook this up and hang it so I'm going to put this Cable Mount just underneath
here so that the cable can be hung and easily put away instead of just strewing about on the ground I have a theory that there's nothing wrong with this computer other than that it was not assembled correctly I'm just going to test that real quick here by putting his GPU back in the top slot well I was trying to turn this on it wasn't working uh I had forgotten to put the 24 pin back in after I fixed the four pin so that that's why it wasn't working but I went and I inspected the
front panel connectors and they're all wrong like the power switch works because it's bridging power and ground but instead of going this way it's going this way function of her form is my saying there is nothing wrong with your top slot look we still have some mystery cables to figure out I see that we have lots of mystery cables uh one is spare speaker wire neat I think it's for the front channel oh it's for the front channel oh un managed the laptop has been there since Google Chromecast sorry it's been
there since before the time of Google chomecast yeah 2013 yeah I remember cuz lap that laptop was the first gaming laptop I had and I paid League Legends on it nice now that I had sami's computer working perfectly with the GPU in the correct slot I need to put his Wi-Fi card back in so we can get the latest drivers and all that so I asked him hey where the heck is your PCI bracket he goes no no it came like that we're having a little BET right now you are no it didn't if it doesn't what do I
get then you get a crappy incomplete Wi-Fi card actually do you know what muing is M meow no meow meow meow meow I have cats it's like it's like you go like this and then go like this and they show you off your your uh your CH chisel jawline what if they doesn't come with it you should do it with me I don't  necessary so exhibit a this picture oh is that what bracket is oh that's what you meant this bracket this actually isn't the right one though this is a uh low profile one I have an idea I found the
PCI slot covers that came with Samy's case and I found the half height bracket for this card so what I'm going to do is a little trick take your mind off that pain then what we're going to do is we're going to cut holes in this and we're going to stick this through here and then we're going to like attach these together somehow and make a bracket pull oh that is so cool it's  cool I have an update on the wireless card Saga I can't believe I didn't think of this in the first place we poked
holes and we were thinking oh how do we secure this to the we don't need to check this out we're going to screw in the antennas and that's not going anywhere functional in all seriousness though this is a very important problem because if you ever accidentally bumped this antenna thing and it jostled that card removing it from the slot it could kill the card kill the motherboard or both I cannot believe how solid this is now to get the fresh working computer clipped into the
desk there we go wow that really gets it  huh okay in all seriousness it does touch the floor I'm at the very very bottom but this is a standing desk so I'm sure it'll go up a bit at some point I got to say a nice metal desk like this is a match made in heaven for magnetically mounting accessories like these antennas or our power bar holders now I just got to run these up here is what I would say if realistically I wasn't just going to put this in the thing in there anyway but
there are some things that we're going to want to put on the bottom things like you know excess slack for charging cable for wireless headphones or a controller or something like that I have little coils hanging down from the other side of my desk with just a little Cable Management arches it's pretty nice this is your primary monitor yes low sensitivity or high sensitivity uh High sensitivity High sens so you don't need a ton of mouse pad space where's your desk pad are you going to have a desk
pad on top of this yes I will this is not an lmg uh mouse pad that's fine it's right games I don't know oh sure right gam store.com I was about to put some of our cable management arches on this cable to kind of lock it into that desirable spot and Adam's like no you have to use secret labs's Cable Management thing with my Bobs there fine you happy yeah looks great so we need to get it at kind of the height that you'd be at is that a short joke no I'm short too so if it was
then I'm allowed we're average height King in Korea what is that supposed to mean means we're average height Kings in Korea what we're in Canada though if you saying that Korean people are typically shorter are we oh we are yeah the nice part about this video is we won't have any comments of people not getting jokes cuz we've had to explain the M Samy get us at the height you want to be here right there okay and then what height do you want the monitor at uh probably like right like this this is
nice actually cuz sometimes when I want to play like more like FPS games yeah I want to bring the mon closer so then it's like this actually problem I actually had way before so I can like game like this you know oh interesting that is the epitome of first world problems but it's a very first world problem but a problem nonetheless we have easy access to all of our plugs by having our power bar right up here the cables are nicely managed without too much tension so you can still pull the
TV out everything's nicely pressed up against the back of the TV and we even have our streamer box and our PlayStation VR tucked away out of sight and how are we making out up here Reese pretty good we're about 80% of the way there wow making great time might be out of here before dinner if you eat dinner at 700 p.m why do I always end up on people's floors okay I'm turning on your computer okay you ready moment of truth let's go have we actually plugged in the power to
the desk one of the coolest things about the Magnus Pro is that it has its own built-in power distribution so you just plug it in down here at the bottom right and then you got plugs up here for your power bars and all that stuff that just sits on the holder in the bottom uh so the one monitor turned oh well this one doesn't have the power brick okay do you want to run and grab this power brick yes sir all right they're not making this yeser thing a meme sorry sir stop it I'm taking this off
no my revenge Denis probably just like had a heart attack right now and he's not even dead and he's turning over in his grave do you know what else is appealing a chance for you to receive a visit from the setup doctor himself that's that's right he's doing house calls baby for now we're only going to select winners from North America but if the series gets enough traction we will be traveling a world wide to fix viewer setups make sure to smash that like button share the video tell all of your
friends and if you want to enter all you got to do is like this video subscribe to lus techtips and submit your info and pictures of your setup in the link in the description to win do it I know you want to can we put the camera on the other side is there a reason it's on that side is there a reason it's so far over is that do you want like a really profile look we're going to put this brick from ug green right here and then we're going to manage these cables right here so
there's just enough slack that you can bring them around top as needed but that they can hide a away down here but lonus how are we going to do that without a cable management that sticks it upwards we didn't even script this he's just trying to make it sound scripted I'm just in the event you have any cables running up or down the sides of your legs you can use these convenient cable sheaths from secret lab that nicely match the aesthetic we just can't really figure out why we would need them
because the desk has built-in power that goes up the inside of the leg so there's nothing there and then it has that built-in cable tray that holds everything secret lab you did a too good of a job by the way little hack if you have a power brick that is too small for the big power brick holder and too big to hold really well with the little cable tie holder you can use two of the little cable tie holders I'm happy with this this one happens to be magnetic anyway so it kind of to the top of the
desk so your watch charger is always going to be there and then I put two arches so you can grab this one and grab whatever cables you need and then you can just kind of like tuck them back there and that way they're up nice and flat here so we don't have to look at them I consider that acceptable it's a headphone hook yeah oh yeah and it's magnetic oh yeah oh this is from secret lab oh that's cool I swear to God Sammy you run one cable in this whole setup and you managed to do that to it Adam oh
my God so here have a seat and let's see let no no no on the chair oh I just want to make sure I'm always lowered I didn't say KN oh my God not like that is that where you want that that doesn't seem comfortable aren't those Wireless yeah but then I don't like charging it oh oh right now that we can so then you can just grab one of your USB C's and put it in there oh this is awesome there's one last piece of the desk that we haven't put on yet and it's the little Cable Management tray cover piece
man it's even cleaner dude no no no no no this is this is ridiculous your digital hygiene is just as bad as your physical hygiene I smell good no no not personal hygiene like like your stuff how do you have this many things that load when your computer Lo like look at all this stuff half of it's even minimized already it's a it's a functional mess opportunity cost it's not opportunity cost every single time you turn your computer on you're wasting your own time wisdom Adam with the wi
when I when I boot it I can go get drink of water you know well that's an opportunity cost why are you drinking water that's the problem with your generation you asked before why your generation can't afford food or housing that's it right there you drink water now to check out what ad him and wow wait dang give credit to Reese he he nailed it this is awesome yeah what a transformation yeah I'm glad you were able to get a desk and then hand down this one to your father this is way
better than being on like three different tables yeah now it's only on two different tables I think my dad would like this he's the reason why I'm in Tech same way my dad's reason I got into technology too my dad's the reason I got into Tech too cuz he didn't know and I had to fix everything my dad taught me lots of other stuff so what do you think wow it looks good awesome dude this looks awesome yeah this actually looks really nice in spite of you what because of your help I
help well it means because of your help but in like you didn't really help very much kind of way I can actually breathe in this room now look at this setup we went from absolute zero to complete hero and in one day with only four people working on it we managed to do this room the bedroom upstairs which looks absolutely incredible like I would want that set up in my bedroom and we've even got the living room looking awesome I did not stick around for Sammy to put back his countless plastic things uh but
we'll get some b-roll of he's going to do it and he's going to do a great job and it's going to look beautiful it's going to look as beautiful as this and the whole room is going to be beautiful yes sir if you don't we take the desk back and it's going to be the same deal for you if you guys win an upgrade I think Adam told you guys how to enter right but there's information down below we can record that let's do it oh yeah and massive Shout Out secret lab this the desk is incredible the accessories
are incredible I mean the results speak for themselves is this awesome or what yeah well your desk won't make you a better gamer it just make you look good doing it I look handsome right can you say I look handsome I can say I look handsome yes dads am I right guys ah yes another patient cured thanks to the setup doctor make sure to tune in next time when the doctor treats his W show producer Dan besser you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the time I spent my day
off doing basically this but at my own house
