minutes the problem is everyone knows where my office is if only there was somewhere I could hide wait the stairs it's perfect with origin PC's sponsorship I can finally take this unused space under the stairs and turn it into my own little private gaming Hideaway all I need is one of their sick pre-built PCS nice monitor some mood lighting and I'm never going to want to leave all we need to do is tear down  wall oh I think I found one of the studs that's good we're going to need 
wow that looks totally normal which is the point if I didn't know that there was supposed to be an Al Cove here I would have no idea whatsoever man they nailed matching the Finish oh I see it they painted the whole wall no they didn't what well this is great I  clever you could probably figure it out but most people aren't and my boss isn't don't tell him I said that if I didn't know that you know this trim piece is probably supposed to be painted and this corner didn't used to have a chamfer on
it I would think this was the exact same kitchenette that was here before but it's not not dude we probably moved this out like a solid foot didn't we yeah at least let's see if it worked who hello wow spacious we got more like an extra two feet in here but it's not exactly cozy or gamy yet so I'm going to need some amenities if I'm going to hide out and game for a few hours first up is storage I'll need some shelves to take advantage of all the new found vertical space dude
I could probably even stand in here I'll be able to Stow things like controller snacks maybe some game consoles we also want to put a nice chest of drawers where do we want the chest of drawers so we're think to put the chest of drawers actually in the back and it'll be like a triangular chest of drawers so it'll be slidy ones that kind of pull out right brilliant cuz otherwise the space is just feels wasted like there's it's so low down there speaking of space we don't want to waste any with our display
So the plan is to try to mount it as flush to the drywall as possible so we're going to need to cut that out and then mount it directly to the studs behind it where's our computer from origin PC going who sponsored this video it's either going to go here where we put in a power outlet yeah or they kind of made this uh column go all the way to the ceiling uhhuh there's plumbing and electrical back there but we think it's only yay high so we might be able to cut that out and then put a piece of board
on here and it's perfectly PC sized okay if we can fit it we also need to find a spot for our mini fridge which should just barely fit in through the door we should have put that in here before we I know we measured it though it it should fit it should fit cool now the floor is concrete and not super comfortable so we're going to need some padding as well as some kind of chair to relax in now as you can imagine it would probably get a little stuffy in here so for ventilation
we've got an air intake in the bottom of the stairs also pretty stealthy from the outside and lastly we've got this Nifty switchable film from Smart tint so that I can uh take a peek into the lobby to make sure the coast is clear and when I don't want anyone to see what I'm up to it goes basically opaque this is kind of a lot are you sure we can pack all this in there oh yeah absolutely okay we've got some progress here we've got a bunch of stuff installed everyone's been busy
we've got drawers in the back pretty sick we've got our fan set up here for exhaust we realized that if we did an exhaust up there and an intake here it's just going to come in and go out hopefully this will have enough air pulling through the room once we're done so it stays a little cool we've got our window so you can turn it on or off to see through it lonus wants a privacy windows we can know if anyone's coming or not we've got our mini fridge and then we've got a space cutout for our
computer from origin it's going to be sick we've got a surprise waiting for you for the end here and then finally we're going to mount our 42 in OLED uh display we also threw some nice softer floor in here kind of like a gym mat we had a bunch left over from LTX and uh we put it to pretty good use I think doesn't hurt your knees to walk in and out of here anymore all right guys check it out we've got a ton finished we have a bunch of our RGB signs that throw off so much more light than I was ever
expecting it's actually pretty well lit in here we also got our 42in OLED screen set up in here it's not put into the wall we decided that half an inch from the drywall wasn't really worth the extra space savings but we did use some French cleat to get this thing as tight to the wall as possible and it's looking pretty sharp nice and flush also we managed to fit our PC from origin PC thanks guys for sponsoring this video uh this thing is sick but the best part I'll get into specs but we also
made a little door for it we'll fit this a little snugger once we're you know done with cable management and everything got a core Ultra 9 285k on a motherboard from MSI our z890 P Wi-Fi 96 "gigs of ddr5 RAM running at 6,400 megat" transfers per second it's got a 4090 in it with 4 terb of SSD storage and it's all being powered by a Corsair RM 1200X shift 80 plus gold power supply and we machined out this aluminum thanks Sebastian from Creator warehouse for helping with that we've got the big
origin logo on it pretty sick and tons of ventilation so even though a 490 is probably going to be kicking off a lot of heat we should be all right as for what's left we're just going to kind of wrap this pipe so it looks a little nicer we've got to obviously do a bunch of cable management around the room um we're going to make the tunnel a bit better we've got some upholstered material that we're going to put on the back of our dishwasher door as well as on the floor so that it doesn't kill
your knees to walk across and then you know aside from a few more finishing touches fill the drawers with snacks maybe add some consoles and a bit more decoration I think we're pretty much ready for lonus to come check it out all right so what we are doing is we're taking this very nice cushion that Reese and I made it's absolutely perfect no flaws and we are going to attach it to the door um we couldn't think of an entirely great way to do this because normally when you're doing a puler what
you want to do is you want to have your main board at the bottom piece of foam and then whatever you're going to be upholstering it in however in order for this to work we would have to screw the board to the dishwasher first however we then can't upholster it I'm sure there's a way way to do this but we're running out of time so it's getting valker to  instead that was a bit rough it was a little rough nice next we're going to make the inside of our tunnel a little nicer by adding some nice black dutin
we're just going to cut it to length and then staple it around the inside all right it's been a lot of work and a big team effort but I think we're finally ready to show lonus let's check it out this looks great dude I've seen less profession installations of dishwashers from actual contractors yeah oh you know what's funny I can feel a draft around it from the cooling in the room you got that positive air pressure okay so I assume  just oh no way we got little plushy
cushions so when you crawl in your knees don't get hurt uhhuh you guys thought about me that's right we upholstered some extra firm foam oh I love this sign keep out gamer at work I love that this is actually the only way in and out of this space like other hidden rooms you can tell that they like have a wall that moves away so that they could film it  out this is freaking  when we set out to build this the intention was that I would be able to hang out in here we could get like two
or three people in here this is freaking awesome well are you coming in or not yeah I was waiting dude this is crazy and where did you dig up the old prototype dog bed CPU thing I've had that for like 3 years it's perfect I know I was struggling to find a good seat and then I was looking at it and I was like this is it this is it this is it dude we've got a 42in OLED with our origin PC oh have you did you see what Sebastian no way let me show you around the room first there's a few things there's a few
things aside from our sick backpack hook for the day pack which is available now on LTT store.com we took the best features of our original LTT backpack and we put them in a smaller sleeker more stylish package it's the backpack that's built to support your day every day and you can grab this fantastic 20 L bag for $149.99 at LTT store.com however for a limited time we are offering a never-before seen launch discount while supplies last you can save 20% on the commuter backpack just click through the

uh and then we kind of thought that oh it'll just like take it right take it right out so we just put in an intake cuz exhaust wasn't doing anything and but it's fine no it's great yeah it's like pretty good yeah no it's Breezy yeah yeah yeah uh we've got our mini fridge flip the door to the other side so it's easy open oh we got storage boys they're surprisingly deep way look at how deep that goes no way I thought we were going to do this like oh yeah to make a video we can't remove this no we
can't remove anything right no way maybe okay so there is some Cloud FL around the sprinkler system we'll take the fluff out fire fire department we know we don't worry it's all good we got this we got you yeah uh all the RGB signs are at like Max Capacity in terms of power from these power bangs if you we have to turn them on in sequence and with brightness lowered on some of them or they just don't light up uh but we got them all working there were a few more we couldn't power on any extras this is
so cool threw some posters up put in our sick uh origin PC oh dude dude from origin that looks amazing right Sebastian again cut out the metal uh Justin helped me with basically everything else how's the ventilation does that is that a 4090 it's a 4090 how's the ventilation on that it seems okay I mean look at how much space there is and then this is all just open right oh oh I thought this was a window okay no no no no no this is all open it should be fine it should be might get a
little T I mean it should be fine let's find out let's fire it out are we waiting for top shelf here fact that we can stand in here oh yeah like back when we were originally looking at the space I did not think that standing was going to be possible Right but like I'm fine yeah yeah and we're able to make use of all the vertical space in here like this is very very Sittin a bow stop PL from the future here we did a deeper dive on this crawl space showing you how we made it things we
wish we could have gotten done and more we're also uploading a bunch of Ivon content head over to lmg g/f Flat plane to see it now we got a bunch of plushies and comfortable stuff it's very cozy got a rug that fits almost perfectly in the room oh yeah I didn't even notice fits pretty great just gym mats underneath for a nice cushiony feel how do I have my shoes on I'm being yeah you got this is a shoes free zone I got socks got socks on get the shoes out of here get out your shoes I threw a sleeping bag in
the bottom drawer on the right right  case it is a matter of time for someone until I actually come hide down here you know Wireless peripherals we've got our headphones we got a headphone hook for them you guys absolutely outdid yourselves thanks I was a little worried there you know if we had more time there's a few things we'd like to do a bit better don't even out did really happy with how the pipe Cloud turned out Justin put all that up dude it looks amazing it looks really good that was
the ugliest part of the room easily this was my brainchild and I was like look I I don't know any of the specifics but I always wanted to do something with like those windows that you apply voltage to them and they go opaque or they go clear yep so this is our peephole so we can see if anyone's like looking for us or whatever so how does it how does it work there's a switch up there I think it's the black one uh-huh this guy right here yeah and essentially oh no way and it's
powered on when you send voltage through the film it turns clear and then when you switch it off it's opaque dude and from the other side I saw it already it's like it just looks like a little thing on the wall so it wouldn't draw anybody's attention it was Alex Dick's idea I think to put extra pictures of other LTT store products up because it kind of looks  7950 and then we had to we had to put the do flap up because the RGB was shining like pink and purple and blue and stuff that's hilarious but it works
great I me oh my god it works awesome like you could oh jeez it's Elijah the fans were just using a vent under the stairs and you can actually buy like these powered vents that help your own uh home heating system but we had you know we had to use 120 mil fans so we just threw four of them up wired them to some power and away they go and we got a nice breeze in here this is actually usable oh yeah like this is clearly not just like yeah we threw it together for the shot and that's it actual thought
went into this I freaking love it it took a lot of work it was a huge team effort props to everyone else on the team um yeah a little garbage would be nice for the few rappers or whatever you might have there's space there's that's the thing that we were most astounded by once we were all done we were like there's a lot of room well we got a nice flat mount for the TV what did we use for that we went with the French cleat m just like a proor screen yeah we wanted to sink it into the wall but we realized
we'd only get like a half inch right there and it's yeah this is why we have so much space it's tot that that was a stroke of Genius cutting out this pillar and then making a spot for the computer there I love that because if we had to have the computer like obviously when you've got a 4090 origin can only make it so small right to have enough cooling it would have taken up a bunch of our floor space but instead it took up zero of our effective space this looks awesome this is what a
42inch display yeah looks great right even at 1440p just OLED looks so good what more could you ask for I could ask for you to not bother me and tell me we have to leave here and go film other stuff this guy he's like yeah you can do one more game and then we have to go film the rest of the video okay I thought the whole point of this was that I can hide it was a mistake having the writing team make the room because now that means they know about it yeah at this point I'm going to hide I'll be the one
hiding honestly everyone I've talked to who's like come in here they're like I could totally bring my laptop in here and just start working for a little while yeah just Vibe uh oh we should close we should close the door oh we should close the door oh we haven't even shown how we close the door there's a pole there's a pull cord so you can actually close it behind you and it's completely stealthy did you notice that oh it's from all the way over here ethernet C oh tape to tape let's go get out of
here go on go go on get go on go on get no way how'd that not go in I don't know dude this space is incredible massive shout out to origin PC for making this video happen uh if you guys pick up An Origin PC one of the biggest benefits is of course their lifetime technical support on their systems you guys can check them out at the the link in the video description get out of here oh the preeptive boom let's go theose that was close he's off the post let got this oh wow let's go Rory mchy with the goal if
you guys enjoyed this video wow we've never done anything like this so why don't I just throw you instead to another video that origin sponsored when we took one of their systems dumped a can of Coke down it while it was running and managed to still get all the parts working it was pretty wild
