guys today uh what is this the doj will try to force Google to sell Chrome no not like like you have to pay for Chrome in order to use it like sell the Chrome business unit this is freaking wild uh we could also talk about the fight last week or should we call it a show yeah I don't know we're not boxing commentators but like realistically that wasn't a boxing match so Ah that's a good call hey got him okay we're probably not going to talk about that so hold on hold on let me
find let me find something else here um I I should probably expand on what we said last week or rather expand on why I wasn't able to say more last week about the Hiatus saai is that the term for multiple hiatuses Hiatus whichever one it is Ivonne watched the segment and she was just like that sucked dude you you didn't even like explain why you can't explain and I was like well I thought it was self-evident and she was like it wasn't and I was like okay thank you better half I will do better next time I
do I understand why you thought that but I also understand why some people might not get it cool let's go uh what else we got today uh we need a puffery shirt the number of people that talk about puffery ever since that segment is ridiculous it's really stayed around um y'all don't seem to want actual Tech tips yeah Yeah question mark no that that seems to be a thing that seems to be a thing we can talk about that we can talk about that also Microsoft ignite 2024 uh things you don't want plus 
the show is brought to you by notion vessie server part deals that's a new one and our laptop partner LG our rap partner dbrand and of course our chair partner secret lab who sent over new chairs for us they're just like the old chairs but whiter and like soft yeah they have they have soft armrests which we're both wearing long sleeves cuz it's like the heat just turned on this morning so it's not actually warm in here I was good I they told me to wear this oh which is extremely comfy oh okay
but yeah well whatever I'm cold so I actually do need the hoodie why don't we jump right into our headline topic today um the Department of Justice will try to force Google to sell Chrome ban default search deals and license data for 10 years also Chrome OS might become Android uh so they have uh they've submitted their recommended remedies to judge Amit meta who ruled that Google illegally maintains Monopoly on search back in August and these are the recommended remedies so selling their Chrome web
browser the doj views it as a key component of Google's search Monopoly with approximately 65% browser share across all platforms with chromium based browsers accounting for nearly 80% of the market however I would I would push back a little bit a little bit on clumping other chromium based browsers in with the chrom not really their fault well it is and it isn't the dominance of chrome is what's making a chromium basis so important for maintaining compatibility with the rest of the web
and even though Google does not single-handedly develop another chromium based browser they can certainly shove um certain they they can certainly shove certain um ideas uh along and and and make them difficult to go against even though it is possible in some cases they can they can attempt to manifest their own optimal business environment oh I like that yeah I like that that's good that's good um so anyway I I think that the number is a little I'm just saying I think the number's a little fuzzy yeah
it's clearly not 5% but I also don't think it's 80% 8% no matter which one of them it is though let's be real that is a dominant position and it was it is one that Google has has painstakingly meticulously created and used to their advantage um this is kind of wild the next recommendation is Banning Google from entering into default search deals which amount to 26 billion annually and might end up hurting Mozilla more than it does Google brutally yeah to be clear a lot of that 26 billion is going to
Apple not to Mozilla but um man this one oh I have kind of I have kind of mixed feelings on on the one hand yeah these default search deals are a huge part of why we all tolerate Google search because it's just there when we open up our browser with that said if that works then more people would use Bing but well or yeah yeah know I mean I understand Ed is still default in Windows and bang is definitely still default in Edge If the product was that bad I guess people would be willing to switch off of it or
maybe that's different platform by platform I mean um this the whole uh switching to iOS experience has definitely has definitely opened my eyes to how intu doesn't mean intuitive it just means whatever Arcane Ridiculousness you've personally gotten used to right um and and that is true that's true across across multiple platforms I mean how is it intuitive to press control alt delete to access some kind of system menu it's not you've been doing for a long time exactly so it's
intuitive to you specifically exactly so so depending on the platform you might find users more or less um and it's it's pretty well established that behavior across IOS and Android users is different for example I remember like years ago this used to get talked about a lot more um and maybe it's because there was more transparency into the numbers I actually don't know why nobody talks about it anymore but I remember it would it would make headlines sort of like cyclically that
Apple users spend way more money on the App Store yeah that used to be super common to be talked about I think that was often when there was notable or more notable I would say differences between the apps I remember people used to be really frustrated because Android users had lower image quality on Instagram back in the day yeah yeah that was little things like that um were were much more discernable it was you you generally had a worse experience on Android because Android users were seen
as like cheap and not worth focusing on development yeah and and and and and and they were yeah to be honest so like yeah like like very measurably if you don't remember this it was like a huge topic and like like a many times multiplier it wasn't like the average Android User spends 9% Less on apps compared to the average Apple user and this was more of a thing back I would imagine more of a thing back when uh like pretty much every app was like kind of useless unless you spent like $2 or3 like that
was what a that was what a paay app was back in the day it wasn't so much subscription Based Services in 2024 the average iPhone user spends $22.77 per app by comparison the average Android User spends $619 per app so it's still double still double wow okay as far as my understanding goes it was like a much bigger Gap in the past but I'm I'm not I don't know 100% right now I don't know if what parkol is saying here is true but if it funny if true H Snapchat on Android was apparently just
a screenshot of the camera compared to iOS directly using the camera it doesn't re it wouldn't really it wouldn't really surprise me that much it works uh I mean yeah and do you really need uh do you really need that kind of Fidelity in a pick I mean I'm just asking questions I'm just asking questions you know if you if you have lower Fidelity you might gain a pixel here or there yeah I mean isn't that the whole point of Snapchat low Fidelity get it different kinds of fidelity seems good I got it I'm
actually I'm that was that was pretty good surprisingly funny this early in the morning that that was really good I'm actually I'm actually giving myself one of these that was not bad um what's her what's what's her nuts Ashley Madison just released their um just released released their um most uh non monogamous cities in Canada list oh no yeah uh Vancouver is very low really Vancouver is very low non- monogamy so uh I mean to be clear I'm not saying that that's that's a goal I'm I'm just
there's there's all kinds of well there's like you know ethical non- monogamy yeah but isn't that site specifically based J I'm not judging you if you're s is like for cheating though well there's a big difference I mean is any site for anything really Luke I mean is float plane for Early Access to although although very occasionally very occasionally there are things but I was actually hinting at something were you what I yeah look what I found oh wow well I didn't find it Emma put it in my
luggage and then I found it that way but I found a relic wow that is uh not even that many people in the audience are even going to know what that is now that's a name I've not heard in a long time a long time I I pulled that out my luggage I was like what what is this yeah so apparently I lost the shirt but I still have the toque so cool I uh I'm pretty sure I still have the shirt kicking around but it's my shirtm it was for a time now it's mybo shirt another another name that hasn't
stood the test of time um what on Earth were we supposed to be talking about oh right um Google sure they also are recommending that Google be required to license its search index data to competitors for 10 years so this is the kind of like W not slap on the wrist but actual like no you guys need to not behave like this again and you guys need to take active steps to prop up your competitors to make up for the anti-competitive practices that you guys have engaged in and I got to tell
you already like like we're not even all the way through the list here already I'm looking at this going I um I have no idea what's going to happen in January because on the one hand um I think we've I think we've both been pretty happy to see the US actually finally engage in oh dude Lena KH any antitrust um investigations and Remediation um but I I have no idea whether that will or won't continue with the next administration because I think that everyone on both sides of the political Spectrum can
agree that um it is likely to be unpredictable yeah I I know a pretty strong theory around this whole like you're going to have to sell Chrome thing is that Google's probable defense is going to be to delay as much as possible and try again with the new Administration the thing with the new Administration though is I don't think they have any particular love for Google the in general General reply to that theory is that uh big Tech right now is kind of at odds with both sides um which
is kind of a funny thing because um a lot of the a lot of the transgressions that both sides are kind of mad at Big Tech about are are very different from each other like they're sort of mad for completely different reasons and it's hard to feel bad for you know the tech billionaires that have kind of you know sold us up the river over and over and over again over the last couple of decades but I do kind of feel like at this point um now that everything's so far gone that um they just are
monopolies whether they you know kind of like it or not and to be clear you do not have to be the mono in Monopoly is not actually like strictly speaking necessary right um You you can just be in a dominant abusively dominant position you don't actually just have to be a monopoly to follow foul of antitrust regulations if you completely control everything yeah or don't or even or or or collude with a handful of other parties to control things yeah verium has an amazing video on that so there
are some very very um there there are some very non monopolis um cities in Canada sorry wait what are  about uh the point is just that everyone's kind of mad at them and looking for an excuse to kind of punish them but the mediation that another Administration might ask for might be really different yes I guess is is what I would worry about so maybe roll the dice again kind of thinking this is probably one of the worst they could have got and then hoping for better I don't know yeah I do think the just
jumping back to it a little bit because I saw some comments about this in the flow plane chat when we were talking about it but the 26 billion in search deals hurting you know it's going to hurt Apple but not really um Apple will be fine yeah exactly it's really like the the big damage that we're probably  um they're they're declining in usership effectively constantly um oh thanks Dan I wasn't actually okay I want to clarify something really quick that's not my gesture for fill my water I was checking
if there was water in it that the Optics of that were not  that's I didn't even notice that's pretty funny um but but yeah so like honestly this shakeup okay significantly less cash in the bank I suspect it might immediately hurt Milla in the ability to employ people Department things like that as far as my understanding goes they actually had layoffs recently I suspect that may continue if this happens but a significant Shake up in the browser Market could result in a userbase increase an actual one um we
can hope that could result in Firefox actually having long legs instead of this just constant decline to eventual um irrelevance which they've been kind of on the path of I I I I enjoy Firefox I use Firefox daily in my personal life um Firefox has been my mobile browser actually the entire time I've ever had an Android phone since the very beginning of having an Android phone um it's going to be so much less lucrative for Firefox to even have users if they aren't benefiting from that Google
default search deal yeah um you know Bing could swoop in it's not a ban of there being default search deals it's just a ban of there being you know Google Google on um it reduces the competition yeah who's the competition why would Microsoft have to pay a ton of money for it and and if I'm Microsoft and I'm watching this go down for Google I'm like I don't know if I want to do that yeah yeah I AG I mean that's like that's how this is supposed to work right like that's these remedies are not supposed
to be oh here's A1 billion fines like cost of doing business they're they're supposed to be like oh crap everyone else looking at this going holy crap we we really should not do that we should not do that people are talking about like Duck Duck Go the ISS is that Duck Duck Go doesn't have any money like they have money but they don't have like billions of dollars a year to use our search engine money otherwise they would just be doing it already uh outar I outar I'm guessing in
flo plane chat said uh since 2019 Mozilla has lost 30 million monthly average users yikes yeah so they've been on a just they've lost like almost an entire Canada of users eventually they're not going to have anything to take this money from anyways right like there will be nothing for Google to have bought from them um so like I don't know I I'm I'm hoping that a reroll of the dice a shakeup something like that uh might give them a chance um it's going to hurt a lot in the short
term because that money is just going to disappear but I don't know hopefully something can happen out of this that that works out I think the real question Luke is what have you been doing to help  Mozilla it's not like there aren't things you could do uh using it personally it's not enough we we put on Ian why don't you make it why we put on the lab site that it works best in Firefox why don't you make it so that flow plane can only be accessed with Firefox since they're all using Firefox
anyway it wouldn't be a problem that is a good call we probably should have done that yeah um I can I can look towards doing that in the future do you have  me I think it's this iPhone I think the iPhone is a lot worse in terms of interference because I've kept my phone over there for since before you brought the iPhone wasn't causing an issue unless it got damaged and now it's for those missing context we've done some polls and the float plane uh the float plane audience swears up and down that
they are using Firefox but we have actual like site access statistics and they don't yeah people have pointed out that you can like spoof it so that it reports that you're using Chrome for like weird compatibility recent things I sincerely doubt that that percentage of people are spoofing it sincerely definitely not a thing um all right uh yeah more remediations not selling Android but restricting it from favoring Google Search now because this is focused on search and not you know web
mail or web documents or whatever the case may be it sounds like they could still have default Google apps but I do Wonder if this uh if this all goes through if this all went through if Google would look at a lot of their current practices and go hey how do we avoid any more of this um restricting Android from favoring Google search that is like what would that look like so instead of that default Google search bar like I would be prompted when I I suspect on phone setup you or maybe with
an update now one time and then phone set up in the future um you would be prompted to choose your default search and there would probably be like you know your to be random to five and then other um and it would probably yeah the list would probably have to be randomized wow um and it would involve undoing Google's $2 billion investment in AI startup anthropic that would be a big bummer for anthropic wait really why no no no no like what I'm saying not that it would be a I understand why it
would be a big bummer for them uh I'm I'm wondering why they have to do this uh I I don't know a ton about anthropic and that and that investment uh but what I would guess is that anthropic is uh super super focused on search um but I I'm just guessing I'm completely guessing uh Google has responded calling the doj's proposal staggering wildly over Brad and part of a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and break a range of Google  um in an example of how excruciatingly
horrible this would be Google said that the proposal and this is a quote would literally require us to install not one but two separate Choice screens before you could access Google search on a pixel phone you bought and the design of these Choice screens would have to be approved by the technical committee and that's just a small part of it we wish we were making this up is that an actual quote that's from Google's vog are they for real right now um this is oh my goodness guys
yeah like a device Setup Wizard is a thing which you already have by the way this is actually very interesting because this is such an early W show we have a bunch of EU viewers and apparently this is like already a thing for them that makes sense uh dorex said in the EU you already get to choose the search engine on Android uh technically they said as far as I know at the end of that um this is hilarious yeah people are saying yes we have that already yeah so like what do you even mean you
already did it for them and it's worth noting that in the EU um Android actually maintains better market share than it does in the US so clearly clearly that ain't the variable that is affecting that so annoying what an annoying thing to say I hope they lose just cuz of that can you can you imagine sitting at Google and thinking that typing that is a good idea like how did that at a certain point you wonder if like the person who wrote it is like yeah let's let's torpedo ourselves a
little bit cuz like that's the worst I don't know we wish we were making this up are you kidding me hold on you know what no my my source thing oh my God like is that is that poking fun at yourself this is literally literally at blog. I didn't even believe it like I I trust I trust Riley okay and and he had the citation in there so I saw the citation I went I don't need to click through to this but I was like no no the people deserve for me to actually click through to the Google Blog yeah
and see that this is literally we wish we were making this up I wish I was making this up we already did this in the EU so really we don't have to do any of this at all but we wish we were making this up I I've had multiple conversations with multiple people good people strong people the best people tear streaming down their eyes the the wlist of people um about the like the slow death of just Google in general like they suck like if we're if we're looking at the landscape of like modern
you know web Silicon Valley sty companies what have they done in the last long time other than just like kill stuff and not innovate let me think what have they done okay does it count as a thing they've done if they ultimately killed it no okay that doesn't count no okay hold on thinking uh Google Fiber oh wait no hold on um and that's old at this point wait no this dead dead uh okay hold on there's got to be something apparently uh the EU has had the choice screen on Android since 2019 uh actually okay
YouTube YouTube has done some pretty cool stuff YouTube is the only thing I've been able to think of that has had positive Innovation and it has also had really junky negative Innovation yes this is true this is true um I would say yeah I was going to say that finding stuff to buy through Google search if we're talking about monopolies is better like like the interface is better but all the sponsored stuff that up the results is not better so I I take that one back um Android is better than
ever yeah but like nothing crazy has changed in like it's better than ever though it's like sure well I'm looking you ask me to find stuff so when I find stuff you don't get to be like yeah I fair enough fair enough okay Google workspace has stood still for a super long time they don't even have their own realistic chat I know they have chats which they swear to me that they use internally and I don't believe it uh oh oh uh Google Maps Google Maps maybe they do but they also use other
things I bet maybe other people have had access to this for a long time but my Android auto interface for Google Maps finally allows me to report problems um like if I see police I can report it in Google maps I mean they acquired ways what 10 years ago um so it's it's it's understandable it took them a little while to Port that functionality over um someone says they've had that in maps for a long time I don't know man it it did it did not show up into my interface until like a couple weeks ago which was
the reason that I exclusively use ways even though W is search is terrible like my own Badminton Center doesn't show up in ways search and I don't I don't I don't know why because it's on Google Maps so like you they're literally owned by the same company I thought that's the point of being a monopoly like the actual point but anyway on basically everything they've Stood Still on on they have some people the company that are obviously still doing good work like they have uh their
their AI researchers wrote the white paper on like what is breaking the world right now um but then they have like one of the worst ones in Gemini because they didn't capitalize on it because they don't seem to be able to do anything and the reason why I got onto this topic is is because of the we wish we were making this up almost feels like they're they're pointing at themselves because the and the design of those Choice screens would have to be approved by the technical committee that part is
like okay yeah because we can't trust you to do it on your own based on your own website and documentation you already did it so like what are you talking about yeah that looks fine yeah it does it looks completely fine and they literally already did it yeah that looks fun let's just do that what are you talking about make things again like Google was such a sick company I really liked Google I really like Google workspace I can't tell what's different in Google workspace from tell I can tell you cool
stuff they've done they have those like Hardware decoding cards for video Hardware video decoding cards those are cool when did they make those I don't like a while ago but they like are like working on them and stuff yeah so they they um that's not really for you though we get the result of it yeah we look I I I have said before and I maintain that YouTube is one of the wonders of the world it is like I I think if we when we if we didn't have YouTube anymore we would look back on the time that we
would have that we had YouTube and we would go the internet would be different good Lord like the the the knowledge the sharing of Human Experience I I I really do feel would be a maybe not quite on that level because of how little sort of written knowledge there was in the world at that time right um but I I I think that given even more time and given even more more buildup of of collective knowledge and experience I I think you could make the argument I just didn't want to make such a strong
statement uh but no I think I think it would be I think it would be like that losing something of that magnitude at this time one of the big things with YouTube is when you'll you'll find videos on there that are like from 13 years ago and it's it's like potato you know but it's it's when people were archiving footage from like pre- internet era yeah so it's not only is it from 13 years ago it's actually from way before that yep and there's literally nowhere else to access it because on YouTube any
Yahoo it's kind of a joke cuz that's pretty good yeah uh can upload anything they want and it just is there and is just documented um that is that is I I I'm not going to call it a public service because they're clearly a for-profit company and they and they profit from it um with your data and your attention to ads and uh your premium subscriptions and and all of those things but it to to lose it would be catastrophic I think at this point yeah but yeah they i i i when's the last
time they launched a a Gmail you know you know like when they launched Gmail they launched it on April fools almost as like a joke and then just took over the world like they they don't do stuff like that anymore Google workspace again hasn't moved at all Gemini I'd say yeah someone's phone is oh sorry that's me Gemini is I'd say docs is notably behind do noticably better than it used to be all as someone who uses it every day it's a lot better than it was five years ago I'll tell you that it's definitely
better what's changed um in The Last 5 Years specifically I don't know but just it's the interface is just always like getting a little better it's always getting a little better there's still things that's probably one of those things where I can't imagine it but if I saw a version from 5 years ago it's probably changed subtly over time there still things that are super obnoxious like once a document is is pressing return is two spaces it's like damn near impossible to get it to stop doing that
for some reason like you can go in you can tell it single spacing you can tell it whatever you want uh but if you like paste something in that has that inherent formatting in it already for some reason it just like breaks it forever as far as I can tell I'm sure there is a way around it but it is not intuitive to a word user um a longtime word user someone in fping chat Tim said come on you know more than anyone that small backend changes are so huge and you don't realize them unless you look
at them side by side yeah I know that what what I but this is from a consumer standpoint Point give me give me something as a consumer backend changes smooth out your infrastructure and make managing it easier and they might even improve responsiveness here and there but for the most part every time that I've seen Google tell me that a backend change is supposed to make my user experience better it has made it literally worse I'm sure it happens a bunch of times without them really
communicating to you this is totally a thing it's it's super annoying being being on a team when you have to work on stuff that users most egregious example of this is the analytics dashboard which used to be extremely Snappy except for the occasional time that it wasn't and now okay of course it's behaving well right now yeah now it is for the most part a piece of garbage it's actually doing really well right now but it it it had it I I I I could talk for a long time about how much I
hate the new analytics dashboard and it's not even new it's like 7 years old at this point but I I can't stand it I can't think of anything new that I use from from Google and most of the old things that I use from Google are becoming harder and harder to justify over time due to price increases from you know getting my YouTube music for my premium subscription that just went up by 60% because they're trying to shoehorn in AI features that are really expensive so they're cranking the price
up just give me Google Play music back yeah I it was actually better like the the thing that I the one feature I cared about the reason that I spent a bunch of money on Sonos speakers and the reason that I got a Google Play music subscription was because from my music app I could just click cast like like just the cast button you know like like the chomecast cast button I could just click the cast button and then pick my speakers and the integration was perfect and Flawless and
I never had to touch that piece of sh Sonos app I like and now that it's like so bad that like their CEO had to apologize um I I feel so validated in that sort of that decision I made to completely avoid it also oh my God I don't know when this happened but again back to Android auto for a second here I can't search in my in my YouTube music app like I have to like I can voice search not in the app like I can be like I don't know play Justin Bieber or whatever right like I can do that but if
I'm if I'm like a if I'm like using the interface there's no search and the browse is super hamstrung and what's what's really wild is there's no start radio button in it anymore and that is literally like how I use my music app is like I find a song that I'm kind of in the mood for and then I click Start radio cuz I just want to I kind of want to listen to stuff like that for a bit song yeah um and that that start radio button is no longer there in the player for me and I I see a lot of people when
I was talking about Maps saying like oh yeah mine has this mine has that it's all over the place though the fact that you I'm not saying you don't have it and you you guys might even have a start radio button I have no idea but I don't and it is very annoying very annoying um okay no one is actually yeah no one's actually disagreeing with this so I guess yeah it's uh it's apparently still still bad but yeah just just get bury the hatchet with Sonos and just make it work again
please please yeah I don't know I just um I've heard a lot of stuff about how and who knows what's true and what isn't true but I've heard a lot of stuff about how things work inside Google apparently the best way to get promoted was for a long time was to like Champion a project to launch yeah but then you would just get promoted after it launched so it that project would like lose its leader stagnate and then get closed down so it was just this like farm for Junk for a
long time so for at the beginning they were making new good things rapidly and then they saw new good things coming out rapidly as a good thing for the business so let's incentivize that and promote people that do that um but then the people inside that just wanted promotions and money uh were abandoning all their projects so they were making new good things and getting rid of them rapidly for many many years and then now they just don't seem to really do anything cubes the gamer has one
RCS yeah and that wasn't just a matter of like developing it that was that was like La launching and maintaining for an extended period of time an extremely ultimately effective campaign to get attention from regulators and I was saying a big part was the lobbying almost more than anything else um I think RCS is a good example it's crazy to me that there is this few "examples for a company of 200,000 people" this is true this is fair uh Google meet  days I'm just saying look it barely
matters when people are actively moving away from Google workspace because if you want to be on workspace and you want an actually good chat client you're using workspace and slack and workspace and slack as a combination is quite expensive in my opinion slack is significantly better than teams um workspace itself though has stagnated so hard that Office 365 seems to have mostly caught up to them yeah if not at parody the biggest problem with Office 365 is that teams is just such a
dumpster fire um it's better than it used to be but it's still so baded messages to group chats that have not existed before yeah I know why well if you attach something to a chat message you have to wait for it to upload before you click Send yeah why in slack if I attach something and click send it just sends once it attaches yeah duh like there's there's so many things that are just holy crap if you're in a big group chat it highlights the box for whoever is talking except for you so you can't tell
if your mic's working why why just why there's so much stuff that's just so confusing we need to get a couch on the L show set so he can so he can lie on cou teams but teams therapy teams is going to keep improving because something that Microsoft is quite good at is this just NeverEnding March yep they just keep moving usually a little bit slower than everybody else sometimes backwards but they just keep moving So eventually teams will be good enough you know there's only so much you can do with a
chat client you're seeing the type of innovation that slack has been bringing lately and it's like eh I think we're at feature parody with MS and messenger now so the uh the only way to go is upward from here we're getting there but it's it's just it's going to be really hard for it teams to justify the cost of having an expensive Google workspace subscription especially when they're trying to not give you discounts anymore unless you also buy Gemini which nobody wants and then also a very premium very
expensive slack subscription when you could get all of that under a 365 license or a lar license or something like that at a massively decreased price with more features vdka makes a very important Point here um until we have a nudge feature parody with MSN Messenger uh will not have been achieved you are you are right yeah thank you for that and I'm sorry I have misspoken I have besched the good name of MSN Messenger uh and I will not do it again Miss mess I will not do it again um okay what else
we got here uh Google claims the doj should be focusing on revising search distribution agreements instead um okay this is interesting Google isn't the only one who thinks this is a bad idea some analysts worry about its feasibility and unintended consequences for example it could potentially harm schools that use Chromebooks and disrupt the browser Market which relies heavily on Google's open source chromium project those are both good things some analyst realize that something might happen if this
happens um and like this is one of those things where it feels a little bit like the housing bubble in Vancouver where the not in my backyard the bigger the bubble gets the more hand ringing there is over doing anything about this because of the economic harm and it's like the longer you hand ring the harder the economic harm gets but like if we' done everything properly we wouldn't be here in the first place and the the the further we allow it to to expand the bigger the explosion when it
pops like yes there's going to be collateral damage if all of this goes through there will absolutely be unintended consequences but the longer we wait the worse it gets the more the more atrophied every other potential competitor will become because of Google's dominant position this is why you shouldn't allow this to happen in the first place ideally yeah yeah speaking of the Vancouver housing bubble it's it's kind of starting to look a little shaky it's it's looking a little uh sh a little sad
yeah you know it's it's making a noise like sales are erupting though yeah sales are sales are going up which will maybe prop things up a little bit but also interest rates um apparently apparently the the Trudeau government is doing like uh like a buy your vote program right now yeah oh yeah you saw that too I'm happy you the exact same reaction I did oh the election's coming soon what if we uh what if we lower taxes and gave you money huh how about that huh what if we got rid of first pass the post you
ever think of that Mr JT yeah that thing you said you'd do yeah did you ever think of that because I'll tell you what I'll make you a deal Mr Trudeau right now if you're watching this I will wholeheartedly emphatically endorse you for the next election if you get first past the post gotten rid of if you do that thing you said you're going to do before the election you follow through on that first term election promise I will I will I will say hey for all of his other warts at least the ones that I can see
and the ones I can't see uh don't show me your warts hey he's got that cool fall down the stairs trick and he got rid of first P the post that's enough for me all right because we need election reform yes we do we need it desperately um so I'm there you go I'm in that's all you got to do what is first pass the post I would actually recommend that you watch a cgp gray video on that uh but effectively with first pass the post um you are going to end up being forced into what is effectively a two-party
system yes um if you don't have first pass the post you then have ranked Choice ideally so you rank your choices and if one of your parties that you voted for as your first choice is clearly definitely going to lose they just dump that and your vote goes towards the second choice and so on and so forth until there's a winner um it also it it also makes it so that uh like let's say you had a super polarized electorate hypothetical scenario um if if if you had uh if if you had your your
rank Choice rank Choice voting card and it had um like the the the super right-wing party here you had a super right-wing party kind of a Centrist party and a super leftwing party if you were to say uh well okay I am very aligned with the right-wing party and very misaligned with the leftwing party but I guess these Center guys would kind of be okay and if everybody basically did that but like flip-flopped that Center party would actually have some representation in the formed government yeah because if
everyone kind of agreed that these guys are okay even though one of the other two hyperpolarized parties was their first choice um those those Centrist sort of mindsets would be much more represented is pretty much what it would come down to first pass the post drives people to extremes because it ends up making in my opinion most people vote on an anything but them type basis instead of for what they actually want um and ranked Choice voting allows you to vote for what you actually want which
is like a enormously massive difference yeah or or or more like it allows you to it allows you to specify what would be un completely unacceptable and what would be more acceptable and what would be preferred and then you can you can account for that it often results in something that's a little bit more average not necessarily the best or better but it'll it'll help lean towards something that's a little bit more average instead of more extreme I don't think there's any like voting system that involves
everyone and is perfect I don't think there's any voting system that's perfect really no but first passive post is like definitely one of the worst yes there are worst ones yeah but but it's one of the worst but first pass the post is really good for the incumbent um it's really good for those parties that are that currently hold all the power so that's why it's really hard to get any kind of Reform passed because they are highly disincentivized to do it it's really it's really frustrating uh why is
it called first pass the post as shortcut it's called first pass the post because whoever uh passes the requisite number of votes to to win that race just takes all the marbles um instead of accounting for for anything else uh digital B1 says ver has a good video on voting systems and uh that makes perfect sense I'm sure Derek does so why don't you guys go check that out yeah uh moving on did we finish the Google topic um discussion question blog post multi Source within Google has told Android
authority that Google's multi-year plan to migrate from OS fully over to Android which lines up with the Google blog post from June 2024 swapping parts of chrom yeah know I think we're I think we're pretty much done I think we've talked about this enough okay so what do you want want us to do Dan announcements oh you want us to do announcements oh good lord there's a handful of announcements today uh uh uh okay from Tuesday November 26th to Monday December 2nd we will be running some incredible deals on
some of our most popular products at LTT store but what we're really excited for are these bundles that we're putting together with the help of some of our partners if you've already seen our Black Friday Cyber Monday um email sign up page then there something new on it uh make sure you sign up so you don't miss out on the deals also float plane subscribers oh this is is this because of uh like the new like better integration between float plane and LTT store uh or like what is this quite
similar to what we had before so just a different way of using it oh okay float plane subscribers will be getting one day of Early Access on Monday November 25th let's go now my understanding is that early access is to the week long  but it is possible that there are messages on my phone that will further  on uh what nope I do not have any further messages on my phone so I think that would be the weeklong deals I don't think that that will necessarily include some of the very limited quantity Flash
Deals but I do not know for sure the way to know for sure is to be signed up for the newsletter so that is at lm. g/ bfcm Dan do you want to throw that in all the chats to make sure that everybody gets that can do now it's time for us to play a game we're sorry we're playing a game uh some people are saying that they don't see the email sign up form it's probably because you have  nice that makes sense modern internet is a thing okay Luke let's see if you can guess what these
items are sorry I don't have an item here Dan do you know anything about this is it these what are these no I don't I've been wondering about what's with everything on the desk Dan there oh Dan's there what these items are what what items um but I think you had a good feeling about the item in the middle of last I don't know what the items are is it is it in this I think you had a good feeling what they were the bag I guess so uh Riley had mentioned this I'm so sorry Riley uh okay cool why
don't we come back to this L guessing game plan for the products on set which will be uh I don't know uh here anyway so the Early Access thing um uh subscribe at lg. gfp Black Friday uh to subscribe to float plane um people are saying it's the bundles at the bottom of the Black Friday page oh the question mark things oh I'm supposed to guess what they are thank you audience okay there we go the the big freaking bundles how specific am I supposed to get I think you're supposed to get very specific how the
heck really  Pikachu guess that can you just say ditto for every um I don't know the the first one based on the what looks like the wrist rest attachment and the fact that it it doesn't have uh the no you're supposed to guess the middle one the middle one oh it's a stream deck okay it's apparently in the human organ transplant bag that is on the set oh oops that's my thing why Luke I don't know what's going on right now any more than you do sure yeah cool oh it's not it's a wave XLR
it's from the same brand oh wow you got it wrong I'm sure they used the same housing wow Luke you're zero for one wait I don't think I'm going to get any of these then checken wait what no hold on a second what what's going on what I don't think that's right because the dock says the doc says Elgato stream deck Mark I is supposed to be in the    anymore um also from the shadow you literally can't tell the difference between the two I have one on my desk that looks like what is the silhouette
on the right uh it's a keyboard onon um I don't know I'm my my guest on the right Luke that's the left uh headphone on um these look like sennheisers they look like Jamaican headphones no I was saying Pokemon sure who's that Pokemon yeah sure yeah anyways um do any Pokemon have M at the end of the name Squirtle Monon anyways uh they look like smokemon SM I don't know too early um that's a that's a good reference um the Cucumber thing about how it's good for you or whatever yeah yeah I don't know why I
remember that jam they look like they look like I can't take credit for that I can't take credit for that that goes to sinful hands and FL plane chat um they they look like uh Sennheiser Headphones I'm guessing based on the band that they're like uh 600s check under your table right now it was wrong last time I I don't know dude I don't know they're sisers they're not 600s they're HD 560s both open back headphones uh nice both of these items are going to be included in bundles that are on sale throughout
the entire event or until we run out which is probably more likely but there's a third item on the left good gravy this is taking forever Corsair K65 Corsair K65 did you look at the dock no okay uh open it looks like it has a 10 it doesn't open the LT backpack that is  wow nope it's the K7 k70 core tkl with Corsair I thought it said milks and I was like really uh mlx red smooth linear switches a $120 keyboard that will be included in a bundle at no extra cost along with one more thing but this
bundle is going to be dropping on a random day throughout the week so I'd really recommend you sign up for email notifications at lmg g/ bfcm to have the best chance at securing one so I was I was five switches off yeah yeah good right brand though you can kind of tell from the silhouette that it's a Corsair keyboard yeah okay so we made our way through that eventually um also what are those what are those for the announcement left hand for the announcement right hand uh okay so
lineus cam oh but hold on I'm going to figure this out uh our collaborative wrist rest with Delta Hub is back in stock and this time the leftand variants are available too they sold out quickly during the first run and this time you can get early access to their Black Friday sale you can get 15% off by going through our Link in the video description and finally oh this is an announcement but has nothing to do with the store ovhcloud Summit 2024 why is it that Luke has a go bag
with him right now not because the world has ended yet uh but coming up on November 28th Luke will be live in excuse me live a uh hosting this year's ovh Cloud Summit live event yes there will be great discussions around cloud computing AI machine learning and more and it'll be hosted on their twitch and X links which we will have in the video description where you guys can find out more that is actually super cool I said 15% 15 um should genuinely actually should be pretty fun I've seen the lineup of of
people that I'll be interviewing I I'm actually genuinely so are you like a media personality again or like what what what do you even I guess who who are you I don't know what exactly is it that you do not sure to be honest okay cool just stuff whatever comes up prominent guy they should just ask for that to be your little like tag that would be pretty funny cuz no like Honestly though I don't know like I do this thing yeah you're like a you're a renaissance man podcaster development
team lead um lab thing yeah bird enthusiast I don't know there's all there's all kinds of like uh infrastructure enjoyer historically great lover of chicken chicken specifically chicken he loves chicken yes he just really loves it chicken's very effective that's what he loves about it it's the most effective bird mhm yep uh 100% hit rate on chicken why the chicken cross the road to get away  Luke you have no idea how many chickens have sacrificed themselves for my mediocre
physique um that's a stolen joke but anyways um yeah but I I I think it's actually going to be really fun I'm excited for that so okay tune in cool what what else are we even what are we supposed to be talking about today Dan can you please get this show back on the rails I've been trying are you still are you done with the announcements I don't know am I I'll read the dock for you then let's see yeah let looks about right then let's do some merch messages okay sure merch messages so you head on
the store you uh add something to your card a box pops up you leave a merch message we think it's better than super chats or twitch bits because hey uh if we get to your message great or Dan can pop it up down here or reply to it or forward it to someone internally to get you an answer well you know we're we're going to do our best to acknowledge imerse message but if we don't then hey well there's always uh you know getting some high quality merchandise in the mail yeah all right cool so anyway uh
merch messages hit me show us how it works Dan sure uh let's see up here first is from Zachary how much is Google to blame for people getting scammed Facebook and Instagram don't have customer support but if you Google it a bunch of scam results appear  mandatory so I think this is more of an issue with uh like Facebook not having customers be an incredible amount of free products that would instantly cease to exist oh man be clear yeah so okay so basically what you're saying is that
Google is returning search results that are invalid and that are scams when people are trying to contact Facebook and Instagram support okay so so step number one is yes a customer help option of some sort should absolutely be mandatory for any business and especially for someone that operates on the order that Facebook does like if we can afford to have customer support Facebook can afford to have customer support So any free service has to have customer support well dude nothing's
free it's not free so there's that Facebook you're absolutely paying for you pay in your data and if it wasn't profitable they wouldn't be doing it if that became a law genuinely a lot of services would instantly shut down if they had to have customer support yeah well hold on a second because I'm not saying every service like if there's some some like backend project or something that we have implementation for on our website or something like that I I think if you are consumer facing maybe maybe I should
call it consumer support then if you are enduser facing give me an example of someone who shouldn't have to have end user support for their product straw pole straw pole is straw pole even a company uh I don't know and like realistically I pulled that up of a top of my head okay hold on a second you uh do they have support watch them have support hold on a second what the what the devil is you contact theming type form and why do they have straw pool straw straw straw P easiest pull Creator
ever that only okay well apparently there's competition in the create a quick create a quick pole space Also hold on a second they have support they totally have support I just confirmed it on mine contact us support email they they have a they have a pricing structure now though so I did I wasn't aware of try again sir I don't know give me an example of something that shouldn't have support everything should have support because how else are you going to get customer
feedback literally if we didn't have LTT store support how would we ever improve yeah but that's a store that's like a that's a very different situation okay fine if we didn't have FL plane support how would we improve float plane is a pay to access service everything is paid though everything's paid you pay with your attention looking at ads you pay with your personal information you pay with your credit card you pay for everything everything's paid so I not there's no free
lunch yeah I can't think of examples right now small Linux dros uh Linux support for Linux dros I think there are some like support forums would that count I think that support Forum count stck overflow um you know what no I well H see here's my problem because I think in the case of something like a like a Linux drro I I actually would say that yeah I think that I think that counts I think that's valid right if it's a community created community supported product then I think it can be
yeah then it can be community supported Community created can be community supported but the fact that Microsoft for example has that I forget what it's called like Microsoft answers or like what's it called give give me a second I'll get there so the fact that Microsoft relies on community contributors to answer support inquiries for freaking Windows yeah it's ridiculous is actually comical and actually very annoying to be honest like actually comical because it basically
just gives them a shield to put in front of themselves to not have to fix things that are problems if they were if they were actually accountable if if they had to pay if they had to pay billable hours to employees or contractors to sit and explain to people why freaking search doesn't work if that was actually on their books we might get a different response from them about it maybe they might actually fix it or it would just be canned responses being because eventually
eventually like someone would look at it and go H it might actually be cheaper to just develop a fix to this oh they just script A can response everybody and not actually deal with them turn it AI um but yeah what about this what about it that's a that's a forum where's support uh you hold on no no no we have we have we have you can contact an admin or moderator we literally have that I'm going to find it I'm going to find it smart guy it's not official support though so well hold on staff okay line is
Tech and I'm not logged in but you can literally send me a message but that's not support no it's not but hold on hold on hold on okay by the way don't bother because I don't reply to them anymore but um no no I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure there's uh I'm pretty sure there's stuff hold on I'm going to find it he hasn't found it yet Forum support we'll find it event there we go there it's right there we totally have support now I knew we had support smart guy we 100% do you know why we have that support
though because you should have support no for gdpr forget me requests uh sort of actually but it's because we we did sales through the form okay but we would need it anyway and we would totally have it anyway no I I I'm not you know what I'm going to die on this hill every service that is customer facing consumer facing and anyone who pays you in any way whether it's with their blood or their DNA freaking collection companies man 23 implosion is terrifying if you're not terrified of that you should be
terrified of that even if you never sent your genetic information to them if anyone even kind of related to you did you could be like that whole thing sucks and I'm super angry about it still I'm probably screwed and just don't know you're actually screwed and do know um what was I going to say would you would you accept some form of threshold of like revenue for the company or something like that like there's a lot of laws like flow planes protected by amount of these where if if you're if
you're below a certain amount of Revenue certain laws don't take place yet I think as long as we also account for well we have like very little Revenue but we do have a casual like N9 billion dollar in seed funding like I I think I think basically once a once a certain amount of money is flowing in some way I'm done with that you should support the product so once you either have a certain amount of Revenue or have raised a certain amount of dollars um I'd be completely fine with that I just think I
I think this has there there's a lot of these types of laws that I see come in that to a certain degree seem designed to benefit big players and like some some random little Forum or some random little thing here or there that like you know maybe they do make money off of it um I would they probably actually do have support team boo suggests that another threshold could be users and I I think that's valid that's an interesting one um there's a contact is there actually a support though wow this website is
rough um I just went to paint.net oh yeah good old paint.net the email is not for technical support or troubleshooting there's a forum linked below there's an example yep there's just a support Forum please ask our Forum but isn't isn't paint.net uh like open source there's a donate button yeah but that's uh I I again you said any Sider service no what I said is that it if if it is community created then it can be community supported so I said the Forum is valid for that okay
okay I don't remember that bit but I believe you I was probably thinking about something else oh okay chicken probably I haven't eaten today so maybe maybe um yeah I don't know I think if there was some amount of yeah either a user count or a revenue count or freeware not open source sorry sorry and and yes this is a really good point vng Supernova says open source doesn't mean Community created um that's also very true actually it often means limited amount of contributors because
uh because I don't know either there often isn't that many contributors or it's people that just want credit for job applications um uh hex do says no chance with Elon as part of the next us Administration doesn't Tesla even have PR anymore they don't have PR but what they do have is customer support they actually they they do have support if you are an individual end user you can 100% contact Tesla but whatever issue you're having with your model whatever um so let's just let you know look I'm
not a fan of a lot of stuff that he's done especially over the last few years there seems to be kind of this weird kind of turn that he's taken uh but let's let's not uh let's not make  um yeah migu says Elon is their PR department For Better or For Worse that is a true statement uh let's maybe move on to I've yeah I've got to get out of here in like 40 minutes oh do you okay uh let's move on to our sponsors then cool what has this show even been about so far we're going to have to get

40% off on select shoes you can step into the season with Comfort style and savings if you don't know vessie they offer all kinds of stylish functional shoes for everyday wear uh sorry I'm deviating from my talking points a little bit here I had no idea they had a store in metrot town yeah yeah like a physical store I hadn't been to metr town in like 8 years I haven't seen it cuz I haven't been there since they open the store but I just know that cool uh our team loves their vessies because
here in Vancouver the weather is always so unpredictable I actually hate this talking point uh because the weather in Vancouver is not unpredictable it's extremely predictable it rains which doesn't change the fact that vessis are good for it it just is very predictable their new Courtside Classics bring that Sport and retro everyday look with a padded tongue for extra Comfort or if you're more of a wild adventure their storm burst high tops combine the comfort of a sneaker with the grip and
coverage of an outdoor boot so step into water resistant comfort with vess's Black Friday sale where you can enjoy up to 40% off select what they say are waterproof Styles at vy.com and my my hesitation there guys my hesitation there is that I have a belief this is a core belief of mine that nothing is waterproof if water can can carve can carve chasms into the face of the Earth then it can with enough time um break down just about anything so water is patient so that
that's that's my only thing I don't call anything waterproof um finally the show is brought to you by server part deals oh okay I know about dropping things but I'm not the only one sometimes your package might be dropped even harder by The Courier imagine if your wife's anniversary gift is in that box or even worse your hard drive our sponsor server partner deals thought about that they sell recertified refurbished and new hard drives and have a growing collection of Enterprise ssds
to avoid that kind of tragedy they offer some of the best packaging in the industry they've custom designed both their individual and bulk packaging and offer free 2-day shipping and it says show the packaging on camera for a better environment this container was not bleached white I know okay very cool  wa and we've got some boes the cushions in this box are manufactured from 100% postc consumer recycled plastic cool oh that's nice uh it genuinely looks very cushioned wow that is a yeah that a firm
cushion oh okay oh neat yeah this is different from what I've seen before so you kind of go like this and then your hard drive comes out and that's a casual  there very cool is that one of ours uh oh yeah look we've inventoried it that might be for mother Vault please don't drop that one oh okay although if it was in the packaging it wouldn't matter right so what you're saying is that I should drop it but I should just put it back in here first right Dan yeah that's probably from one of the VDS is Liv so
if we lose that drive we'll lose the entirety of the mother Vault what really no we like to live dangerously no there's no way that's true stop it silvering takes 8 days we wouldn't we no we wouldn't do that yeah okay Dan but I bet but I'm sure you could so many levels why would that have been done yeah anyway um uh they test every single Drive they sell even manufacturer recertified drives go through read WR speed testing and sector scanning and they have their smart data checked for bad and
reallocated sectors they have many manufacturer recertified drives that are only a fraction of the price of brand new ones while still delivering reliable performance if you need help their customer service Luke is not outsourced and can be store and can be reached through live chat or calls check out server part deals at serverpartdeals.com LTT and use code LTT to get 5% off on any order which might not sound like a super deep discount code but guys you got to understand this is a very very
different Slimmer business model than a lot of other um you know services and products online that literally will have like 25 30 points baked into them so that they can offer a discount um yeah that 5% off on hard drives is like good so uh go for it I'm also told that they actually sent us that hard drive too oh okay they sent the hard drive okay hey thanks oh so that's just like legitimately exactly how it was packaged because they yeah that's how it was sented that makes sense and then we owned it which
destroyed the entire bit but okay neat okay um I want to talk about this the topic is y'all don't seem to want actual Tech tips yeah I uh I saw this did you did you did you check out the video I checked out the video um there was also if I remember correctly there was actually a Reddit thread talking about how good parts of the video were even though the person recognized I I think it was about this video I don't remember I'm I'm I didn't know this was going to be a topic in the doc so I
didn't prep for this um how good parts of the video were even though they're usually just interested in the entertainment parts of the video they saw how it was like connected to real world things they like wow this is really cool and I was like yeah so we did a video this week that has changed titles a couple times because it's performing trying to make it work terribly and basically it was it was me and Elijah and I got to give some credit to plof who was actually the one who did
the Facebook Marketplace dump diving before uh the project got passed to Elijah to get it across the Finish Line um and but right now it's called I built an insane surround sound setup for under $250 and the original title focused on um building a a home an entire home theater for less than the price of the the most popular soundar and I don't know if the Bose TV speaker is the most popular soundar today but it was the last time we did why is everybody buying this uh this Soundbar it was it was the
most popular Soundbar on I believe Amazon was the platform that we were using for that series at that time and the amount of criticism for this video slash the extremely low performance of this video has been a little demoralizing for me to be perfectly honest with you I've seen a lot of people that are kind of dunking on it for being you know another another Facebook Marketplace video um I've seen a fair number of people dunking on it because we're comp comparing against a
new soundar instead of comparing against a secondhand Soundbar so they see it as kind of like an unfair fight um I've seen quite a few people say that um you know the odds of them being able to find the exact parts that we're using are basically zero therefore this is not applicable to anybody and I got to say guys I I don't know I I I don't know I don't know how to deal I don't know how to deal with that and if the video was performing great like if it was getting a ton of views um then it would be fine
but I guess what I'm trying to say is like I'm looking at this going like real Tech tips might not be sustainable like if this Tye if people are what did I do what can I do differently I guess is what I'm asking because like to to your like what you said is is exactly right like that's that's not the point the point is not finding the exact AV receiver that we did yeah the point is the journey did did you watch the video by any chance it wasn't this one I watched a different one so basically what we what
we did was we we got a few different options we started land Center audio one got it uh we started with an old home theater in the Box um so it was it was a number of years old and it was probably around 500 bucks when it was new but it was like 40 bucks today which realistically for those kind of lowquality semi- proprietary um surround Solutions probably more like it um they they tend to be a little bit overpriced at MSRP but if you can get them on clearance they can actually be a pretty
great deal um so we started with one of those and showed that even for $40 on like a Marketplace site like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace we could absolutely obliterate this thing we we were unflinching in our acknowledgement of the the inconvenience and and the wiring mess um that was another thing man I saw people like defending Soundbar super hard for the ease of use and I'm like guys we we acknowledged that so directly that I I just um I I just I don't know uh I don't I
don't know how I don't know how we can acknowledge it more uh we we stepped it up by upgrading our left and rights so that you know particularly for watching anything with music in it which is like all content uh we could get a a bit better of a of a soundtrack experience uh we upgraded our amplifier or maybe we upgraded the amp fire before we changed the speed whatever we but we got a cheap AVR um and with the intention not of using it for video switching because you can't use an older one for video
switching if you want to run like a you know a modern 4K display or whatever the case may be so we got an old amp and old amps like they they're they're still great amplifiers if you buy something that was decent 10 years ago 15 years ago you can still get a really nice amplifier um and then you just don't run your video through it which for most people is fine because your TV is probably going to have anywhere from two on the very very low end to four inputs anyway so you just run everything
through there and then uh we added a subwoofer and then we added some cheap towers that we got and the final configuration was probably around $240 compared to the Bose TV speaker which is $250 um and our our point was just and and there were so many Tech tips along the way I guess is what I'm trying to get to here sort of talking about speaker impedance best practices uh talking about uh what you can do if you don't have EC support on your receiver so talking about uh Optical connections
and the and the good things about it and the limitations of it um and I uh I think honestly past a certain view count there just isn't really room for it um maybe I'm being too Doomer about this I would like to think that I'm being too Doomer about this but I I don't necessarily think I am I think a pretty good example of this of is maybe Michael Reeves when you look at some of Michael Reeves videos if I remember correctly um his very early videos he talked more about the programming that was involved
and showed more of it and these days it's usually like a comical Montage where sections of the code like fly past the screen uh like it's it's it's different people don't actually care I know there was there was like if you think about old YouTube there was a lot of videos that were like tutorials on how to do something and then the people that were making the tutorials on how to do something videos realized that no one was actually doing it they were just watching them for the content so they tried to push
entertainment and it started leaving the actual tutorial space there's some really good Insight in float plane chat um like some people are saying yeah I really liked it to be clear I mean "900,000 plus people watched it and like" the like dislike ratio is fine like it's not like people are hating on it I'm just trying to figure out how to make like like someone someone here said uh where where's their comment um maybe it was just not that great of a video um can we just move on well no no no no no
no no the point is like I'm trying to figure out how to make this more accessible because I want people to save money like that's why that's why we do this in the that's why we started doing this in the first place right is is bringing the people Tech tips and we want to do it in in an entertaining way but but we want we want to we want to like help um so I so so I'm I'm trying to like figure this out um why does being critical of the content uh me and the video was bad well okay no no
there's hold on there's there's some there's some really good there's some really good comments uh on it so some people are saying in my area uh Marketplace especially for this kind of stuff is kind of terrible I sometimes have to travel a couple hours for a deal on gaming computers yeah well that that's a thing like that's a thing here too yeah and and we but we acknowledge the time spent in it and I think that like that mindset of like sort of bargain hunting is uh is what we're
trying to get across so maybe that's something that we need to acknowledge more directly is like hey this has a cost in time like do you think that's something that would help maybe um um I don't know was that not explained uh come bets and Bulls and says I found it a bit hard to get what the point of the video was I felt like it was a little bit all over the place so maybe it's something where we need a bit of a better summary or we a couple other comments like that we need more like
visuals to kind of drive it along uh Baga I think probably has the best comment I've seen on it so far I bet the same video would have blown up if you'd done 5 versus 50 versus 500 home theater speaker set up and that is that is that is probably the best maybe we just should uh maybe we should maybe we should revisit it and like keep that same stuff get a $5 option we've already got our $50 option we upgrade our our $250 option a little bit we take it to "500 bucks we get a $5,000 option and"
then we like contact some we contact Clips or something and we like borrow yeah we borrow like a "$50,000 option and then we just we do we" do it again um whatever Postman says as an AV professional I really enjoyed the video and the journey I guess maybe that's maybe that's the thing is maybe maybe the journey is too hard to follow along maybe like simplifying the format to like 5 versus 50 versus 500 is is the way to go I did see a fair amount of comments on like maybe there should have
been a a better explainer at the beginning uh because I didn't understand what the what the video was about Tesco says you called everyone out for making the worst choice you made your audience butt hurt I in this tweet and don't like it that's probably a good point too like are we so then is part of this that people are watching Tech tips just to be just to know their choice was validated as opposed to we've known that forever that has been true I can know something I can know something
cognitively without fully we legit talked about that being willing to  NC that makes me sad though yeah I know but why aren't we allowed to say hey this thing that's super popular is not that great like man do you remember when probably about like 9 years ago athm 50s these garbage headphones like popped off in popularity because of some some like I don't know they they got a lot of attention let's just say they got a lot of attention for a little while and you and I were both kind of sitting there
going like what what like people buy these because they're disposable rubbish that's why they use them in the studio not cuz they're good what is happening right now um and I I do genuinely think if we had come out and made a video when that Trend took off that was like the ATM 50s are not very good and people need to stop buying them we probably would have just gotten destroyed I think it's one of the two you either are right after or are the turn of the tide or you get slaughtered one
of the two if you're the turn of the tide then your video is going to explode but if people aren't ready for it yet so you're not the turn of the tide then they'll just crap on you Isaac V says it was hard to follow you scrambled a lot of parts and I didn't really get what was happening um by the way I would like a lot more technical details and what they're about okay but so those two things are definitely not going to work together um a ton more technical details is uh is going to make it a little
harder to follow I can I can I can promise you that but I do agree that kind of like in the last scrapyard Wars where we we went back we basically sent the edit back to the kitchen you never saw the original edit I sent the edit back to the kitchen I said look you guys take however much time you need and make sure that we have these onscreen visuals that make it really clear what parts we have now what we've added what we're subtracting who we're negotiating with and and where the money stands and even
then one prominent viewer couldn't figure out that I was never at a negative balance so yes you were that's in spite of our best efforts in spite of our best efforts yes you were schwifty says I totally watch reviews for things I've already bought and that's that sort of validates your validation seeking I do sometimes too but it's not necessarily it's like kind of to see where it's at if that makes sense um and there's there's products where like you know I'll I'll do some research on it
I'll buy it I'll try it out I'm like yeah like it's it's working but you know it's not 100% and then I'll see some new product comes out it'll get compared against that new product and then I'll be like ah yeah okay I probably should have waited this isn't great like I I allow my opinion to be changed um or honestly I'll sometimes buy something someone will review it against something else and say that it's crap versus the thing that they like and I'll be like yeah I just don't agree but
like that's fine Tim says there was a bit of difficulty when you were between the two systems like you had the center channel from this one but the receiver from another one I had a bit of difficulty knowing where the value was halfway through but it all kind of came together at the end and I think that is probably another like gold star good comment um because hard TR I still make videos with the intention that people watch the whole thing I know better than that yeah yeah you almost have to make
like multiple videos you almost yeah you need to have like the the payoff payoff payoff payoff and it kind of It kind of K 20% viewer video the 40% viewer video the 60% viewer video you can never have like where's he going with this um it always just has to be very clear and that's something that is easy for me to forget because I always kind of hard to write for I imagine um yes and no I mean that that five versus 50 versus 500 format that kind of flows yeah sure so yeah I guess you kind of have to
shoehorn into a format that works for it or it might be more difficult to write for I suspect that's the case um sock hadab says the established tiar seemed to borrow stuff from the others a bit too much which made it harder to follow for some reason yep I think that's I think that's very fair uh In fairness to me I didn't Source the stuff and so I didn't know exactly how it was all going to go together um so I was kind of I was kind of working with um with what I had but it it's that's really that's really
valid and I think that's something that I and the like the content team could have worked on ahead of time to make it more accessible by having like a a well understood format I think that's what it basically boils down to is we could have done a better job visually of showing exactly what it was we were doing and having a better established format wouldn't hurt I also think that some people kind of got fixated on details that didn't matter I saw I saw some people talking about how well I don't
even have a home theater room and it's like well no that's that's not the point we're shooting in here because it's really convenient um but you could do this anywhere and and I think a lot of  um oh okay yeah yeah I'm looking into booking a ride right now Lieutenant salty the video was important too many people have crappy sound bars and have no idea what they're missing yeah I mean that was why we did it I thought it was a really important video um mantisa says are you just focusing too much on a loud
minority no because the whole point of this is is that last thing that I just read so many people have the wrong thing and like need to hear this and it might not work for everybody not everybody has the space not everybody has the wife acceptance Factor to to be able to you know put a bunch of random speakers they found on Craigs List in in their living space right like it's not going to be applicable to everyone but I do think that before you make that decision you should be well informed that's it I want
people to make informed decisions and that was why we made that video like if you're interested in Tech like like if you're interested in Tech if you don't have a TV even I think it can still be an interesting Journey to see what someone would do to set up that type of a system yeah because surely you might have friends and you want to you want to be the knowledgeable Tech in your group I assume right like I'm I think so right okay all right why don't we jump into our next topic traffic's looking
good I can leave slightly later why we weren't able to say more oh all right great let's do a let's do another topic like that hooray um so a lot of people last week were upset frustrated disappointed that we weren't able to say more about the channel hiatuses last week and there are two main reasons uh number one is that it's the law um and and it's funny I ended up kind of in exchanges with a couple of people where I I said that and they were like yah but and I was like no there is
no yah but yeah it is just the law certain things it's it's completely inflexible I cannot disclose literally anything about someone else's personal life including their employment status I was just going to say and and to be honest for good reason sometimes it would be nice if you could but the the law should exist and that's number two because it's like the right thing to do um like let's say let's say hypothetically that you were no longer at your job tomorrow whether you quit or
you were laid off or you were fired sort of immaterial um during your exit interview the HR manager asks you hey do you mind if we talk about the circumstances on our podcast you would think they lost their fuing minds right but that is what a a not insignificant number of people were asking me to do to be fair about me in particular I wouldn't necessarily think that but it would still be the law yes um and it doesn't matter how much anyone externally feels like they're entitled
to it they're not yeah they're not entitled to it 100% um I saw some suggestions that we just provide information about the folks that we're parting amicably with for example nope well we always try to part amicably but it's not always possible and the issue there is that if we acknowledge some folks and not others it's pretty easy to do the the math um simple deductive logic and then uh and then the conjecture starts right we used to talk about stuff way more like we'd bring
people onto the podcast on their last day or like Nick van burkel for example is an example he for example is an example yeah he he made like a like a farewell video on channel super fun um but what we've realized over time is that it's not a sustainable practice because as soon as there isn't a farewell video or an announcement or whatever the case may be um people start speculating and the and the the rumor mill spins so much faster than we can possibly respond to any of it
um I also saw some folks that were asking for way more detail about the business decision side of things again though let's put yourself in their shoes okay Luke you are no longer working on a project okay and someone else who has a way louder megaphone than you goes and talks about whatever it is that led for your project to be shelved or canceled or whatever else you think do you think that would reflect on you a little bit possibly maybe yes it could it could affect uh future employment
potential um it it would it would be a blow to morale immediately for sure I would be frustrated about that because like there's almost no way that they're going to say everything and there's no way that we're going to say like we if something got cancelled right almost certainly there was something that went wrong with it at some point in some way uh or right so so if I were to say like hey um we're going to talk about all of the uh completely unsustainable practices at float plane
that led for it to be sheld nice you're going to be like excuse me yeah um and and then and then right it creates this like this this background drama um well you were supposed to be the business arm exactly exactly which you know is valid um also float plane is not unsustainable the reason we're using Luke as an example and the reason we're using his project as an example is just illustrative it's to show you guys why these conversations don't take place in public and shouldn't and just because
we've made mistakes in the past doesn't mean that we should just continue to make them in the name of like what morbid curiosity like that's not that's not a good reason um so I'm really sorry to have disappointed some of you um looking at the comments from last week's W show quite a few members of our community were extremely upset and I think that a big part of that is on me I I should have explained this in more detail um I I do this thing sometimes where I think that stuff is sort of
self-evident um and and it's not because people live in all kinds of different places around the world where where laws and and norms are different um people come from all different walks of life uh people have their own value systems um so to me this one was obvious based on all the experience that I've had doing it the other way and seeing what an absolute cluster it is um you guys don't have that experience so you didn't know um this isn't a choice that helps I don't benefit from not offering
explanations or justifications for the actions of our team or our company that that doesn't help me when the rumor mill swirls because I can't give additional details about something I don't benefit guys um but it is a choice that is designed not for my benefit not for your benefit it's designed to minimize the impact on our team members both current and former don't expect this policy to be altered going forward because you'd be wrong cool good chat yeah do you want to talk about uh full screen ads for
co-pilot plus PCS on Windows 10 so sick this is pretty cool Microsoft is aggressively prompting Windows 10 users to upgrade employing fullcreen ads that highlight Windows 11 features particularly those on co-pilot plus PCS these ads coincide with the approaching end of free security updates for Windows 10 in October 2025 while an extended security update or ESU program exists for a fee the ads predominantly push new pc purchases this aggressive marketing tactic isn't new for Microsoft they've
used similar methods for past OS upgrades um sometimes just forcing them on you anyways um and users can still upgrade to Windows 11 directly on compatible PCS as an alternative discussion question is where's the limit every mainstream non-linux operating system and even some of the Linux based ones would fall under the definition of adware at this point uh yeah yeah definitely where's my iPhone here hold on I haven't used Mac OS do they have ads baked into Mac OS I have I have literally check this out
hold on hold on hold on give me used Mac but not actively give me a sec check this out I didn't notice any uh I have I I have left them because I I wanted to I wanted to remember how many there were I have mac doesn't have ads so that's not that's not correct I have three Mac OS never prompts you to like buy iCloud are you sure uh no what I'm saying okay fair enough what I'm saying is that uh Windows has other ads well BS in ads from everybody it's not even just their own
stuff yeah I I'm sorry but I don't I don't I don't have I don't think there's I don't draw a distinction that's fair enough um okay so uh so on iOS right now my Apple account suggestions I have three persistent notifications in my settings app for this um my iPhone's not backed up okay that's valid however my second notification is your iPhone can't be backed up upgrade for a129 a month and then my third notification is some iCloud data isn't syncing which again is related to me not having enough
storage with they which they have kindly offered to solve for me for money um and then I have I mean that is how that would work I have three well no they could allow me to quickly back up to my Nas or my computer remember can you do that in another way with third party app back I mean maybe but I don't have I don't have an ad from Apple about that Apple doesn't notify me that that's a possibility uh so is this in your settings thing or yeah I don't know it's right it's in my well no I I got
notifications for them at some point okay oh yeah and then I have uh I have three notifications for services included with purchase let's see what do I have I get Apple TV free for three months uh I get Apple news the purchase of the phone yeah but of course I'm going to have to sign up for a subscription that is going to that's a very generous 3 months thank you very much for after my you know "$1,100 or $1,200 phone or whatever this" is um but uh I'm I'm going to end up I'm
going to end up with subscriptions at some point um yeah oh people are really mad about you uh I bet about you thinking that like they shouldn't offer or okay hold on hold on hold on okay guys no no no I am not I am not necessarily saying that Apple should be oh no I think I I yeah I think they should be be forced to to present me with with a with an with an alternative option no actually no I do you know what I do think that uh one person's just particularly mad because Apple's limit
has been five gigs basically forever and they've done that intentionally knowing that you're going to have to buy yeah but they don't have to provide that no but I think the thing I think the thing that is bad is that they they don't give me a free alternative if they're going to give you a native notification yes and not give a free alternative that's pretty annoying if it's just in your settings thing and it's like hey you could do this that's not too big of a deal to me personally but giving you
notifications yeah breaks that line especially because they used to you used to be able to quickly and easily just plug a cable into your computer and back up to iTunes yeah yeah but no they want you to buy cloud storage now um people are saying you can back up your phone over USB still so I guess the frustrating thing is just that they aren't presenting that oh apparently Apple's being sued over this in the UK  uh yeah you can still use iTunes so that's good they just don't tell you so
back to what I said in the beginning I think they should present you with the free option yeah cool rather than just saying hey oh no oh my God your iPhone's not backed up buy storage buy cloud storage from us mhm wow good guy UK good job well that's a valid reason to want uh usb3 on the iPhone I actually didn't really think about that when we uh when we talked about the um the original implementation of USBC on the iPhone 15 family I didn't think about faster backups with the pro versions that have
uh I believe it's 5 gigabit per second right is it five or 10 I think it's five pixel pixel bugs you to buy drive storage um but one kind of point that I will give to them and I don't know if iOS does this is it will also suggest that you like delete old photos that it thinks are like just of garbage um if it's like like a parking location or something that you like it doesn't think you need anymore it'll be like hey you can get rid of all this stuff or like hey you haven't opened this app in like
a year you should just uninstall it like it'll give you suggestions on reducing your the amount of data that you have which I think is kind of neat but they do try to push you to buy more D Kumo star in float plane chat made a really good point what's really ridiculous is they've had time time machine on Mac OS for like a bazillion years and didn't ever let you do that on the iPhone there is absolutely no reason from like an ecosystem user experience standpoint that I shouldn't be able to just arrive
at home and my iPhone shouldn't just Wi-Fi sync to my time machine that I literally already have because I literally already have a Mac apparently Apple does that too I don't know I I don't use iOS I wasn't saying in contrast to Apple I was just saying that I do like that they do that yeah to be clear we started this segment with like every mainstream operating system is functionally adwar now yeah um and it's it's really frustrating apparently you can Wi-Fi sync to iTunes well why not 
machine is there a reason to not be able to do that to my Nas that supports time machine I don't know man I just it just it doesn't seem it doesn't seem intuitive no one's fighting that deep deep blue says Luke why does the pixel not prompt me to add a different cloud account like Dropbox or next ploud when I don't have enough drive storage I'm not I'm not defending Google in in this isn't this isn't man you start talking about Android or iOS and people just immediately um it it's this isn't oh
Wi-Fi syn versus the other is apparently not automatic um and Archangel of death says it would be too convenient of an alternative to buying more iCloud yes yes that's that's the whole point that's what we're trying to say also I don't want to back up to my desktop PC because I don't want to have a raid array in my desktop PC I want to back up to my Nas I want to use time machine like if I was an Apple user that is what I would want I would want it to go to time machine that would be sick also super time
machine is cool time machine has always been cool to be honest it is so cool and it's like it's not even it's one of those things that's not even like unique like snapshot based backup tools have existed for billion years it's good and it's integrated um um and the only reason for them to not build a good integrated thing is so that they can sell you their own storage solution their own cloud storage yeah um anyway this is super cool this is the last thing that we really need to talk
about before you go have you seen the land party house oh I was wondering if you were going to see this yes I have what the heck you should like go or something I would actually love to the way pretty cool dude the way that this room folds up dude it's so sick all yeah you can so so close station to the right it just looks like the wall and you can see so the the doors at the bottom support the desk like oh man this is so cool incredibly thoughtful DDR panels under the floor they show someone
actually using them later cool um the upstairs office we can game here too yep and there's uh there's keyboard like what looks like pull out keyboard trays or no that might just be keyboard storage I'm not sure cuz this one's just kind of sitting here like this it's even better than that that is so cool flip up monitors that is wild oh wait yeah yeah yeah wow so that was literally a keyboard you saw they just flip it up that is so cool just extra I I hadn't looked through the
whole thing pre-show cuz I wanted to I wanted to do it live Cable Management stealthy stealthy absolutely love it killer conduit it look at this look at this they've got actual like cable trays up in the ceiling just like you have like a data center call Rooms like they're in an office look at this that's so sick look at this this is hilarious 20 identical machines personal desktops door leads to the hot side oh my goodness this is so cool dude it's wicked this is so cool apparently like a
million uh Eads this photo has made a lot of network Engineers angry oh cuz they're not using a patch panel response in the Q&amp;A okay yeah this was a mistake I'm a software guy yeah fair enough sounds good got you got you 2 gbit per second fiber internet this is crazy look at this can you imagine like working at the you know the Micro Center yeah when someone comes in like hey I'll take everything yeah thank you how many uh I'd like to I'd like to buy a 4070 how many yes yeah um that was I guarant to
you that was fun as hell assembly yeah man dude look at this space I it's just so it's so enticing yeah beautiful the house has normal Parts too yeah love to see it dude look at this yep cat door leads into the kids' bedrooms I love it I I have wanted to do this since before we moved into our new place like little cat shelves and stuff on the wall just haven't gotten around to it apparently one of their parents is like um like Works in architectural design or something sorry Cloud flare oh
no no no no no the oh oh oh I understand I understand and and and kind of helped with this and has like designed some pretty cool stuff got a couple work from home call Rooms clearly does a good job cat restrooms like really man seriously though if I were to design my own house from scratch I would % do it if you never have to look at it and smell it like man cats are like the best pets ever the worst thing about them is the litter dude so cool oh it's space under the stairwells dude I could totally
convert one of those spaces in my place to uh to a cat bathro dude the downstairs one definitely I should do that and the and the main stairwell I could totally make a little door in there and I don't know how humans would access it but cats definitely could um couple guest rooms dude this roof deck like what like freaking what oh cool amazing um yeah super super cool project I I would love to come check it out I'm in I'm inviting I'm inviting myself to to go to a tour I
mean honestly I think they already did like a great job of doing a tour of the place but I still would love to just check it out and geek out over it yeah incredible someone one uped my host land Center oh yeah it's a great title yeah yeah it's a great title slightly better than that they also they didn't one up it they like six up kind of smashed it a little bit yeah like I didn't even think about having people just keeps going they're like oh you thought we had one land Center no what about second land C
like it's crazy I love it so sick I'm I'm I'm it's impressive to see anyone that dedicated to pretty much anything yeah and because it happens to be something that I think is super cool and I'm also into uh it's that much cooler yeah I think they did an amazing amazing job of their setup uh do you need to go you you you're like getting pretty anxious here so that that's fine get get out of here okay get out of here uh after dark you want to finish the topics what do you want to yeah I'll finish off
the topics and then we could do a couple merch messages I guess it'll just be me and you Dan let's see yep that that there's only a couple I'm so excited for this Android will apparently finally be able to instantly log you into your apps on new devices this has been a huge pain point for me because I have so many like accounts and and two factors and dependencies that I basically cannot use a phone until probably 3 or 4 hours after I first start setting it up and it's annoying because for my job I
switch phones a lot more than probably most people and I have like I have like I get like anxiety when I need to switch phones Google has announced restore credentials which will allow apps to seamlessly log users into their accounts on new Android device after user restores their apps and data from a previous device oh if they can do it in a way that's like secure that's yeah that's why I started looking at this we look I'm so excited I just can't hide it I think this particularly for reviewers
is going to be amazing the user experience should be as if they had already been using the new device receive notifications from apps that have not yet been opened on the new device how it works signing into an app on the old device will create a restore key which is stored locally and backed up to the cloud apps can opt out of cloud backup don't you dare the restore key is a public key compatible with pass key2 backends and uses the same serers side implementation as pass Keys when
setting up the new device the user can restore data from a cloud backup or transfer data locally why is Google doing this is a question here I I I I don't care I'm not asking that it's great am I am I does this counter my rant about Google early in the show not doing anything this is innovation I am like this is actually pretty cool so excited about this okay my ride's going to be here in 2 minutes I'm going to go according to the Android developer blog 40% of people in the US reset or replace
their smartphone every year that's a big one forget even like getting a new phone the number of device manufacturers where you're like hey I'm having a problem and their immediate response is to heart to reset the phone it's like do you have any idea how much work homework you just gave me resetting my phone that  sucks anyway um they say that making the process of logging back into apps on a new phone much faster and easier will help avoid app abandonment and user turn
okay well that part of it I'm not that into if it's just to like make sure I keep paying my subscriptions like a good little boy but um whatever I still love it um oh hold on the Android developer blog apparently the 40% is probably an overestimate uh our notes Here say that's probably incorrect various statistics have it at more like 10 to 20% Max but anyway I'm in that 10 to 20% and so I'm extremely extremely excited about this and I I can't overstate how excited I am about it um our last topic
which I'm less excited about is Microsoft ignite 2024 there is some good  um Microsoft announced the Windows resiliency initiative uh quick machine recovery allows it admins to remotely apply fixes to PCS that can't boot so this is in response to the crowd strike issue earlier this year um Windows 11 Enterprise now supports hot patching in public preview no reboot required okay that is pretty cool administrator protection standard users can temporarily gain admin privileges by
authenticating with Windows hello and more and then next up we've got the Windows 365 link this is a little less exciting a $350 Edge PC that only serves as a client to access a Windows 365 Cloud PC it supports dual 4K monitors has four USB ports and ethernet port Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 and will be available in April 20125 my only question is why does this need to exist in a world where the Mac Mini also exists Cloud powered performance the Mac Mini is a RI and fast PC for yes more
but I would say considering that it is a full fat like awesome PC for that price is um a lot more compelling but hey we we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes Microsoft also announced new AI powered customizable co-pilot agents that are rolling out in Microsoft 365 AKA office like the facilitator agent which can take real-time notes during teams meetings and chats which is in public preview now uh we use a third party tool for that so this is actually kind of useful for us uh interpreter
agent which provides real-time speech to speech interpretation during meetings even optionally simulating the user's voice public preview in early 2025 and an Employee Self-Service agent which can answer common policy questions and facilitate tasks related to HR and IT okay maybe I'm maybe I'm getting more excited it was just the uh it was just the Windows 365 link that I was like um because Microsoft 365 is all co-pilot aied Microsoft is adding a little co-pilot badges to the app icons for
word excel PowerPoint Etc and best of all they're changing the Microsoft 365 logo to something pretty similar to the co-pilot logo but with an M365 badge this is a terrible logo um huh oh wow it says please watch this 10-second clip with audio to hear ignite attendees enthusiasm for this change sure you've got some audio playing some mute something else first uh yeah I will do that give me one sec I I I would imagine they're going to sound about like what I just sounded like
looking at that logo I I had not um I had not seen that yet and it is not very good here we go all right 10c clip Dan should it work yep okay here we go icon  oh boy you wow o that was the shortest polite Applause that I think I have ever heard  keynote wow uh this last part is actually super cool also rolling out now now for meta Quest 3 and 3s users is is the ability to access a local or cloud-based Windows instance and interact with multiple virtual monitors that's uh that's looking pretty
cool and uh comes at a much lower price than an apple Vision Pro and a Macbook so uh I can see people being pretty stoked on that one as well good gravy was that ever Savage though wow I I think I might even even as much as I don't like it I think I could probably muster a little bit more fake enthusiasm than that yikes all right why don't we switch over to when after dark Mr Dan besser can do whoa we need to switch the W show to this time forever our concurrence on YouTube are
like 15% 20% higher than usual that's higher than a very high I'm showing 16 oh no there we go everybody stopped watching uh yeah yeah yeah we should do that oh man I don't want to get up early on Fridays though me too this sucks uh it's "actually 5,000 YouTube is there's an" error uh yeah yeah it's a reporting error the dashboard is broken um exactly oh crap okay you know what's funny is we always did it at the later time because and I I don't want to make anyone else feel
unappreciated but we always did it at the later time because um the Australian crew was like so into being able to catch wano and so vocal about it that we picked the afternoon on Fridays because it would be um not a work night for the east coast in North America so they could kind of stay up and watch it and it would be uh in the morning for the Australians to watch and we've just kind of we just kind of um we our our European audience was a lot less vocal and a lot a lot smaller
back then and so we have we have always been kind of aie uh Aussie accommodating and maybe it's because I don't know maybe it's because I kind of think of Australians as probably one of the closest cultures to Canada um maybe I felt like some kinship you know we're both kind of like they're like sorry but with spiders yeah we're still kind of Commonwealth but like you know kind of King Charles you know like I don't know we just always kind of seemed we always kind of seemed on the same page
about things but um yeah this is wow this is this is a lot um this is a lot uh a lot higher viewership than usual I hadn't looked at the analytics Nei yeah no this is uh concerning huh outlier um okay yeah maybe who know well I'm not promising anything because the work week is very challenging here in a lot of ways and I'm often mentally really tired like I to be clear I don't think that I work a a hard manual labor job or anything like that but it can be mentally very
exhausting and uh early morning on my on my Fridays is not my favorite time to have to be like on for 2 to four hours that's another thing too is doing it at the end of the workday on Friday means that we can just kind of like not disturb anybody and we can go for as long as we need to until yeah we're blocking like three or four sets right now we can't do a short circuit nobody can come in the building we can't do Tech linked nobody can be upstairs uh it's why do you keep moving
yourself you're the you're my only co-host right now D oh yeah I keep forgetting about that uh I should try and move the camera over slightly if I can do that with this might not be a terrible idea anyway yeah so okay I didn't consider that so there definitely won't be any changes anytime soon but um yeah I'm definitely I'm definitely liking y'all hanging out with us that's pretty cool it's kind of fun all right want to hit me with uh a handful of merch messages and then I
guess we should get out of people's way yeah probably uh let's see with graphics card running hotter and the 490 already being a 60 mm thick will we eventually see Tower coolers a standard would you consider janking one together for a current or next gen I mean dude I I I would have a few short years ago I would have said no that's just a silly mod that people do and uh we're always going to need to keep our slots open for additional addin cards and then what add-in cards do people even
install anymore what are we supposed to to like most motherboards like they they high-end motherboards this is a funny thing it used to be pisses me off so much dude remember remember when high-end motherboards had more PCI slots yeah I will pay more for extra cuz I need a lot of PCI cards sometimes yeah now it's like yeah basic boards especially like matx matx is one that drives me absolutely Bonkers because the high-end ones will remove pcie slots but they're not even full-size ATX board so
they don't have like five or six m.2 slots on them so I'm sitting here going what did you do with the lanes why am I paying extra for this if you're not putting like a plx chip on it and and giving me all the slots what what happened basic matx boards have all the slots what's happening here um exactly and so yeah now that this trend of people only install gpus in their systems because gpus cost so much we can't afford other cards just not not the real reason but I don't know May might be a
contributor um I don't know I mean what I will say is that I wouldn't be surprised if 90 coolers are about the same size as 490 coolers even with the rumored increase in TDP and the reason for that is that the rumor is that 4090 coolers were designed for a much higher TDP because Nvidia kind of rug pulled the their board Partners on what the exact heat output of the card was going to be so I don't think they're going to get bigger in the Next Generation but with that said man I
don't think anything things off the table anymore oh man dude how cool would it be Dan if we had uh oh I guess I should look this way at you even though you're physically over there yeah sure that works uh oh my goodness uh how cool would it be if we had a standard where your kind of like the old trash can Mac Pro right where you got your CPU socket and then you've got your GPU and the D on the top and you could just do like a gigantic combo cooler and then just have like front to back air that goes right
through it ah yeah I'd like that or that be sick like you could have your CPU Cooler here and then maybe another thing that kind of wraps around it right so you can still remove them or you could move the CPU socket more to the right of the board yeah uh and then you could um because you'd have such a large cooler like a GPU even though it kicks out so much heat is a larger die it's easier to move the heat away from so you could cool your smaller die CPU where you really need that temperature
differential between the the air and the and the fins um or rather and and the and the and the processor itself and then you could take that semi heated air blow that through like a big a large cooler for the GPU so you could you could either do them seral or you could do them uh like split like you could have the CPU on the one side and the GPU on the one side and then you could just have like a tunnel that you're blowing air down that kind of cools each on both sides or I think probably the most
effective design would be like the trash can which really did a great job of cool of removing that much heat for for its size and for its noise and then you would just have like heat P pipes coming off the GPU heat pipes coming off the CPU into just like a great big fin stack that would be freaking cool yeah maybe we should start seeing like you know CPU chips just come as a chip when can we get gpus that do that oh it's never going to happen I know it would be nice never going to happen I think I think
what pisses me off mostly about the new motherboards these days is again yeah lack of PCI Lan um PCI gen came out all the boards put it on it it has like a thousand PCI Gen 4 Lanes what speed do uh gpus run out lonus PCI gen 4times 8 for now for now for now I I would like to see I'd like to see the desktop use the additional bandwidth of PCI Gen 5 differently I would actually rather than see a pcie by 16 GPU slot I would like to see everyone get together and kind of go heyy can we all acknowledge that 16
current generation Lanes is utterly unnecessary and can we start putting adex slots as our primary GPU slot and using those Lanes somewhere else having more slots having more IO uh having more more storage ports you know I I I I but the new consumer the PCI 5 came out I I need the new nice big thing that's the new number right well hold on there is I see PCI Gen 4 * X you know I've got a motherboard that has seven PCI slots uh I know what I'm buying average consumer sees top-of-the-line board PCI
Gen 5 they know that it they don't know that the gpus don't even run at the speeds I have a justification Dan I have a justification for this go for it if I still had a 16x slot right PCI Gen 5 16 and a pcie Gen 6 card comes out right I could take that I could put it in my Gen 5 slot and I'd still be getting half of its total theoretical bandwidth if we move to bu8 interfaces um I will be getting now and we get like a 16x card and I put it in my 8X slot that's a gen old I will be
getting a quarter of the theoretical bandwidth which could actually impact performance another thing um a lot of the CPU and Northbridge like lanes are shared if I put too many nvme drives in it disables PCI slots if I put too many SATA drives in it disables PCI slots what if you just give me eight slots on the board and then we can adjust which ones are active or not dude Ser server boards kind of what I'm talking about that's basically how they work now is you don't even have slots on them they
just have those little um what what's that mini whatever connector called uh Jake sent me the wildest looking board that was pretty I think it was from ASRock rack where it just had had no slots on it and just the entire bottom of the board was covered in those uh those pcie Riser connectors and I was like oh my gosh that's so cool because then you can you just design your chassis around that and you just like carry PCI wherever you want it storage devices gpus basically uh that would be
super nice like taking the PCI standard to its logical conclusion and just making everything like an add-in card yeah not ocul link it's it's the it's the newer one I I it's it's escaping me right now um I've no idea yeah I I can't remember no it's not oculink oh yeah bifurcation is another huge thing I've got a quad m.2 Drive thing in there adding cable cost though is going to is going to kill the deal on consumer like for servers yes but not for not for yeah but it gives manufacturers the
opportunity to sell more dongles yeah I mean they think of the dongles line I like it they'll love it they'll push it for just that I think case it would really change case design that would be that would be super cool if all of a sudden you could kind of like creatively Mount cards anywhere but looking at how little adoption we've seen for for PCI risers like it's still niche in the small form factor space or like the vertical mounts like it's still I would say at most probably 1% of PCS
if you factor in prebuilds probably less like I I just don't think most people are going to be willing to absorb that additional that additional cost probably not all right what what else we got to today okay thanks for the early show now I can watch it work since I work in a data center myself I love that video tour uh was there anything that you learned that you want to apply to your H's pool Loop uh those Leak Detection cords are super cool like being able to know exactly where it is but but no um
the the cost of implementing things the way that they do them is why we didn't do it that way it's not because we like didn't think of it uh it's yeah it's it's super cool to like see it all done right i' I'd say the one thing that we are legitimately considering because we've had multiple power outages here at the office in the last couple of weeks because of uh storms in the in the southwestern BC area is diesel generator backups uh we're we're getting pretty darn tired of our power going out um
but like we can't afford to have you know an onsite you know fuel purify and like so it's going to be someone's job to micromanage like making sure we have non stale diesel fuel on site all the time and I'm just looking at it going we can barely keep our our snackies drawers stocked because and and that's not cuz you know people like you know do a bad job or something it's just cuz like we we've got a lot going on and it's easy for it's easy for just in case we need it stuff to Fall by the wayside when
something else is happening right so I I understand especially if you can't even keep snackies in stock which are extremely visible oh yeah you know okay you know you know why the snackies aren't in stock right now I yeah Canada Post strike Costco relies on them for delivery so we don't have snackies right now like I think our I think our shipment is like one of those limbo shipments where it started before the strike ended and then it or before the strike started and then didn't get
completed or something I I I don't know exactly why I'm piecing This Together someone told me that it's to do with the Canada Post strike and I read an article about how some things are stuck in limbo so I made some assumptions I connected some dots but basically it's something to do with the Canada Post strike well we'll call them moldies now instead of Snackies it's just been in a warehouse for the last month and a half thanks Dan um let's see last one I've got here for
you hello gents I think my last merch message went astray yes it did I'm sorry about that I own a ZX Spectrum UK competitor to the Commodore 64 do you think keyboard computers could ever make a comeback love Max um no the keyboard is has become such a personal choice like even and I'm not even talking about the people for whom their keyboard is is their their purest expression of theirself you know um I'm talking about just low profile high profile numpad no numpad uh
positioning of various Keys uh keyboards have become such a personal choice that I I feel like integrating them into a device would be a fundamental error of the greatest magnitude um like even even mobile devices right like they they come with a keyboard but you can absolutely switch it out for a different keyboard a different layout different functionality if you want um I just I I don't I don't see us making a return to this and sure yes okay you could make it modular kind
of like what framework did on the framework 16 but again I look at what an outlier the framework 16 is as a laptop with you know a slim modular keyboard um more modularity is absolutely absolutely not the direction that the industry is going and I wouldn't expect that Trend to reverse anytime soon yeah uh Randall we have no plans for a uh like a formal tool bag at this time nothing's impossible but there's  and I think that's it for the wano it feels bizarre doesn't it to be done wano
I like yeah and then go for lunch I'm going to just what do I do what do I do I like I feel like my day is over and it's time to go home like this is like like like salivation condition response right now yeah I'm ready I'm sleepy I'm ready to go to bed yeah cuz like I was talking to Sammy about this I've had maybe three or four like singleand Friday nights off in 10 years not even exaggerating um so I'm like I just go and like stare at the ceiling all evening yeah cuz I cuz I take took my my
meds too early this morning and I'm wired I told my kids I told my kids that I'm coming home at a reasonable time and they were like why and I was like well why do you lie to us Daddy yeah know I was like oh we're doing W show in the morning they're like why I'm like Luke has to catch a flight and they're like oh I'm like oh okay maybe I guess you guys have plans on Friday nights I I don't blame you I mean I've been absentee dad on Friday nights for your entire lives but
yeah sure I mean uh cool have a UK snack or just leave I don't know yeah I mean our branding is all off now we can't have W show after dark when it isn't dark it's messed up man everything's messed up I didn't even push the button oh yeah oh okay well let's do a special let's do a special shout out for dbrand then who didn't get their uh their their Banner interruptions and actually I can I can show you guys I I saw it on the Forum oh okay well that's the ridge collaborative product hold on let's wait
let's refresh again and find another collaborative product hello oh our Costco snacks came through UPS uh as of yesterday oh did they okay so it's fixed now then I think they've always come through UPS oh well why' someone tell me it was something to do with Canada Post then I don't know blaming you I'm going to go speak to that person okay do I have to load a new page like what what's going on here uh okay hello refresh I thought alt F5 is supposed to do like a full refresh alt function F5 am I am I just
completely derping here Dan uh on what on alt F5 alt F5 is the thing to refresh the page right I think that's like is that Force refresh no I thought it was I thought is it it's just F5 alt shift F5 I don't know what the four Al yeah I thought it was alt is it shift F it's shift F5 good Lord for the force yeah okay I haven't had a reason oh crap I haven't had a reason to force refresh a page in years and years and years sorry doesn't happen very often yeah I don't even know if it works
there's no like indicator that it's actually a force refreshing I don't think it's Force refreshing because it's loading it's loading the exact same thing even if I whether I shift you guys are sure it's not all control is it control I think sometimes there's like a shortcut that you hit the refresh icon while holding it on a shortcut I don't know if that works okay yeah it seems to be just not okay LTD backpack available now I'm just going to keep clicking stuff   launched oh uh Black Friday sale ends in
10 hours shop now I don't oh my God uh I don't care uh okay yeah circuit board so cool um this apparently is gyro controlled on Android which I thought was pretty neat uh if you go to um if you go to the the circuit board landing page um there's three different versions we've got uh dark circuit short circuit and glow circuit and uh it's going pretty good people are pretty into the design so guys you can you can check that out our skin part dbrand there you go all right I think that's pretty much
it we'll see you guys again next week same bad time same bad channel oh oh crap what what you should do is we should pull up a video well no no we got this going to call them I was going to I was freaking out I don't know what's going to happen this is uh this is hilarious for the first little while before I synchronized my contacts on the iPhone uh Luke was still in my address book as slick and so I didn't realize that I went to call him with with voice in my car and I was like call Luke la
year and it's like sorry who I'm like call slick and it goes through I kind of want to put him back in my address book is that hello hey bye bye  go the show Bring  It I have made a terrible mistake I said same bad time it it'll it'll be like the normal time not this time okay
