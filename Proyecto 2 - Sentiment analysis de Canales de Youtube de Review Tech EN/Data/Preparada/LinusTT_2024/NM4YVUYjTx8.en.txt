[Applause] people of the world your setups they're disgusting but have no fear for I the setup doxer can fix it I have the technology bad cable management it's disease and someone's got to cure it that's why lonus became the setup doctor brought to you by eof flow's Delta 3 plus portable power station our first patient will be longtime viewer Ash hi my name is Ash I'm a full-time software developer but I also tutor kids how to make games with scratch and python I also stream like once a week and I I 
Twitch right out of the gate the vibe in here is best described with one word Obsession that is accur the obsessions I can't tell what's stronger Lego Pokemon or pandas even your power brick is held up with Lego was this really the most efficient and effect wow it really holds on yeah like what is the deal with this do you have a packed with Nintendo that you just buy anything they produce uh pretty much but it's also like I'm a retro game collector so it's got to be like got to collect everything right is
that why you go byy Ash instead of Ashley no my parents called me Ashley but my friends call me Ash so it depends like who you are I see I mainly play on the Nintendo switch so my favorite series is Pokémon and Legend of Zelda wi w being my favorite Nintendo please please remaster Wind Waker I designed some of the spines as well and printed them myself so it's it's been it's been really fun all of which is fine and totally makes sense but I guess my question is what was your mood when you
were organizing this chaos I honestly never really considered how important cable management is and ever since moving in like 3 years ago once I have my computer set up was just like out of sight out of mind kind of thing this whole place just has the most intense gamer Den vibe that I think I have ever encountered well the goal was a couple setup really yeah so my boyfriend's on this side I'm on the other side how many members are there of your pod such that you need this many
keyboards okay so this one isn't my obsession this is my partner's and he really doesn't want people touching them two labels I believe it was used for work maybe at the office so uh-huh and one label wasn't enough no my partner is Chapman we've been together for quite a while almost 11 years but over labeling your possessions is hardly a sin the keyboard Community is going to have a field day on this come on get over here and explain yourself okay I'm pretty sure you use the g710 for a while in the
office I know and you've seen the way they crap on me for it this one still works I know it still works but and also experimenting explain yourself it was cheap on clearance okay you're the one who made the power bar holder was that not obvious it is is the Lego of controllers in order to organize this though I feel like we're going to need to clear a little bit of space I think this chair is the first thing that's got to go and oh okay that was so it doesn't damage the wall cuz we're still in a rental
okay I thought that was like a peel from the box and I was going to say you and Andy would be best friends I'll try not to Dent your wall too much or knock over your pandas well you're Ked out you got the foot wrist oh wow it's comfy right yeah I could get used to this it uh rotates clockwise ites I did not mean to crash into there the funniest thing I think about your setup is that on the surface it really doesn't look that bad it's not until you dig deeper and realize there's a whole ass monitor that
isn't connected to anything in here I got that from work when we started working from home permanently and I don't know what to do with it so yep next to the Skelly sorry that guy escaped from the closet and there's more Classics the cable that isn't connected to anything I was using that to charge my phone at some point from what the air yes you were just drawing power from cloud cloud charging Cloud charging Chapman's is kind of okay so why didn't uh why didn't he do yours yeah
CH I mean I didn't know what she wanted and you know this takes a lot of work you didn't know what she wanted so you went with nothing fellas out there That's a classic use it tell me this is there a reason that you're doing the whole two keyboards two mice thing and instead of a KVM the reason why I have the two keyboards is that when I'm working it's mainly the wide Monitor and the keyboard but then I also have like my other monitor connected to my desktop with the other keyboard so that I can be
on Discord YouTube please don't get mad at me boss and then this mouse is just like to so that your Jiggler has something to move or no that's actually the one connected to my work laptop so the one that has a Jiggler yes no no no no no no no no she didn't say that she didn't say that I was making a joke don't fire her can support my hobbies if I don't have a job yeah you do have a lot of them so you draw yes I do a slice of Life Comics I draw like little silly life events I'll probably do one of this
as well so where do you publish these on just on to pass and web Tunes oh my God you also have a huge steam collection no not that huge it's like maybe 100 just 100 yeah you describe a 100 games in Steam the way that someone with an entire shelf devoted to switch games I'm more of a console game than a PC Gamer oh my God there's even more there's DS games all over the Shelf here they're all Pokemon you know they're all the same game right yes exactly it's the same formula for the longest time though
Aro is actually pretty good enough chitchat though it's time to get to work Adam what's the plan cable manage everything don't cry how are we all going to fit and working here just like this barely that's how it's not that that bad on the surface but then like why is this keyboard plugged into the front IO you know like it could just be tucked away here's more cables that are not plugged into anything hey Ash catch them haha ha sorry okay I'm done I won't make that joke again I don't think I've
ever seen something this fuzzy and the fuzziness is not just the fuzziness but also the dust not making it better nope a whole last other pair of headphones here dude there's so many pairs of headphones in this apartment that was actually free I don't know what to do with it sell it yeah Facebook Market Marketplace we'll sign it and that would work yeah we should have picked up on that from the fact that you don't know to sell your old DS games once you've moved on to playing switch
games no man those are those are cool those are DS are actually considered  Now isn't that brutal I love this this is about as Dusty as I expect these to generally be you've got your four keys that you use a lot yes your four keys that you use a bit and then the 12 that you never touch yes so undo new new file save and transform where the hell is this plugged into Adam here why is this oh my God it was plugged into this monitor arm so like credit for labeling your cables yes but uh bad credit for being like
let's plug it in directly across my entire desk so do you stream switch games as well is that why you have a dock here you just collect docks occasionally I would stream like cozy games like easy games to play when I'm not feeling like drawing tell me this how many Nintendo switch docs do you have three I bought one for the office I have the Zelda one so you do collect dogs yes well not really I would like the Animal Crossing one too that one's really cute but what don't you collect
yeah dead bod I love what do you mean what do you mean don't lie you're not supposed to see that one what am I looking at here Pokémon cards my friend got me into collecting the 151 it was really bad that's a bad friend this is pretty clean for the most part did you build your computer I built it last year for my birthday pretty clean don't show the backside oh gross I didn't know those filters existed oh God you can see that why do you have so many VGA cables good question I don't actually
know do you use these Logitech speakers nope this is a universal docking station uh work gave it to me I couldn't figure out how to Fook it up we're going to use it today great this is great dude this has everything you need you had all your peripherals plugged into like little unpowered hubs and stuff I'm amazed that you didn't overload it did you ever plug something into that little dinky Hub and just have it not not work not that I can remember yeah but you also didn't 
shot wow lots of dust bunnies I'm going to go on here and say you probably don't own a cleaning cloth so uh I'm no I'm kidding can I have a cleaning cloth let me think damn cloth let me think if I asked her where a particular Pokemon game though it's boom I'm on it oh thank you uh all right let's uh what was that nothing was the neighbor telling us to keep it down I kind of want to explore the idea of having the secondary monitor here because us kind of drawing more like in the corner which
would allow us to shoot into the corner which would make this space look a little bit nicer and I would love to explore the idea of talking about our sponsor ecoflow not only are we cable managing we're also setting you up with oh God it's heavy a UPS what is it great question it's the ecoflow Delta 3 plus portable power station now you might be asking what's a big old portable battery doing in a home setup upgrade while the ecoflow Delta 3 plus has a sub 10 millisecond switch overtime meaning that
this can act as an uninterruptable power supply protecting your Hardware from Power disruptions and your Hardware will just keep working away thanks to the "1,24 WTH battery inside this thing" should you find you need more stored energy you can use ecof flow's Delta ecosystem and add additional batteries up to 5 KW hours and if you need to supply a high power drw item simply turn on X boost and get up to 2600 wat of output and if the power's out for a long time no worries you can charge this
thing via solar a gas generator or out of the back of your car plugged directly into AC though this will charge in under an hour and it'll do it quietly thanks to their ex quiet Tech but fast charging hurts battery longevity doesn't it thankfully an ecof flows app you can set custom charging limits to make sure that this thing outlasts its 5year warranty the app also sends you remote alerts when the power goes out and will let you know just how much juice is left in your
battery wait I just got a notification says we have to go back to the video but before you do that make sure to check out the ecoflow Delta 3 plus in the link in the video description we'll have to find a spot for that as well first let's wipe down this table this desk had like structural junk on it look how easily it moves I'm just wiping it and it just moves all over the place now you have this monitor arm that the tablet is on that goes nice and low yeah but the question is do you feel that
this is a good location like if you were streaming and you had say like a chat up here and you were drawing here cameras around here yeah no I think this is great and then you could have one keyboard one Mouse here and then work keyboard work Mouse and then we can have your laptop kind of in the background wherever cuz you don't need your laptop no with this extra space you could take this shelf and put it on the table is that going to be safe oh yeah you could use it to display items for the stream
and then also you have more space to walk through here okay yeah is this a closet do you need to get into this um we don't have to get into oh okay sorry what's what's in here now I'm now I'm oh my God oh my God editor blur that I was wondering when you guys are going to open the Clos I was like if they don't open it yeah that's perfectly fine with me sets built or are they in there they're new this is all stuff that's not built yet um we're you trade oh my God this is your
Investment Portfolio I have to diversify I have stocks in games I have stocks in Lego oh okay let's just so you don't need to get in there often let's just un this the situation let's pretend that doesn't exist we're roasting heavier than it looks hold on I need to keep it level one moment please oh yes structural note 9 okay there we go I was using the phone in my pocket to interesting I think we'd want to rethink a little bit the sort of arrangement like random PlayStation
boxes probably don't belong in the background probably not but if we if we kind of rethought the Shelf layout a little bit actually not bad if we go kind of camera like this and tablet like this but tell us now if it sucks and we will move it we will put it back where it was let's stick with it I do like it it's different I can always reorganize what's inside the shelves why don't we have that be an ash task while you're working on maybe I don't know some pandas we'll figure it out Lego Pokémon one of my
many obsessions just hunches something to go in there I'm going to be figuring out Cable Management on to the desk now you already had this APC surge protector thing but have you seen the most magical part of the magnetic Cable Management Solutions lineup no I have not it's really cool so what you do is you take this quarter 20 okay okay which is like a standard threading so you can actually use this threaded insert here to Mount like cameras with these things and all kinds of cool things but what it comes
with by default is this little quarter2 threaded weird geometry thing that is designed to go into these little like Keyhole things so you basically stick it in there okay twist till it's nice and tight and that's it now you have a magnetic power strip but lonus the table isn't really metal but wait there's more we have adhesive and screw in metal plates oh wow okay I can't tell if you're faking it or not I'm trying I can show that in action now I've got the adhesive backs removed on
our little metal plates here so all we got to do is figure out exactly where we want to put this I'm kind of feeling right right about here we place that slide it off and then now I'm going to screw these into the bottom of the table  positioned we're going to get under here and start plugging stuff into our  supply alongside our magnetic Cable Management products we've brought a few products from other companies that are also very Nifty one thing that I really love are these little Runners that hide
the cables and makes them look like they blend into your crown molding like look at that what do you got there nothing nothing nothing oh yeah I just poking the crown molding I was just asking I don't actually see anything yeah see  know it's still a little chaotic but it's starting to come together I feel like we already have so much more space in here yeah it's so clean and I can actually see the table so we have all of your peripherals are now plugged into this wav link it's cleaned up so much
stuff just having this awesome dock right there another product we really like are these kind of zippable cable sleeves they're great for when you want to run a bunch of cables straight down like say the leg or any kind of quick run you can just zip as many of these together as you need you simply kind of grab all the cables you want to go and then you just wrap around your five is a different height than all the rest of the key I know right what the hell it has a cute face on it it looks upsetting
just put one Panda here and called it done here you go all right this one doesn't really match my vibe I need a different Panda do you want one from Calgary Panda me all right Calgary Panda Calgary Zoo yeah Calgary Zoo were they once had pandas yes I love the Calgary Zoo Lower Mainland needs to get their zoo game oh our zoo is terrible it's so bad our zoo is so bad they shouldn't fix it they should just get rid of it and set the animals free in Abbotsford I mean there's already cougars in
Vancouver how dare you talk about my mother that way I'm sorry I was talking about you I am not old enough to be a cougar oh I think you are you're like Prime cougar age excuse yeah cuz cuz you're young enough that like you would still get laid if you went to the bar questionable Lon is take it as a compliment you have game you just don't know it not with that hair wa yeah I was sitting here I was trying to make this all cute like he's looking over the shoulder of the big Panda now I
don't really feel like putting in the work there upside down Panda who gives a anymore forget it okay that kind of works yeah we got we got an issue we're now cleaner on this side than we are on the other side we're not cleaning the other side we offered one cable management upgrade Chapman gets nothing Chapman gets nothing this is only for ash Chapman your side's not looking good step up your game you know he's going to do it it's going to be all like custom Lego you know cable holder or whatever
he still goes there oh yeah he totally goes there or do you want him in the corn do you want him oh yeah it should be there 100% Adam it can't even be like doing something like a hay beautiful yeah sassy little side hip yeah oh my god it works okay so so show me your drawing drawing posture so I guess it would be like over here we definitely are not taking advantage of our super cute backdrop right now okay but don't look over here look look like you would look and be comfortable like you would
ergonomic try to pretend you're comfortable after everything we've gone through today you know what it's not bad but I feel like it could be better there now your monitor's farther away and your camera is where it needs to be so then when we tuck this out of the way it'll just just kind of hang out over there right and where where did this come from one of ours I mean it's got dust on it so where is this dust coming I just wiped this might be coming from youus anything's possible but like
seriously 3 hours ago you watched me wipe this desk what is this I can see why you don't bother it just instantly is Dusty again wait what what did did you just unvi that I just added more of my stuffies it looks cute why are there Lions oh Lions is more Chatman thing pandas are mine wow this looks great let's bring your chair back in yeah sure here we go oh boy oh my God how am I doing I don't know use your eyes all my eyes are looking at the chair you're good you're good you're good okay watch
out on the right okay oh yeah what did where did that come from was that from you no I I I think that was from the chair it just spawns from nowhere here okay that's why they're dust bunnies anyway how's it feel it feels really  do you like it you don't have to Crane your neck as much now anymore yes I don't have to Crane my neck anymore and I think my physiotherapist would be probably pretty happy I have no idea if she ever actually draws on paper but what's kind of cool is there's enough of
the desk actually open over there that you could theoretically you know do or I could just leave my Pokemon cards there the second we leave she's going to go back to cluttering Chapman you're going to hold her accountable though right for what duration of time it can't this can't be infinite just like this infinite segue to our sponsor thanks ecoflow thanks Ash thanks you for watching and uh also if you want to get an upgrade why don't you you just click that link down in the description it's
going to be so much fun it's going to be so awesome you'll get a thing we'll make fun of you yeah we'll roast you and get to roast them back yeah up top  [Laughter]
