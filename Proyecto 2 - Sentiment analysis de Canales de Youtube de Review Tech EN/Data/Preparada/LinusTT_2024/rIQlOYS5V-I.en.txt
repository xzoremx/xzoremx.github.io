Positive Vibes all of y'all happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show what the heck we've got a great show lined up for you guys today the new Apple Mac Mini looks absolutely flipping outstanding to the point where I am starting to wonder if you're a non-gamer is there any other computer that matters I mean you'll be able to play cyberpunk on it soon that's a strong statement I know but I might end up standing behind it depending on how our testing of it goes wow I'm open
to having my opinions changed but right now I'm liking it a lot we're also going to be talking about playing Minecraft with AI That's Right AI company decart decart whatever it doesn't matter the point is they've released a playable AI model that was trained on Minecraft that allows you to play Minecraft without actually playing the game of Minecraft wow no textures no game engine no nothing just AI that sounds like the worst uh well we're going to try it all right we get to try it it's playable in
browser very playable doesn't it play it oh no no you play it oh you'll figure it out he'll figure it out what else we got I fix it figured it out and they have fixed McDonald's they have fixed McDonald's soft serve machine problem so that's good if you want ice cream and good if you care about right for repair for one particular extremely wealthy company um also multiple people did really cool things with Hardware no no no no no no no no no okay well we'll get it okay not
the company thing we'll get to that later it actually matters a lot and we have someone who took I can't find it here did it make it ah yes spotify's car thing is saved  the show is brought to you today by manscaped one password and Squarespace and of course by our chair partner secret lab our laptop partner LG and our rap partner dbrand let's jump right into our headline topic which is of course the Apple Mac Mini with their new M4 processor Apple began the week by announcing a new Mac every day to help
keep the I mean doctor away I guess right like that's got to be the joke is that the joke I hope so I guess so uh they began with the M4 iMac followed finally got a new iMac uh followed by the redesigned Mac Mini and a refreshed lineup of MacBook Pros in addition to the M4 Apple likewise announced the M4 Pro which is available for the Mac Mini and MacBook Pro lineup and the M4 Max sorry not the iMac no the iMac was only M1 last time around if I recall correctly why I'm I'm I'm could be a
little rusty on that but if I recall correctly it was it was only available because I don't know it's just a it's basically a screen with a basic computer in it I think is kind of the idea it's the Facebook surfing machine sure uh people would probably give them a hard time if it did have a high-end processor in it because it would be priced so much for such a basic Facebook browsing machine um all right anyway hold on hold on hold on and the M4 Max okay uh and the M4 Max which is only available in
the MacBook Pros uh Max with an M4 Pro or Max will now have multiple Thunderbolt 5 ports rather than Thunderbolt 4 which I'm extremely excited about we'll talk about in just a moment here and for the first time the newest generation of iMac will have  screens all right the Mac Mini though is the one that I want to talk about because some of the okay notes are we didn't give them much time to work on the notes today um and unfortunately I really need to look at the at the dock here one second
or at my spreadsheet where I added the topic uh M4 here we go uh nope this is a previous week oh boy we're off to a really good start today okay the Mac Mini Luke let's go shopping okay that's what I want to do for this segment all right so I'm going to be a Mac and you're going to be a PC boy so I'm going to go on apple.com I'm just going to pick another country or region sorry hold on I blue screen got him so I'm going to go to the United States and you're going to go on PC part
picker okay here we go I'm going to shop for a Mac and you're going to try to build a PC for the same price as me so for starters here let's uh here we go Mac Mini pre-order let's have a look at the price that you're going to be looking at so we're going to go with the let's go with the starting Mac Mini uh that comes in at $5.99 $600 so Luke why don't you put together a pretty decent machine for $600 it's been a while since Luke has really you know shopped for computer Sho
for a computer because he's gotten them for free since he started here which was like 12 years ago was before then yeah I I believe him I believe in him I believe that he can do it and guys chat feel free to pick in feel free to pitch in and give Luke some ideas for starting points for things like you know CPU if there's any how much are motherb chips he should be looking at motherboard man motherboards have spiked in a big way they kind of ruin this whole thing to be
honest like you used to be able to get a pretty decent board for like 80 90 yeah yeah like Canadian you'd probably be looking at more like 115 120 but now like a decent motherboard you're looking at like more like $10 $140 um unless you're willing to make some compromises there are lower-end chipsets but sometimes they can come with pretty bad compromises um especially if you want a machine that you're going to be able to kind of upgrade for a while add more m.2 storage
and stuff like that so wait how much do I have 600s $600 yeah and and you're on PC part picker I believe that's in Us by default yeah I think so uh yes okay so guys feel free feel free to pitch in I I don't see anyone trying to help you which is a little discouraging get a 4090 sure oh man how much RAM does yours have uh okay yeah yeah yeah so can I know some specs on absolutely this is very exciting for the first time uh I think ever Apple has finally acknowledged that the year is
now 2020 plus and they no longer are offering a base model machine with only 8 gigs of RAM they have 16 gigs of ram in that base model so Luke why don't you go ahead and find yourself a 16 gig what are you doing no don't just don't don't don't do that build a computer jeez okay  ram smaller too power button in the right place s sorry memory um 16 gigs yeah you need 16 gigs of RAM to match the base model new Mac Mini see p are a little bit too based which is part of the problem cuz they automatically
assume you want two * 60 uh yeah you've got filters you got filters you you don't need that you just need even more RAM yeah I suppose so the problem with this whole contest is that we are lowering ourselves oh my goodness okay but we're not actually competing just configure a computer for cry out loud are you a politician you're too good at this this guy uh how much storage do you have uh okay that's where things do fall apart a little bit assuming tab I only get 256 gigs of storage can I even select
that I only get 256 gigs of storage and that is a pretty frustrating thing that remains still about Apple's lineup is how much they charge for really small amounts of storage and what's especially frustrating about it for me is I know that a big part of why they're charging so much for it is that The Sweet Spot for price to capacity has moved past 256 gigs so they're charging so much for it because it's just a terrible value on a component level to build such a tiny SSD
these days The Sweet Spot for capacity is probably more like in the one terabyte range now with that said I'm trying to think like how many dies would be on on a one tbte drive now is it is it one or two for the most part think it would be two I I haven't looked that closely at them in the last probably year so apparently you can do them with one yeah so that sweet spot is definitely more like in that one terab range um so you are you're basically just like wasting silicon to make 256 gig
storage um so that's that's going to that's going to kind of impede Luke because he's not going to get a great deal on his SSD yeah it was 18 bucks whereas if I start oh okay that's pretty not that bad still pretty good actually so it looks like there's a really broad Sweet Spot these days then because you'll probably pay oh yeah no no yeah no that's yeah that's a bad deal because the thing is you there's there's a certain amount of cost that is just in the cost of making anything at all and
shipping it and QA it and developing it um so there's only so cheap that you can make something that's why that's why you can buy a hard drive like a modern hard drive for $250 and you can't buy one that is 12th the capacity for $12 because you just you still have to put a motor in it you still have to ship it around the world you still have to pay someone to assembly assemble it like there's there there's just fixed costs that are associated with bringing a product to Market at all um okay sorry
we're back on Luke's laptop what do you got what do you got do do I need to uh buy an operating system well I mean the Mac comes with one that's what I thought you were gonna say well but with that said with that said we have a video coming in a little while about how Windows doesn't necessarily uh you can it can be obtained for a lot less than $120 so why don't you leave you know what I'm nothing if not uh gracious and benevolent kind uh yeah so leave out the operating system this is where I'm at
currently take the operating system out okay so we're going to Luke laptop okay what do you what do you got what do you got walk us through it ryzen 57600 X which is the first thing I chose so I didn't really Speck it in too much um one of the cheapest motherboards I could find ended up being m x 16 GS of acceptable Ram um a SSD that you shouldn't buy to be completely honest but it fits the storage thing of of your side um a relatively cheap matx case y but like attractive but it's all right
it's not bad you're going up against Apple you're going to have to have a reasonably you know decent looking like so I I I didn't go for just a piece of junk um and I found one of the cheapest 600 W power supplies I could find which is Overkill wattage wise but I didn't really want to get like something something that Lucas would warn you is going to blow up yeah this one was decently rated um sort of okay I don't know sure okay um and I've got a little bit more money to play with yeah you've got some more
money to spend um with that said you might have some you might have some things to kind of deal with here do you have Wi-Fi cuz I do yeah I think so are you sure I think this board has it actually oh I'd be pretty surprised at that price point nope okay so you're you're probably gonna need some Wi-Fi why don't you go get some Wi-Fi get Wi-Fi wi okay cool I also need a cooler uh no no that should come with a cooler are you sure yeah you should be good to go it looks like the slim box oh shoot
oh that's a 7600 yeah yeah you're going to need a cooler yep you'll need a cooler you'll need a cooler you'll need some Wi-Fi I might have some other things to inform you that you're going to need but why don't you go ahead and add those first and see how it goes for you do I just get a cooler that I know won't fit in this case at all and just not worry about it oh no no I think you're probably going to need a cooler that fits in your case smart guy why I could get something huge and it would be
cool yeah you could just hot rod it you know it stick out the side of the case I I won't get something way too big but I also just like don't actually know what would fit in here um I don't know maybe you guys can maybe you guys can help him maybe you guys can help him a little bit like a low profile am5 uh oh $55 for noctua cooler yeah I don't think we're going to be doing that uh I think PC part picker has clearance assume that this fits sure you know what it's not mad at me good enough okay go find go
find a Wi-Fi card or do I just upgrade the motherboard you could upgrade to a motherboard with onboard Wi-Fi yeah totally 100 bucks let's see if I Bonk that out what I can get he bonked it uh you can filter by having Wi-Fi I think this is only like 20 something dollars more uh is there a Wi-Fi thing probably I would think so they've got pretty good pretty good filters onboard ethernet Onboard video I believe hey look at that oh um yeah you're going to need like pretty good Wi-Fi by the way your Wi-Fi 7 or
what uh I'm just going to check real quick but I think so it's either that or 60 you know what I I'll I'll allow 60 but I'm I'm going to double I'm going to double check what kind of uh what kind of Wi-Fi I have H I mean Apple has its own issues with shopping it doesn't even freaking say 60 apparently 60 okay there you go okay so you can have Wi-Fi 60 okay okay what are you at how you doing for pricing saves me $10 $560 wow PC is $40 ahead uh you're going to need Thunderbolt
oh can I sort by that I don't this thing has I'll tell you I'll allow I'll allow no Thunderbolt I'll allow no Thunderbolt uh but you will that what you will need is some USBC ports you got any USBC ports I think so does the case have any  picture yep you've got USBC at least one you've got at least one does your motherboard support it does it have a   man what do you got what do you got Luke  oh yeah USB 3.2 gen one headers let's go yeah you got it you got it if that's uh
if that's Su specs for the board there wait you have an ITX board uh yeah and now we have an matx case you're making me change things on the fly my guy look I'm just I'm trying to I'm just trying to help the ram still fits everything's still technically work I'm just trying  CPU uh I didn't actually say a word I just made a sound if if it's got to have Thunderbolt then it needs to be right um no no he gave me a pass on that one and USB 4 is in some ways functionally the 
graphic shut up so uh okay where where's your 10 core CPU at hold on is there a core count yeah there we go oh wait no other way around yeah technically every word is just a sound so hey well we don't need to get into technicalities over here okay so here we go see I actually can't cuz I can only get better than that unfortunately also not all cores are made the same uh your cores are going to need to be pretty good h i mean we don't need to we don't need to get into that also you're going to need a pretty 
GPU okay why don't you throw just for the sake of argument why don't you throw like a a 3050 why don't you throw a 3050 in there that's what you saying is a pretty good GPU well it's on board it's you're going to need you're going to need what would be an extremely good onboard GPU uh California 909 says 10 core arm isn't the same as 10 core x86 California 909 needs to get caught up on some tech tips because arm versus x86 is not the whole story um it's it's it's down to
the actual design of the cores and uh no that is not the case do we have to do the 10 core thing cuz there's actually just like not very many of those tell you what tell you what as long as you have a really solid 8 core CPU I'll allow it okay current gen yeah yeah you're not going to be "able to use a 7,000 series wa no that's" not current uh now that he's working on Labs he's  show oh man this was great wait so isn't that the processor that I had no you had "a 7,000 series you're going to need"
"9,000 Series my" guy oh but no one actually likes those I mean it doesn't matter you're going to need a you're they're not very good they're they're fast and efficient I mean I'm going to draw way less power "than you even 9,000 fine as long as you" got eight cores all yeah I genuinely think that processor was fine all right how you doing over there good gravy goodness gracious the GPU is really the problem I mean the whole thing is really the problem now I'm now it's my do have integrated Graphics now
it's my turn to shop uh yeah but like not good enough they don't compare check this out for $600 I'm getting a 10 core CPU whatever 10 core GPU means but their their onboard GPU on M4 is quite quite nice 16 gig what what if you make that storage a respectable amount well we'll get to that what happens to the competition then H we'll get to that in a minute first up I'm getting 16 gigs of unified memory and 256 gigs of SSD storage which honestly speaking I actually don't mind
as much as them nerfing the Ram oh because as someone who's going to use a Nas anyway and who doesn't need storage on my PC honestly we tried to roll out sorry to cut you off but we we tried to roll out some new standardized laptops Dan Dan will know about this too uh to the business team and we got we got viciously screamed and yelled at by your employees because of not having enough RAM no they were fine um but 16 gigs of RAM they didn't like it really yeah who sorry what team capping out too many
tabs to many tabs so many Chrome tabs too many tabs hilarious we've been through two or three laptops for some people because they have so many tabs that they just explodes okay interesting yeah all right so let's go let's go back to my to configure your RAM up and your and your storage up uh well yeah but you only have 16 gigs of RAM so that would affect your budget too hold on we'll get to it I suspect yours will go up more the point is I don't mind the SSD that much because I'm I'm using a Nas for
storage anyway all right I got three Thunderbolt 4 ports I have an HDMI port um couple USBC ports in addition to my thunder bolt ports headphone jack okay uh hold on hold on we're going to get we're going to get to Ram we're going to get to ram in a second those are expensive I don't want to talk about this first of all for my for my Nas I uh you know I'm going to need 10 gig and I don't really need Final Cut Pro or logic pro that's fair the point is at the starting at the base
configuration this good enough for most people is an absolutely killer machine is the only thing that I think that I would recommend for like Grand papy oh yeah needs a needs a computer ma Min have been killer for a long time and this is honestly a very good jump dude there's definitely going to be some stuff for us to talk about in the review like the fact that they put the power button on the bottom it's like why how often are you turning off your computer why yeah but who cares why it's like
Aesthetics athetics you know they redesigned the mouse again and they put the charger on the bottom again is there an Apple logo on the top of it again they put the charger on the bottom I'm not surprised again is there an Apple logo on the top of the Mac Mini like it's just uh oh here we can see the whole Gallery right right they should just made that the power button look and it should glow it should glow like the old MacBook why not sure where am I going to put my coffee then oh my
goodness anyway the point is the point is that um I don't like that this thing is absolutely killer until the second you want to upgrade it so this is where things do get a little bit more complicated you can see that the $800 configuration changes only that you get 256 gigs of storage trash um so for context let's just fire up the old newegg.com what would 256 gigs actually you know what no let's see what 2 terab of uh of storage would cost me over on new egg. LOM which is
like got to be basically I wouldn't say a minimum but like pretty normal these days for $154 and that's a nice WD black drive like there's a cheaper Samsung one right below it and even that is a ni One is even cheaper brand name Drive yeah um that is a 990 Evo that is a that is a really nice I'm fairly certain uh for 2 terab you can get under 100 bucks that's a nice SSD um so apple is literally charging an order of magnitude more than commodity SSD pricing for a storage upgrade speaking of which oh shoot I
forgot to have this added to the dock but someone someone like hacked together um Apple SSD upgrade harness or something uh oh no I can't find it I can't find it uh if someone can find it send it to me uh but someone made a way to upgrade the ssds in in Max uh like some Hardware Hardware hacker um and then things don't get much better a mere 8 gigs of memory okay so that appears to be the only upgrade going from the $800 configuration to the "$1,000 configuration I get eight more"
gigs of RAM that will cost me another $200 so go going to for context for context here's 32  ddr5 sorry sorry for context here's 64  ddr5 whoopsy Doodles for $200 so Go Go app just can't resist Luke we don't need to do 64 gigs let's let's not let's not can't resist but let's go to 32 gigs on the apple configurator and a 2 terb SSD and how much does that cost all right all right let me start with my base let me start with my base configuration so the business team would not accept you're going to accept 16
gigs and a 2 terab SSD and I think 2 terab SSD is fair just as a reminder guys just as a reminder oh my God we just spent okay on New Egg for 64 gigs of memory and a 2 terab  we went from a $600 machine buying half as much memory half as much memory and the same and actually Less storage slightly less storage cuz we had the 256 gig to start we went from a $600 machine   computer that's how they get you that's a rip that's a rip right there that's how they get you Apple gives you the
first hit for cheap now I can just like get whatever I want yeah yeah you can have whatever you like um yeah so I think that our review of the M4 Mac Mini is going to be a little bit complicated because as a basic machine that kind of does 98% of what any non-gamer so we're talking non-gamers it'll probably do 98% of what 90 plus% of people would need and it'll do it for a long time Apple supports their products with software for a very long time and that used to be a major strength for the PC platform but
I feel like it's actually been a little less things have been a little bumpy with trusted platform modules um with vulnerabilities that are only getting patched back a couple of generations um you've got so you've got to give credit to Apple for the things that they do well at that entry level price this thing absolutely slaps but as soon as you start tweaking anything Luke's sitting over here "building an $1,800 computer right now I" guess having fun is that what you're
working on okay well let's see let's see let's see how you're doing over here I upgraded to a 7800 x3d I upgraded to a uh 4070 yeah I haven't changed the like the SSD or the ram yet but that honestly won't price much okay I think I think you owe Apple a motherboard with like some USB 4 ports or something Fair do that if we're going to be if we're going to be somewhat fair to Apple here yeah I I barely even really started yeah people want to see like a 4070 or something like that like let's outperform this
thing it was a 4070 oh did you no yeah that was a 4070 in there ni um motherboard shopping oh boy yeah it's fine just use filters you got this he's got this not to mention that you're going to have all the PC like DIY PC benefits of you know PCI Express slots that you can expand and if you go am5 in particular which AMD has committed to support until I believe it's 2027 uh you may oh sorry I had something in my eye there uh you may see future upgrades to the CPU that Luke has chosen for example
um that might offer um measurable performance improvements potentially allegedly um what you got there you find I still need Thunderbolt right no no no as long as you got USB 4 and you got decent number of USBC ports board is actually pretty legit then for in regards to Features okay all right cool uh cool what else you got you got probably get it a better cooler you could probably get more RAM if you wanted what are you even at for your price these out 1360  $1350 Wow Let's Get yeah 32 gigs of RAM
why not that seems pretty good all right it's less than 100 bucks by the way well I think we've made our point on this topic we can move on I got a 4 tab drive  I'm still under your budget you got to rub it in like that hey all right I see how it is I could yeah I could get a sick knock to it cooler as well still be under Bud yeah well your computer's like huge so the Mac Mini is mini so get wrecked yeah get wrecked get wck I win I declare victory for team Apple I unapologetically declare Victory all
right what do you want to talk about next uh Let's do plory let's do some of these modder things this was a really cool week for for modifications do you want to do the car thing or do you want to do the uh steam deck framework yes all right steam deck framework I I wasn't answering your question okay whatever you pick what you like picked one okay the Beth deck yeah this thing is really cool do you want to go for it no no mod Beth Lee Lei Lee I'm going to go with Lee uh has designed her own
gaming handheld built around a framework 13 laptop main board if she worked on textiles instead of Technology she could  bethle hem wow wow okay all right uh you're not going to ding him all right there we go sorry I'm still in shock yeah that that was intense yeah uh anyways it's called the best I'm trying to show a picture but um we talked about this a little bit on the pre-show dude it's so bad how impossible it is to use the internet now okay it looks so cool oh my goodness any anyways
uh they posted 3D print files for the handheld case to printables and designed it as a part of an ongoing competition on the site to make a cool framework mainboard case included with the files is a list of necessary Parts in the description what no way that's awesome uh like screws and an 8 in 900p touchscreen all the listed Parts apparently cost around 200 bucks before shipping but that doesn't include the framework mainboard the framework battery Ram SSD or a Wi-Fi card those a
l up you can get all that from framework the Beth deck is entirely solderless except for the listed speakers uh but they don't actually recommend them because they they sound like um I pressed the button I did the thing I was a good boy um uh and are too powerful for the small handheld they claimed that the whole thing can be assembled in about 15 minutes and disassembled in less than 2 minutes or zero if you try hard enough uh there are some issues with the design aside from the speaker the left joystick
is a little bit sticky apparently the battery can overheat and the power button flies off and out the window during disassembly due to these quirks and the Design's popularity uh they're releasing a 1.5 version on November 8th to fix the smaller problems Beth is also designing a thinner and lighter 2.0 version which will apparently feature a custom PCB for the controls and better speakers wow dude this is so sick it looks actually like really cool investment disclosure I'm invested in framework um this is
amazing someone said try this for a short circuit video that' actually be kind of sick I don't know if that's a short circuit video but I well they said it's you make it in 20 minutes h i mean the whole thing can be assembled in 15 minutes and it's solderless I guess theoretically that's a lot of prep for a short circuit video though that is true sourcing everything and all that so no promises that it would be short circuit but I I I feel like I'd be kind of down to try it could
be fun on an LTT I don't know the value proposition maybe not amazing not going to be great but that's also potentially true for Frameworks yeah no no no yeah no I'm I'm not hard for the course with highly repairable things sometimes I think it's really awesome I think it's super cool great work Beth keep it going I love that they're like making a second revision and stuff yeah like this is more interesting to me than than just a a steam deck I don't know seems cool I mean to be clear there's
still great things about the steam deck Steam OS oh yeah freaking awesome this obviously doesn't have track pads um uh the the audio is tuned really well in the steam deck it uses uh especi the new OLED one uses a beautiful OLED display with HDR like let's be very clear this is not the thing to buy if you just want a smooth seamless portable gaming experience but say you're in the framework ecosystem upgrading your laptop sure this is a pretty legit thing to do with your old motherboard that's
so sick compared to what most old laptops get used for yeah like yep either nothing or or a very small un uncool task dude the number of like Tech upgrade videos that we've done or off-site shoots that we've done in people's homes B basically um where their old Tech is just I banded in a in a bag somewhere or behind a shelf somewhere or whatever turn it into an handheld gaming machine what if you could take it with you on the go so sick very cool do we want to talk about the
other one sure yeah let's do that it's near the bottom of the dock I think yeah it's it's right above the sponsors spotify's car thing has I I would say I watched this whole video is actually really good um I would say it's it's straight up saved it says uh is saved question mark on the talk but like no this is actually amazing uh YouTuber damit Jeff released a video this week discussing custom firmware for spotify's car thing a $90 device uh the music streaming company will be remotely
bricking in two months by the way that that's really stupid yeah not cool so before then there's desk thing a firware that has its own companion app for your PC and that also has an app store for your car thing that is so cool there's glance thing which in addition is is still controlling Spotify playback it allows you to add shortcuts to launch apps on your PC similar to something like a uh a stream deck that's super cool um and then there's nocturn which isn't officially out yet and is the only
firmware that managed to get the car thing's original features working which is pretty cool uh for now it requires a host device for networking capabilities um and and whatnot there's also other things you can do with it as well apparently modders have determined car thing will still be audible after the brick date as well which is cool um and honestly I would really just highly recommend watching the video it's actually just really cool what they've done with it um uh Jeff or or Dam it
Jeff also goes over as you can see yeah really cool ways to mount it and like 3D printed little things like he has two different um ways that you can just mount it so it sits on your desk and then there's that one where it's it's actually magnetically held there that is so cool so it's held under his monitor but you can just pull it off and move it somewhere else really cool um I think it's magnetically held at least but yeah really awesome come on darn it very cool video the preview doesn't show you see
if I click a preview my expectation is that it will take me to a frame that shows that yeah anyway the point is you guys should watch the video anyway don't look at don't don't look at us looking at the video look at the video for yourself fantastic video really cool project I thought it was so cool that I was like hey maybe I actually want one of these things and then you went on eBay yeah and found out that uh they're like over twice as much as they originally were what like our notes are
like $90 device cuz it was it was a $90 device it is no longer a $90 device like a $300 device Spotify had no idea what they had what the heck D they didn't know what they had damn it Jeff oh man the his username could not be more perfect yeah yeah this is why we can't have nice broken things Jeff you're fixed in CPUs and motherboards he's fixed in car things typical Jeffs it's all ruined way to go Jeffs as a group I just I don't condone you I can't condone you Dam it
Jeff but yeah super super cool I all the Jeff's in chat apologizing you should literally mid video I paused it opened up eBay and was like car thing and I opened up eBay Canada and looked up car thing and I was like oh they're just trying to scam people that don't know I'll go to the American one and it was just worse I was like what yep oh man oh well any who it's time for us to explain merch messages um yeah we don't do Super Chat we don't do twitch bits we do merch messages through because of a
combination of features on other platforms not actually working correctly and also we just think it's playing better if you want to interact with the show hey why not throw money at your screen and you know maybe uh producer Dan replies to you in the bottom here or just post your message if you have a shout out or maybe he forwards it to someone internally to get back to you what I kill Got Hand all right I don't I don't know oh or maybe he curates it and Luke and I respond no matter what does or doesn't
happen to your merch message you will at least get your order in the mail we've got all kinds of great stuff on LTT store.com including an exciting new product launch that's right my friends it's here the one no not that the one  when show corkboard wow does it come with the pins no oh you have to get your home pins oh but we've had lots of pins I I asked the team I was like do we have any new pins to announce with it and they were like nope and I was like oh you could Mount Your pins
there that's cool are are you are you for real right now I mean I don't have corkboards or or am I a pin collector so I didn't really put it together but I didn't put together putting the LD store pins you are for real right no no no look look look look in the on the store they don't use it that way I mean yeah I guess I mean you could scroll down a little do they end up using that way no no no there's no there's no examples of this wait shut up no keep scrolling are there not more pictures that's all this
is the last one that's it we didn't put any LTT pins on it in the pictures no oh  well we've definitely done pin collections in the past it's also not in the related products the inspiration for doing this was definitely for people to be able to put their LT pins on them well maybe we can put a picture of that somewhere cuz I I looked at I looked at uh this picture and I was like oh yeah that's neat it's not included this is how I've used these types of things in the past but I didn't think about it
being like a a collection thing I forgot we glove forame a Thanos glove for LT scorpions o anyway nothing shows I'll read the thing I'll read the thing nothing shows your passion for Tech more than a snazzy new corkboard that lets people know you watch two big nerds talk about it for hours every week it comes with six push pins which are already inserted into the side and it is super easy to hang on your wall thanks to its two Keyhole slots on the back which conveniently we have put uh magnetic
Cable Management power bar holders into uh because they will definitely work for that but anyway two little Keyhole slots you can just throw a couple nails or screws in the wall or you can use these and you can magnetically mount it which would be super cool uh what else we got to talk it's one power bar key is already attached available now at lm. g/c corkboard we've got a couple of other announcements uh flow plane November update we have a packed November for our float plane members for
starters we'll be dropping a new why is wan Late episode next Friday it's a monthly behind the scenes of lonus and Luke's time after 4:30 p.m. every Friday uh we will also have a new person week airing mid late month it's going to be Elijah week don't expect any backflips though I have personally forbiden it it is for baed finally we're asking our subscribers to send in questions for Anon Q&amp;A this says please click they should just doing Aon week here this is such a terrible
picture of yon um hi floaties we're planning on shooting an Ivon Q&amp;A leave your questions below they may get answered good Lord that is a lot of questions um it's been amazing remember we talked about that concept Luke of having like a like a hater wall posting like comments about how float plane will never work and will always fail and whatever else um and like using it as inspiration for you know yeah flow play is definitely a thing it's actually a it's a great Community the the comments and the
interaction under the videos is like super positive most of the time um I mean anytime people are passionate about things sometimes things can get a little bit heated but it's it's a great in general it's pretty good though it's a great Community um and we've got a great month coming up for you guys and uh all you got to do is go to lm. g/f floatplane to get subscribed and you can submit questions for Sammy to go through and select uh what else we got oh okay the last announcement before we do a
couple of merch messages is our exp partner anchor is once again just oh wait sorry this post was deleted uh oh okay well why' they delete it that's weird I don't know apparently hold on someone says no it doesn't list me there so maybe they finally removed it  yeah what I don't think it was in this  thing I'm going I'm going it was here that night used to be okay probably got deleted cuz they updated it maybe we're clear then okay well well anyway okay good well that's
good then uh all right why don't we do a couple merch messages sure hit me hey guys lus have you seen the trailers for Clare obscure Expedition 33 what now as a fellow turn-based jrpg fan I'd love to hear your thoughts I'm super excited for it Claire obscure Expedition that's not even that's not on my radar at all yet what is this I don't know it's coming in next  who uh interesting multiplatform release  cast reveal trailer I mean it definitely has a Vibe so far but no this is this is the first
that I'm hearing of it so uh this might have to be something that I'll I'll have to throw on my list reactive turn-based combat Dodge Parry en counter okay I mean that doesn't necessarily like mean that it's bad I mean Super Mario RPG has kind the reason why I reacted that way when people say what the combat is and they don't show it I always get suspicious I mean it seems like it's pretty early it's made by sandfall interactive sandfall what are they known for publisher Kepler
interactive I have no idea sandfall interactive uh games list what have you guys done before uh I think this might be the first one oh good luck everyone  Ubisoft uh CEO comes from Ubisoft this is an Ubisoft Splinter company oh okay as in as in uh people from Ubisoft left and made this not not it is an Ubisoft company well hopefully they're the the good people from Ubisoft cuz they had to have gone somewhere my way too short video that I made was about how this is happening a lot now yeah uh so and I
mean there is obviously a period of pain right now in the games industry oh yeah but what I hope is that projects like this totally companies like this are wildly successful and we see kind of a the growth that comes after the volcano you know um and and to be clear the people that are that are suffering in the layoffs and the and the upheaval it it's not fun for anyone it's it's it's terrible but if there was a good outcome that could happen stuff like this and and and the success of stuff
like this would be it yeah I I recognize the the CEO's name um so I'm trying to look up what they've done um and my Google fu is failing right now but I I recognize the CEO's name um and yeah I mean I hope it does well I am I am hoping for basically any of these companies where people split off from one of these big developers that are failing pretty hard right now and they try to make something themselves I have I have big hopes for all of them so I hope this one works out as well
yeah all right one more hit me Dan sure third time buyer first time messenger did you see Jeff gearing's video on the LTT prision screwdriver and how well did you enjoy it uh I did see his video um watch it I watched pieces of it uh like I watched the sections that I thought were most relevant I didn't watch like the fidget spinner bit um Fair seemed pretty long um I think he's just having fun with it but yeah I agree I think that um how do I put this I think that it's ultimately up to
every individual user what features of a product benefit them the most um I didn't really fully understand some of the uh preferences like as as someone who has worked on small electronics a fair bit over the years be they um laptops or phones or game consoles or controllers or whatever the case may be um you know I don't see a clear benefit to having a longer uh hex portion of the bit uh whereas I do see a very clear benefit to having a longer blade portion of a bit um because it happens so often
that um plastic housings will be will will leave a screw deeply recessed and having a longer having a longer blade uh for me means I'll be reaching for the dedicated Precision fixed drivers a lot less often than um than I otherwise would have to um I was a little confused   hm well he he compared it against their plastic one when they have a metal one right yeah that was the main thing that stood out to me I don't uh yeah yes um and their metal one doesn't have the the bit storage so I I think he might
have gone from a feature standpoint so he went bit storage against bit storage instead of metal driver metal premium driver versus Metal premium driver I I don't know um something that you know like to me as someone who has used a Precision screwdriver a lot something that would have been apparent to me very um immediately about our driver is the superior magnetic strength compared to other precision drivers it's one of those little things that we don't cheap out on that um or I shouldn't even
say don't cheap out on because having a magnet at all means you didn't cheap out on the design in my opinion um but that we we spent extra time and we spent extra money to to ensure that it was a really good experience um it's one of those things that we do that should be again um pretty immediately apparent but uh didn't really seem to draw much attention so I don't know I mean look the reality of it is obviously I think our product is great or I never would have green lit the release of it
so you can't really take my opinion um and as I always say um you know you should get multiple uh you should get you should take multiple opinions anytime you're looking to buy a product so whether it's reviews on our site or whe it's you know other creators that we sent Creator editions out to you know all we ask for is the possibility that they will maybe consider talking about it um with their own authentic voice and their own honest opinions um and so yeah you know that
what that means is that every once in a while we're going to send out a driver and someone's going to like it a lot and every once in a while we're going to send out a driver and someone's not going to like it that much and um and you know that's that's uh that's how it works so as far as my understanding goes the the cheaper one that has bit storage the cap doesn't spin so you don't have that Palm turn uh I think it spins a little but not much like not not well I haven't used it
directly so I don't know yeah yeah I  interesting all right what are we doing next the comments on that video are are pretty I have no comment on the comments h um have you read the comments us judges are using algorithmic tools just kind of whenever they feel like it original article here is from The Verge and both it and actually speaking of comments uh the comment section on that video excuse me on that article are worth having a look at because there's kind of an interesting debate and what
side of the debate you land on I guess you know can be up to you to kind of see how you feel about it but I think it's really worth a read um Dan if you don't mind throwing the link to The Verge article into the uh into the various chats I'd appreciate that very much thank you thank you thank you but here's kind of the here's kind of the gist of it um an an always Tim strapped court system in the US is increasingly turning to risk assessment algorithms as a way of guiding a judge's decision for
whether to Grant bail so a bayth a bayth inputs the file information and then the algorithm checks a vast database of past cases and assigns a score low medium or high uh or a number on a scale and um this this system basically is supposed to algorithmically suggest what the risk of reoffence might be um these systems are intended to reduce the impact of personal bias from a judge but there's a lot of questions about how well that's actually working a recent study published in social
problems found that judges report accepting or refusing the advice of these algorithmic tools selectively for their own human potentially biased reasons judges reported using these tools to quickly process lower Stakes cases even when they weren't confident in the output that was provided so basically it's a it's an algorithmic armor you know it's like a it's a shield against making a bad judgment call by just kind of going oh well the algorithm said imagine your algorithmic armor had LT pins on it
however they also ac they also admitted that they were leery of accepting low scores in cases of domestic violence for example or other more intimate crimes due to not trusting the weighing of the algorithm and also due to concern over their own reputations to be clear I 100% agree that in a case of an intimate crime or domestic violence they should be airing on the side of high risk of reoffence not necessarily because the risk of reoffence is necessarily higher but because the
stakes are so high if the risk of re offense for shoplifting a pack of gum is high that I don't I don't care whereas if the risk of re offense of you know assault with a deadly weapon against your spouse is low vehicular man's I'll take a I'll take a 99% risk of re offense for the gum over a 3% risk of reoffence for spousal assault you know like I get it I just mean you don't get to selectively decide if the algorithm works or not based on your own feeling in the moment because that's basically
just your own feeling in the moment with extra step mhm um the judges reported using the apparent authority of these systems to defend unpopular decisions as well all in all the judges were using their own moral views as a ruler to determine whether or not the algorithm was legitimate and would shift how they felt about it from case  case um other Studies have raised questions about how accurate this system is at predicting whether a given prisoner will defend because they have
found garbage in garbage out problems where biased training data would cause certain demographics to be rated as more likely to reoffend even when the individual in question doesn't have a significant past criminal history the demographics are included in theory no but the problem with any algorithmic system um AI included is that if you tell it hey you can't factor in race for example it will find foxies like location the area you live or your income  yeah so dystopia
yeah dyst stopi orcy that's going to be but hey pay as much taxes because the you won't have to pay the judges for as many hours yeah I guess um until they just press that button and then sit in the office and Jud dread it is super amazing how F how easily dismantled the whole taxes or theft um argument is oh boy and how and how quickly how quickly people change their tune if uh if the public resources available to them that they need are not there because they didn't pay for them oh luk car taxi is
here if you want to get going all right with that said I am 100% angry as everyone should be about the way my tax dollars are wasted they are not efficiently used oh yeah oh yeah but weather taxes as a concept dude should exist it's like well yeah but the problem is corruption I I told you the whole uh was it invasive deer I think it was on that one Island have I told you this story The invasive deer sorry what now let me try to find this up look this up hold on invasive deer BC Island helicopter
sniper oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you told me about this okay all right uh tax dollars are spent extremely well there are there are no problems with tax dollars tax dollars are fine we need to get rid of some invasive deer that the hunters would really really like to go after to the point where they would pay you to take these deer out so why don't we spend over 34 of million dollar let's get some Americans to come up over the Border bring a helicopter and go hunting with
sniper rifles in the air to take out 84 deer and let's spend almost a million dollars on it let's go trig says that's "only $10,000 a deer" Luke is it like the uh emu war in the in the Australia that was a little bit more real they deployed the army that was and still lost yeah yeah this is this is 84 deer dude that that that Hunters used to just hunt for them please and it was fine don't bring this up again it makes me irrationally you could gain tax dollars instead you spent
them ah as someone who pays a lot of taxes I promise you that this makes me far more Angry than my currently calm composed demeanor would suggest it's so in I can't like it's it it actually hurts my yeah look look hold on sorry the cost of the first phase which includes the helicopter and Marksman from the US and New Zealand for some reason is about "$834,000 it's about that much and that's" only the first phase the eradication is part of a nearly $6 million multi-year
project to restore the land okay that's cool sick meanwhile do you know what's going on in Siri schools no oh instead of having a fixed school day like you know 8:30 to 3:00 p.m. or whatever I've heard about this they have staggered school days so some students and therefore teachers start earlier and end earlier and some start later and end later vastly extending the potential school day making after school care and after school um like activity planning for parents a f nightmare uh not to
mention inconveniencing teachers who what if you're on the high school basketball team any the school that you're playing against does late hours and your school does early hours it's it's student by student oh yeah so you might um and this is because we don't have enough capacity it's it's a whole it's a whole thing yeah basically I don't have to explain this people in the chat are picking up what I'm throwing down pretty quick here it's a nightmare but thank the maker we got rid of those
deer and to be clear uh this is Parks Canada this is federal this is provincial and Municipal it's not it's not actually necessarily the same the the same coffers that were robbed to go on a little shooting Expedition you got to you got to assume that you know like someone was buddies with someone to get the assignment to go people do you know how much people would pay to go helicopter deer hunting oh yeah like oh yeah dude oh yeah you could turn this into a tourist attraction into a huge event the the the
number of millions of dollars of Tourism dollars that you could generate for the province by just making this a tourist attraction over the next few years you're spending $6 million are you kidding me just tell just tell the hunters of North America cuz I'm sure people would travel for this hey we'll give you a 100 bucks a deer and you don't have to pay us anything dude no you know why they shouldn't do that problem entirely oh you know why they're not supposed to do thats snake rats yeah
yeah you know that whole thing but if you only gave a license to the parks like only people who can kill these deer are sanctioned by us and all of them have to be accounted for maybe that maybe that would be fine but if you pay per head then yeah no um Viper head argument let me see if I can find this I haven't heard of this we're about to get a lesson I also know it is rats I think it's I I've heard this story a bunch of times I don't know if any of them are actually like might be snakes I don't
know what is the original I don't remember exactly oh yeah Viper has snakes yeah I think the snakes was the original one yeah uh I don't know either either way Cobra heads that's it not viers yeah Cobra heads Indian cobra head problem so the the government wanted to get rid of or the local government or whatever wanted to get I might say this slightly wrong I'm sorry uh they wanted to get rid of cobras okay so they were like okay well we'll put a bounty on COBRA heads yeah so if people find a
cobra and they kill the Cobra they can hand in the Cobra head and they make  jail Cobra Cobra okay I got you uh that was pretty good um but they they people just started breeding cobras so they could Farm Cobra heads got it and then you always forget the you don't forget the end bit okay so "apparently last year locals called 2,000" deer at no cost and apparently 25% of the 84 deer that were called were actually local non-invasive deer oh great probably because they were up in a helicopter
yeah trying to identify a particular species of deer  I it actually causes me physical pain I I believe the world is worse and humans are worse for it having known that story cool the Cobra head story depresses me a lot less you got to finish thehead story got finish didn't I finish it no there's an end part as well cuz everybody's been breeding these cobras and then the government goes oh people are breeding them and then they get rid of the bounty and then they just release all of the cobras so now it's
even worse than before yeah you think they just killed them no but like you got to keep like why would I bother now there snakes are gross well yeah but I honestly I would think it's like kind of a hassle to release a cobra I'm assuming it cuz you'd have to be near it you know or something just open toss it at the window yeah dump it off a building got it I guess but like wouldn't it be easier to just not do anything and just like Let It Die like I I I don't know I I I feel like it's a bit of a protest
give us our Bounty back ah I could see because at that point it's a business for people right yeah I could see that you my business yeah put put them on planes thanks Travis also the the the quotes about the 2000 deer whatever that was from uh creat host Sebastian I don't know if I mentioned that or not all right thanks Sebastian yeah I just like my goodness I don't know how we got on that topic let's talk about sponsors let's talk about our business yeah like from manscaped you might be drooling over the

Squarespace let's come back to Dennis's scenario for a moment oh let's say he's working from home but during work hours he wants to build an online portfolio for a job interview what why is he doing that during work hours to save time and boost his chances he should probably use our sponsor Squarespace it's an all-in-one website platform that uses AI to help anyone build a beautiful personalized website with ease they offer a variety of awardwinning templates helping you get

make it to the Finish Line if people will like it oh people like corkboards okay speaking of the scenario that Dennis just gave us yes if you were interviewing someone you're not the interviewee the interviewer yeah and they show up on camera you know you do the webcam thing oh this is a remote interview to be clear yeah yeah they show up on camera they're in the webcam thing you can tell they're in the office like at work and they booked a meeting room yeah it's a it's a bad Vibe for
that's a bad Vibe y yeah yeah I I definitely that puts me uh cuz it's like uh I don't know it's like it's like meeting your new man when he's still with her you know and I'm not saying that you should have the kind of loyalty to an employer that you would have to a significant other definitely not but yeah it's not a good vibe is all I'm saying yeah like have the have the class to like you know be somewhere else schedule it for a time when you aren't you know clearly what if you can tell yeah that
uh they're like in their car that's fine that's fine yeah so they might even still be like they they basically just went outside yeah Flappy here says it might be their lunch in which case it should be no problem for them to step out yeah and yeah because they're technically using like they're in a meeting room like they're using company property yep which maybe a rental office uh I doubt it no I understand what they're saying it could also be a work space but usually you can tell yep uh most office
spaces i' I've I've seen this happen in uh usually you can tell there's like signage in the background or there's you know the name of the meeting room on the wall whatever else we've got a segment for next week's Wan show oh yeah okay so we're going to do a tier list we are going to rank places that people are calling us from so Dan uh how's the merch message load this week do you have a little bit of time to keep an eye on the uh on the chat for a bit Yeah Okay cool so if you want to kind of put them
together and uh we're going to do we're going to do a tier list next week um and so guys if you want to hit up the float plane chat for Dan and he can kind of take some of the good suggestions that he sees and then next week Luke and I will Rank and we can we can have some you know honorable mentions for ones that are funny sure but in all seriousness let's rank how good of a foot is puts forward for locations that that you that what you would think when uh yeah I think this will be kind of fun uh if we
could have a board that um if it's possible allows me and Luke to rank things on our own without seeing each other's answers I don't know we we'll find a fun way to do it but uh you could just take that metal board Sammy had and just like tape a foam thing in the middle of yeah yeah something like that would probably work fine and then uh if we just had like little uh little print out magnets or labels we could even just have labels they don't even have to be magnetic we just peel them off after the
show but we could just put them on just with the words that that'd be kind of fun you know when I hired uh Yuki when I called him to offer him the job effectively um he was making sushi at the time and for the entire duration of that conversation he did not stop making sushi that's kind of Chad it was pretty sick I remember when I when I finally hung up I was like huh all right multitask yeah you know about the swastika that Dennis had on his wall right during his interview uh Dennis Le yeah no this
actually now rings a bell but he didn't know what it was no he was at a protest he was protesting a policy that the the sign cuz I couldn't read the sign cuz it was in Chinese so sign was like this policy is like Nazism remember yeah I remember this now yeah but I had to ask yeah you know uh what's that cuz back then you know that kind of stuff hadn't made its way into mainstream acceptance again yet um I don't know if it's acceptance you depends where you go um fair enough anyway yeah so I definitely
had to ask um but yeah he was like oh no no no no no that yeah no no no no it was either swasa or was a picture of Hitler I can't remember but either way it was it was not a good uh was not a good first impression um how many of these do you want I have 31 now I think that's more than enough so why don't we do another merch message uh yeah sure give me one sec oky dokie merch messages hi elus and Luke I have a question for you both um okay me and a friend have worked on
building a game for you're welcome your grammar has now been corrected and thank you for sending your merch message I was going to correct them for them and I thought I wouldn't they've been building a game "for 7,000 hours how do we know when it's" "ready for public beta you 10,000 hours" what what do you even that's a base "level of a skill right what 10,000 hours" I mean that's not what they're asking like Milestone wise about 6990 hours ago to be perfectly honest fail fast fail early is your f is your
game fun even no one's played it uh come on both of you are being supremely unhelpful right now supremely now do it do it right now yeah yeah what do you want do now unless it's in Alpha and it has been for a while and it's like actually all together send it to us now show where's my key yeah I'm an influencer oh look give you a shout out to 75 followers uh if for public beta I mean you can do rolling betas with steam now I I would try to get some friends that you can trust to to not puffery you
um and see if they actually have fun with the game and if they actually have fun with the game then yeah do a public test or do something else if it's in private alpha or private beta go public beta do it in small roll outs as far as my understanding goes it's pretty common in the in the small time game developer kind of space thing for people to pass their stuff back and forth and get feedback from each other and and do things that way as well so maybe join like a forum or a Discord probably a
Discord these days um and see if there's people that are interested and willing to do a little play test of your game do that Tesla Waters because there might be something that like you and the person that you're working on it with uh think is just fine because you've done it a trillion times but then someone with a perspective might might run into it and be like I don't get this and it might be fairly easy to fix so I I would I would do it that way first and then then try to hit it with something
else or you have to redesign the entire thing which happens a lot too something that you are okay with nobody seems to be okay with Genesis says that's been a source of hacking too yeah of course any any time that there's file sharing in any Community it's a source of hacking uh you can open it in in uh some type of secure system whatever doesn't pirate software help with this kind of thing I have no idea that sounds like it would an incredible amount of work considering the size of creator that he
is all right hit us with one more Dan hey you guys did a sponsored video on sleep buds sure did how are they are you still using them um also saw the announcement video has 21 million views insane for a product launch like this all right a couple things uh here so first of all uh even in a sponsored video I won't say anything that I do not genuinely believe uh first of all it's against FTC guidelines uh second of all it would completely nuke my credibility that doesn't mean I've never said
anything that has turned out to not be true um but what I do make a point of is separating things that are talking points from the brand and are clearly provided by the brand and things that I think and I won't say anything about my own opinion that isn't actually true regardless of whether it is sponsored or not sponsored this has nuked many a sponsor deal um caused many an issue for our poor business team the hardworking Souls that they are but it is not something that there's any
flexibility on for us and I have even um very recently actually lectured other hosts and writers about making sure that they hold their ground and do not allow any words to be put in their mouth that they do not agree with um one of our writers was told uh by someone in the production chain um hey um can you just record this as a pickup uh in case the brand requires it and uh hopefully we won't have to use it and it was something that they weren't 100% comfortable with not because they didn't
like the product or because it was wrong it was just a little more enthusiastic than they were the tone was not how they actually felt about it I overheard this conversation and I basically said look I got a really good piece of advice device once on a shoot um for a car commercial that I did like years and years ago and um I was told to say something about the the definition of the screen and the center display and I said hey well uh okay what's the actual pixel count
because I'm not going to say those words if I don't know that it's like something that aligns with those words like I'm a tech guy that's my entire identity is that I wouldn't say high definition unless it actually had a pixel count that could correspond to high definition if you just mean like like reasonably fine PPI then then I'll have to say that like I have to say what it actually is and they like gave me a really hard time and they asked me to do the same thing they asked me to record it both ways the
way that I wanted to say it that hedged and the way that was exactly their words and then they would find out and they would you know make sure before they do the edit and I said no I'm not going to do that you have like 30 people here I think you guys can figure it out this is going to delay us like 5 minutes just call somebody and find out what the pixel count is and the DP who was shooting it after they like stormed off because it was kind of it got kind of heated and I was like I'm not going to
do it I need you guys to figure this out uh the DP leans over and he's like look I'm on their payroll today but good job never shoot something that you don't believe that you don't want to be used because they'll use it B and because that's the thing right it's my contract entitles them to everything I shot that day I didn't get it in writing that they wouldn't use it so like from a legal standpoint unless I can prove we had that conversation absolutely will yeah it's not it's not it's either not
binding or it's not worth me pursuing at that point the easier thing to do is to just never shoot it um so long story short long story short the brand got it all figured out and it turned out their talking points were fine sure it doesn't matter though but I just needed to know it's the principle I needed to know um and so so coming back to your question everything I said in the video was true um I have been using them I haven't been using them every single night um there
are definitely advantages to my regular airpods Pros in fact I used my airpods Pros last night they're just convenient because I don't there's no pairing process or anything like that however with that said my airpods Pros fell out last night and I woke up and then uh I woke up really early this morning and they were dead so I couldn't put anything back on so the Sleep buds would have fixed both of those problems if I had put in the effort as I was going to bed of bothering to pair them and put them in
so uh yeah no they're they're pretty sweet as for the however many what was it you said 14 million views on the  this hold on I can't even I can't even find this video Oslo sleep I I do not see anything with 21 million views oh here it is never mind popular okay how many coms so this "channel has uh 1,000" subscribers um this video is from 11 months ago has 21 million views and has 12 comments yeah so so these are paid views um so that's how it has 21 million views which is fine when you say that I think
a lot of people are going to interpret that as boted views oh no not that he means it was ran as an advertisement on YouTube yeah and when a advertisement is ran on YouTube there is a video that you can go find that it actually is it's they're really just playing a YouTube video before your YouTube video so you can find the ad that's the ad um but people don't comment on the ad so there's almost no comments on the video in fact I can show you guys uh a really fun example of how that works because uh
that video that Elijah and I worked on for yvon's movie night in the pool uh the analytics look super funky for it oh no oh that's right you can't go back and look at historical real time H okay well shoot yeah it's been it's been too oh I might have a did I take a screenshot no I didn't take a screenshot okay know people showed me but I think it was live on their phone the real time view used to to look like a really high Spike and then it went like this and then it went and then like another Decay and
then went and then it went like flat like this that is not normal normally when you first release a video it starts high and then it kind of just tapers out and then over time eventually it might kind of you know have some spikes and dips and that kind of thing uh but instead this followed a super weird curve compared to our typical you can actually see uh here there you go you can kind of see this was it petering out and this was the first ad spend that high sense did
and then it tapers off a little bit and then here's some more ad spend and then they stopped so it actually reports as normal views in your dashboard but you can see this estimated revenue is more reflective of a video that got like a million and a half views not 3.8 million views so those extra views compared to usual so it did well were purchased views from high it didn't do as well as it looks and what's unfortunate is it kind of mucks with your analytics cuz this retention looks really bad because
most people click off of ads um so that's something um which I think might we also noticed Channel performance went down a little bit after this video like I think that may impact like our our like Channel momentum and stuff too so we don't really have I don't think we have a clear policy for whether someone is allowed to buy ads against our videos when they sponsor a video but maybe that's something we'll have to look at cuz it seems like by juicing this video we got a lot of like
abandonment of this video and given that they're going to be targeting our demographic if that counts as abandonment of LTT videos that might mean that less likely to serve them the next ones which is like legit except that the it was an ad it wasn't a video that they navigated to so that kind of makes sense because I I expected the video to do better and I expected the secret shopping my own store video to kind of kill so we might have to ask brand oh you know what we could do is we
could have a like a garbage Channel and we can ask Brands to use the like garbage Channel version of the video um Dan that's an interesting idea do you mind actually sending just a note to uh actually uh me and I'll follow that up next week I'll suggest that to the business team cuz then would you like it scheduled or do you want me to send it to you oh just whenever it doesn't matter okay yeah my inbox is basically my to-do list um yeah we know the intro is cringe  purpose it uh yeah apparently spiffing
Brit did a video on this and serving a video as an ad does affect it in the algorithm oh I I I I understand it will affect that video but what I'm wondering is whether it affects the profile of that viewer that abandoned an LTT video and makes it less likely to serve them LTT because given how hard fought like how hard one momentum like that is to lose any of it over something like this feels just unnecessary and frustrating I don't know that it did um but uh silic covid says how cold was it actually in
the pool it seemed you guys were really in there for a while um the pool was great being the top half of us being outside the pool was miserable in fact I'd never experienced this before but with how cold my skin got outside the pool and like rain and cold when I finally did jump into the pool which was still heated it was crazy cuz you know we keep our pool like quite warm for a pool but it was still a pool temperature but I got in it felt like a hot tub cuz I've never tried that
before so that's a thing that uh if you've if you've like done that before you'll know but now I know for a few months there was doing hot cold cycles and wow yeah I would imagine that would be painful cuz if if a pool felt like a hot tub a hot T tub would have been like pretty unpleasant I would think it was uh it wasn't a hot tub it was a sauna but yeah it was hot it was really hot it was a cold bath in a sauna apparently with spiffing Brit's video you purposely place the worst audience
in interests I.E senior book readers on a video game video and that'll nuke all the channels analytics after the spike from ad serving oh interesting so yeah maybe that maybe we we do need to do that okay cool well we'll get that we'll get that sorted out and we won't do that again yoes want to talk about McDonald soft serve machines yeah cuz I uh I had read an article on this already and it was misleading I have read our notes now and I Now understand what's going on what I
said at the beginning of the show was wrong in response to a petition from iFixit and nonprofit public interest group public knowledge the US copyright office has granted a partial exemption to the dmca that allows restaurant owners to diagnose and repair their own equipment and where Luke got a little bit confused and maybe it goes to show you how full of misinformation the internet can be these days I read an article that said the partial exemption was for McDonald's yeah yeah like I yeah anyway
um so so Luke kind of thought oh this is like what to help pad McDonald's Pockets No in fact this is to go against if you if man the m soft Ser machines are such a rabbit hole it's fascinating it is actually very interesting very interesting but what this does instead is it actually removes the incentive for McDonald's corporate and their Partners to um not allow franchise owners to repair their own equipment because it turns out those service calls are extremely lucrative and if they let them
repair their own equipment it could be done cheaper ly and faster which means more chil treats for you in the summer since the machines will be far less likely to be broken um and it mostly impacts franchise owners who a lot of the time are not huge corporate fat cats they are people who have a lot of their monthly Revenue uh being paid to the huge corporate fat cats but actually are just in the restaurant business which can be a very challenging business um so this decision is a blow to tailor the
manufacturer of these machines which has historically made a large part of its income from repair calls and has fought third-party attempts to repair its purposely finicky machines that's a big part of the rabbit hole is that it does appear as though the machines are intentionally obtuse and difficult to deal with sick yeah freaking love it very good yeah there's lots of good videos people in the chat are recommending Matt Pat's video on it um the the whole ice cream machine Fiasco um I've seen I've
seen other good ones I wish I could remember right now but there's definitely really good ones you know this is a this is a weird aside but I was talking to my brother my brother's a firefighter and uh they cook it's like a a culture thing they they cook all their own meals so the the kitchen in the fire hall is like really important the you know the the people that are on probation have to make muffins all the time and all this kind of stuff and you're expected to like actually be able
to cook pretty well because it's going to cycle around who's cooking and you're cooking all the meals for all the firefighters that are on shift that day right and it rotates who does it so you're like you're actually expected to like know what you're doing and be pretty good like he was practicing at home um they have special Ovens that will turn off when they get fire calls oh that's super cool it's like kind of sick actually so clearly they they have this other problem where
the like control panel or something thing is where all the steam comes out so the control panel like fries itself constantly but then they like have to use that one oven cuz it turns itself off when the so it's like ah anyways uh there's a lot of good comments about this uh clapped 4 24 a cord clapped K24 Accord okay it doesn't matter uh the point is they said fast food equipment in general is ridiculous to repair way too expensive apparently "it's $3,500 to replace a control unit in"
a Tim Horton oven um this is all this is all hearsay um and then uh uh nplus cage says I work maintenance for corporate 7-Eleven and the maintenance game is they've been in flo plane chat forever just any anytime someone says their name it's just like what whiz tick says I'm high as I love float plane you guys are awesome maybe a little unrelated same here you're on shift oh no um this is actually a perfect segue so you know having a little bit of healthy skepticism when you read
something on the Internet I should have had more skepticism last week we've got an update on the Congo attack ad so remember that thing last week where the teacher supposedly was blaming me for for resource mining or whatever else um yeah we have since learned via post from a second student that was in the same class that that was a mockup example in a media literacy assignment where students were expected to make similar pretend attack ads the teacher describes himself as a big LT fan which
is how he became aware that his attack ad had escaped his classroom which was the only place it was intended to be seen so unfortunate we have gotten in contact with the teacher in question and asked them hey do you want an opportunity to tell your side of the story and he graciously agreed to send us a pre-recorded video statement let's go ahead and play it which is so coolt crew I was asked to create this video uh to respond to the Reddit post so here I am so I'm going to go ahead and read the
statement that I wrote a student recently took a photo of a lesson component out of context and it online where it was shared widely the isolated image misrepresented the intent and content of the lesson leading to a false and hurtful characterization of My Views the lesson was based on a poem by Derek Walcott's poem elsewhere and focused on highlighting atrocities happening around the world then students were asked to create political attack ads bringing awareness to set
atrocities to illustrate these Concepts I cre created an example ad which the student then posted online it's crucial to understand that this example was for illustrative purposes only did not reflect my personal views lonus himself is really good at encouraging people to buy used and refurbished electronics and isn't isn't anywhere close to problematic in my eyes he's the note 9 goat while the online post was Anonymous it has caused some significant distress for me it's disheartening to see my work
misconstrued and used to create a misleading narrative especially since I'm a big LT fan and watch the Channel all the time which is how I found out about this to begin with so to put this whole thing to bed I don't think lus is solely responsible for what happened in the Congo it was just an example that's all signing out what an absolute Chad okay the version that he recorded is a little different from the written version that I read did it not have the note 9 he added some
flavor honestly I think like and he added the bit at the end about how I'm not solely responsible for it which I also thought was pretty funny I I think it's a a cool engaging project to do I I don't know he seems like he's probably a fantastic teacher yeah ninja man away says send that man some merch yeah I think we need to get him a package I think we need to get him a care package Dan do you mind noting that down as something to uh maybe flag that for for Mr AP speaking of people who are goated
um our our customer care lead over at uh Creator Warehouse uh let's get let's get something over to him because we we clearly we clearly need to make up for all the damage that we've done to the Congo honestly in a in a in a way it's it's a like super success of the project because it showed the efficacy of this type of stuff absolutely so like his lesson plan just worked like way too well y yeah he demonstrated how powerful you know outrage culture can be and how how much reach something can have when
it elicits such an emotional response in the viewer yeah um yeah great job great job i' I'd love to send him something like super cool like maybe we could get him we have a handful of photo samples of the new backpack oh I don't know I don't know if they're going to let me have any of those but but we'll put something together yeah the the the commuter bag oh okay okay okay yeah I was like are you leaking something here no no no no no I don't know we'll figure something out we'll figure something out
okay we'll figure something out but it'd be cool to get him something like like one of one or something that's like you know early or something something cool something Co I just think it's cool cuz like I mean I be used stuff I had lot stuff we didn't need anymore I had I don't want to I don't want to hurt any more kids in the con that could be kind of cool by the way I have still been carrying the note 9 even though uh I'm reviewing the iPhone is that is this type of thing
what we could use the remaining Lambo beanies for ah no no we have a plan for them okay okay okay cool yeah um it's not a great plan I I think it's I think it's cool I don't know I I had such a r I think everybody does I had such a range of teachers when I was going to school I had the teacher that like would literally just sit there with the textbook and read it or they would put scans of the textbook on the thing and just tell you to read it when you have the textbook like it's just they might
not it might as well not even be there like there there's no point in going to their class we had one that literally wasn't there a lot of the time he would go to the cafeteria if you had the block before lunch he would assign everyone's silent reading and this is in like grade eight when you don't need to do silent reading in class no he would assign everyone to like read and he would disappear for like 20 minutes at a time out of a 50-minute block and he'd go to the cafeteria and like sample food ahead
of time because he was like buddies with the people in the cafeteria I was like this is ridiculous that is ridiculous but then you have great teachers like like this guy seems to be that'll like go out of their way to create cool projects and engaging ways to like actually learn cuz at least for me when I was going to school if it was just book work like chance that's getting done is not super high um but if it was like some weird engaging different not necessarily expected project way to engage with the
learning in a different way stuff like that man I would be all over that so I don't know this seems like a very creative assignment and I'm really glad that he was kind enough to put himself out there and uh come and talk about you know how he actually felt like about that you know honestly I think uh we we probably haven't talked enough about how important it is to articulate the damage that this kind of cyber bullying can cause I think he did a great job of just talking about like how it made him felt
and what the impact was you can tell this is someone that has a lot of experience um dealing with like which let's be honest a lot of high school high schoolers are high school teacher and like explaining in the simplest possible terms why like doing a bad thing is bad yeah it was it was well written well well read as well yeah did a great job yeah uh all right what else do we got this week Dan what are we supposed to be doing Instagram head yeah just so run out the rest of your topics Instagram
head confirms they lower the quality of unpopular Clips in a recent video AMA head of Instagram Adam moseri stated that the platform demotes unpopular Clips to a lower level of video quality however this will reverse if the video gains traction again moseri claims that it is only a small bump in quality doesn't make com competing harder for smaller creators okay that makes sense how would they know I don't know a really difficult thing to me everyone would start as a small Creator
so theoretically it's a Level Playing Field I guess fair enough well no but you know also kind of it's a free platform guys and at the end of the day content is King a difference in video quality on a platform like Instagram where quite frankly the video looks like butt anyway um no one cares unfortunately I wish they did float plane would do better if they did they don't it is what it is our discussion question is would you do the same if you were in their position yeah probably all
right see you later what else we got for today it's a free like Dan won't be telling us I what I would especially do is really old clips that haven't uh been accessed in a long time oh that's definitely a thing yeah like you go back like way far back on like your Facebook timeline or whatever and you like try to like open a photo it like takes a second oh but that's not grabbing off a hard drive yeah that but that that's not necessarily the quality level of it oh this is just bandwidth conservation yeah
sure yeah well it's also probably affected by storage too because anything higher quality or more viral they're going to be cashing it near to you expensive storage and yeah yeah yeah that too at the end of the day architecting this stuff at the scale that they operate at is extremely complicated yeah and little changes like this which I I actually believe uh Adam moseri it probably doesn't really make much of a difference to almost anybody but who it is g to make a pretty big difference to
is probably them when it comes to their bills like uh on on the on the scale that Instagram is doing this will probably save them tons but it unlikely to make any real difference to users or creators Scrappy DP asks do old float plane Clips lose quality the answer is no float plane is not uh growing at or even targeting growing at the kind of exponential rate that your kind of your VC funded businesses of close big Tech businesses are expecting and so even though storage costs are only falling a little bit
these days compared to how they used to um our our storage costs and our storage needs are kind of doing okay so we can maintain everything the way that it was we we do drank uh like we have we have like ranks of storage but not of of quality effectively so like if something's not accessed for a long time it's going to fall back to hard drives if something starts getting feverishly accessed like a flow plane exclusive uh LTT thing or something like that uh that'll that'll
sit in in higher tier storage so it can be pulled easier is what it is want to play some AI Minecraft yes AI company Dart has publicly released s like a duck call yeah I don't know throat was weird uh has publicly released Oasis which is a playable AI model trained on Minecraft currently you can only play for a few minutes at most and it's only playable on Chrome the results are description trippy okay uh do you want to play or should I play or like oh I'm going to need a mouse
probably I mean it's Minecraft give me a sec give me a sec I got one yeah okay you play then do they call it ow M it's trained on Minecraft is this stupid metal board that Sammy had for this stupid tear thing just whacked me in the shin please don't get blood on this set dude my head bled from the shoot I did yesterday with David I stood up and I hit my head on his Borg computer oh those are words that'll make sense once  okay zuuk Kaku says Borg computer not Bor not Bor Bor Bor
computer um dude we did uh we did a bit of a different extreme upgrade or Ultimate Upgrade or you know whichever branding we're using for it right now um David paid for everything so instead of having a sponsor for it it's just oh yeah no I like this idea I think just we were talking about doing this at some point yeah it's just a video where like David's doing an upgrade any excuse me anyway and we make a video about it get some get some labor the quid pro quo was a that I and Rees would like help him
with it for the day Reese not Elija um maybe I'll go down this route yeah you might not end up with too many extra holes in exct um so Ree and I were there for the day helping him with things so like I built his os's computer and uh you know helped with the mountain of his custom painted USS Enterprise and stuff like that and um and also that we did that video promoting him selling his collection which was actually which got it extra exposure which helped his budget so it was like and then in return
you know he's giving us his space and you know his upgrade and he probably spent some money on things that he probably wouldn't have to make it a little more interesting anyway dude I should I should con you into painting my place the space ends up super cool I did no painting which was nice um and I hit my head oh I forget where I was going with this but In fairness to me I recently hit my head so anyway  muted you are about to enter a first ofit kind video model is there sound a
game engine trained by millions of gameplay hours every step you take will  time so are they going to get sued to  crap hold on I'm on it m which one uh there's a volume thing on the top left of Oasis what you talking about Willis yeah mute that okay cool so that is only coming from that then okay so we're good so VX C unmute here we go boys  okay what do you want what what do you what do you all want to see um maybe we go for rugged Coastline and just go BC okay a sheer drop from towering Peaks
crumbling into the ocean below trees balance over the water and waves crash over rocks ready for adventure waiting for your turn ridden by AI oh um waiting for your turn dang it did all of you all jump on here oh hold on hold on hold on positioning q29 ETA 12 seconds oh okay we got this does the position in Q go down there it is nice  it okay can you press button like can you select the different items that you have I mean I don't know  uh is it super laggy uh oh it's
definitely a little laggy yeah what yeah what happens if you limit your frame of view and then look up uh hold on I'm doing a thing here oh um okay I don't think you are okay so I look up oh no I I meant I meant like out in the world like did it change yeah there you go TR is interesting uh I don't think it's able  stairway  go what the heck is that thing moving this is like your Minecraft game dropped a t yeah yeah uh huh H okay what's going to be over the honestly it makes the exploration
kind of fun uh can I can I build a path for myself like is that possible can I is that how this works is that how any of this works okay yeah I can maybe with this Starfield wouldn't have been a useless pile of junk no oh okay okay what's up there what's up there I want to I want to get I want to see what's supposed to be there are you kidding me W there's a structure whoa whoa Am I who is that a v whoa dude I kept going up to like the but I made my way away from the the mountain that
was I was on there's no long waa like did you see what happened there W as he just turned everything's changing I was climbing a mountain and looking up and it became just like whatever was in front of me this is some Inception kind of stuff dude Village gone this is crazy crazy who needs drugs when you can just play this game well wait until they have this kinde of stuff for VR wow okay I think I've had enough kind  um this is just a glimpse into the future of interactive AI experiences 
imagine as far as my understanding goes they have it they have somewh running on Asic cards yeah the playable model was made possible by super fast inference thanks to an Asic card with the model's Transformer architecture physically  etched our discussion questions are what do you think of the game well I mean it's obviously just Minecraft because it's trained on Minecraft um how close is it to actual Minecraft it asks I mean in terms of like how it felt to play other than being super leggy it like
felt like Minecraft felt like Minecraft honestly yeah like the movement and everything does it take much to get you there um Maybe not maybe not that much jump attack is a hold button y yeah I didn't try to run I guess I could have tried to do more things um our next question though is how good is its object permanence and there I would say Things Fall Apart a little bit that's the whole reason why the demo is fun um yeah yeah how bad it is is is sort of the most interesting thing about
it with that said it's also kind of crazy the fact that this exists at all yeah with no game engine yeah with no cuz it's it's bad because it's not very playable but it's also amazing because it exists yeah the fact that this is a thing at all is mindblowing um with that said it is very clear that we are an awful long way away from our gpus just being neural processing units and um and this being a gaming experience that uh that anyone would would want yeah yeah I give it six
months would be kind of cool if that ended up being an add-in card though I'd be down to go back to multiple add-in cards that'd be sick yeah get your physics card in there get your sound card in there get your neural card in there well if Nvidia has their way the GPU will eventually morph into a neural neural pu and then it'll just like have a GPU component on it CU you'll always need to Output um and you'll always need to play Legacy games and stuff like that but pretty cool uh lucky falor says it's
like the impossible staircase illusion with that mountain yeah that was that was trippy cuz I was trying to look up the mountain I made my way to like a landscape in front of me somehow I was like okay I mean yeah I guess in I guess there is no up in video games if you think about it so why would it right CU you could move a mouse up infinitely theoretically right like there's no gravity in a video game like like it's all it's all it's all artificial yeah like we create up and we create down but
but this AI model is not constrained by that what's up in real life exactly exactly it's away from the center of the Earth but because but what if you're not on the earth anymore where's up now no I just what no I'm trying to make a point right now so up in the video game is away from the center of your thing um sorry what center of the game world yeah but it stopped having a center yeah yeah so like so theoretically this this AI model is not constrained by that you could just you
could just keep going up you could have more than 360° like it's just I'm just screwing with a modest Panda don't worry about   guy I'm a down enjoyer myself like naturally sourced or artificial you know what you might enjoy is using a convenient app that is readily available to track world leaders ah yeah according to journalists at French newspaper Leon it is apparently possible to track the location of President Emanuel maon by identifying his bodyguards many of whom
have Public Accounts under their legal names on straa a fitness app with social networking elements this means that they have been publicly posting their running routes including Geo dat which means where are they where is the president yes problem it is also apparently possible to do the same with other world leaders including the US president and both both presidential candidates this is not a new problem in 2023 a Russian submarine Commander was killed while jogging the commander had a
straa account under his own name which his as salent may have used to track his regular Roots yeah so this one wasn't bodyguards it was the actual guy um Andre B says wasn't there something about soldiers identifying secret bases the same way yes I believe that did happen with a um with a secret US military installation of some kind there's a lot of these types of problems there's even more subtle ones that I don't think people really properly consider um because like when this when
the when the 2023 thing happened with the the Russian submarine Commander um I think that brought to light to a bunch of people like oh maybe I should consider this one that I point out fairly often um when I meet parents of kids and those uh the the Kid Likes playing Pokémon go and the parent is just like you know being supportive but doesn't really understand what's going on is I like to point out that when you give gifts in the game the gifts come with a postcard of where the gift came
from and you get gifts in the game by spinning stops but you are most likely to spin the stop that is closest to your house most often so people can figure out where you live based on being  I don't know CH 5609 says this is like people figuring out that deep was going down because of a higher number of pizza orders to the Pizza Hut dominoes near the Pentagon that's a longterm thing they they they are actually like trackers for that and stuff cuz it's like a reliable metric that doesn't seem
to be becoming less reliable yeah nice Washington Pizza index yeah exactly the pizza index yeah this is like totally a thing YouTube users have been reporting missing view counts and upload dates uh there's a Reddit post from four months ago um know some users recently though found that there were no longer view counts or upload dates on YouTube's homepage this led to reporting that YouTube might be performing another experiment YouTube however has responded and says this is actually a bug that is typically
experienced by users with certain browser extensions enabled the company suggests disabling these extensions and a report if the issue continues so our discussion question here this just came up because someone pled it for me recently uh do you think this is a YouTube experiment or another attack on Adblock would you find that it would degrade the experience of YouTube for you if you didn't know the upload date and how many  yes I'm going to play Devil's Advocate although I understand why you wouldn't
want that because it could potentially really help small creators I'm going to why I wouldn't want what uh why you wouldn't want it to show view counts why I wouldn't want it to yeah because if you're a if you're a really small Creator you don't want people to not click on your video just because it has 200 views yeah no no that would be I could see how that leveled how that could level the playing field in a big way yeah yeah upload dat would I want what would I not want
though huh oh I thought you said you said I wouldn't want it what would I not want I was just trying to figure that out I don't remember the exact reference oh of the moment of when I said that oh okay I object to this mostly as a user I'm not really thinking about it as a Creator however I'm going to play Devil's Advocate against my own argument and I'm going to kind of share an observation that has materialized for me over a while it's bothered me a lot for years that Netflix doesn't
show the popularity of things like not in a not in a in a universal way they'll have like popular for people like you you know they'll have stuff like that they don't show things like critical Acclaim or like a Rotten Tomatoes rating or anything like that basically they just merchandise the movie or TV show or whatever it is with photos and descriptions and kind of present it to you and algorithmically track what kind of what works for you and what you like and what you don't and and and they kind
of they they make that whole thing work right and one of the things that I've observed is that my family watches almost nothing on Plex and gravitates towards Netflix far more than Plex even though the library on Plex is actually much larger and I realized for myself that when I go to try to find something to watch on Plex it's really hard and one of the reasons that I kind of I had kind of a light bulb moment one of the reasons is the data having the data of how good something is makes it so much harder to
find something that you know what I might actually end up enjoying even if it's not good I will almost universally enjoy something that has super high critical Acclaim and also audiences love it like the wild robot is outstanding just go watch it don't question it just go watch it um was just a great film um but there are times when I will enjoy something that is not critically acclaimed for example major pain got a 29% rating on the Tomato Meter from critics and even 68% like if you know
the film you'll know that 68% for a film of this genre is actually pretty good it's a pretty polarizing film um and I was thinking about how if I saw something that was rated 20 29% by critics and 68% by audiences in my Plex I probably wouldn't bother watching it and so I guess where where I'm coming back to in all of this is maybe the metadata that they give us coming back even to like dislike ratio crazy that some things have a relationship when it comes to audience score yeah I mean I
think the uh critics are probably right on that one but and maybe part of it is that you watched hackers when you were young yeah and I watched it as an adult and I watched major pain when I was young I also think I'm into the subject matter have you seen major pain yes oh okay and you thought it was like dumb or bad no I thought it was funny oh okay um so so the problem with like dislike when YouTube removed that was that there's a lot of content where it's really important to be able to see that kind of
rating because they don't have a community notes system they don't have anything equivalent if if a guide for how to repair your dishwasher is like not very good uh or if uh you know a moon landing conspiracy video is a conspiracy video and is like something irrelevant that we shouldn't be watching um they don't really have an equivalent for that and and so the like dislike ratio was at least a useful barometer of potential usefulness or quality um but view counts upload dates upload date
might be upload date depending on what you're looking for if what YouTube seeks to be is just an entertainment platform where people watch as much as possible why do they seem to be killing Evergreen content if they're going to get rid of upload dates though I don't know that they're killing Evergreen content it doesn't seem to be doing as well we could probably have a much longer conversation about that I think some of our Evergreen content is struggling a little bit we upload a lot
um we are Tech Centric which can make even less relevant yeah even our Evergreen content I think is less Evergreen than say well I was going to say comedy but comedy can come some sometimes it AG just like fine milk but depending on the content some some things are more Evergreen than others uh the guide for how to repair this Dishwasher model is Evergreen because that Dishwasher model will always be that Dishwasher model well unless people have it this is true this is true unless
it's a really um important one and people would restore them maybe it's the uh maybe it's the firehouse one sure sure and people always need to fix it anyway um the point is that maybe they could expand people's Horizon which could be a benefit even if it comes with them tradeoffs and they could improve their own internal metrics which are increasing watch Time by actually giving us far less measurable like like um uh empirical data about a piece of content thoughts I might enjoy my Plex Library
more what I'm trying to say is I might enjoy my Plex Library more if I didn't know how good something was I think there's too many things that I watch on YouTube that the like think about wow W show vods you're watching a w show that's 2 years old it is out of date sort of we have a lot of conversations that are useful you know for the history of tech and that are not on topic yeah history of tech though sure so what if what if we have a w show and the title is like Google killed the company [Applause]
again and then you're like oh what did they kill this time and then you're like wait how long does it take you to figure out that this happened years ago and they're not talking about the 87 things that they've killed in between then and now like that's I don't know yeah it it it leaves you to like you have to sit there and watch the video to figure out if this is actually a video that you want to watch or not instead of being able to just look at the date and be like okay got it which is good for the
platform or it gets people to just leave the platform entirely cuz it's annoying I came across this video in my shorts feed actually speaking of this um Kyle it was Kyle from bitwit and the reason it um the reason I noticed it in my shorts feed was because the thumbnail had um this Frame of me in it and I was like sorry what when was when was Kyle from bitwit talking about me and I clicked on it and I realized like how OB fiscated things are now so okay we've got likes there's no view count so this
is already like happening this is already the the direction the interface is going I can't see how many subscribers Kyle has in fact what drove me oh this is interesting Oh weird the uh this has the channel name but the uh this oh my gosh I swear I swear the screenshot that I sent to our rep earlier today did not oh so trippy okay so when I navigated to this not from his channel Kyle Kyle uh Luke can confirm yeah confirmed there you're talking there's no channel name no subscribe button
there's no way for me to get information about who he even is which sort of flies in the face of YouTube's claims that the shorts can be like a funnel for your for your V the opposite of that yeah it was like I I was like what the heck is this I have no way of I have no way of finding this anyway my point is I think it would be a terrible thing for YouTube because of the vastly different way that people use YouTube compared to a movie library but in general maybe less data
could be a good thing that's all I'm trying to say and uh I guess my question was would degrading the experience in this way make you less likely to use an ad block blocker if this was one of the levers that they decided to pull if you're an ad blocker they just like remove other elements of the page uh yeah probably would that harm your your use of the platform I think for a pretty considerable amount of YouTube viewing that I do it would it would do that yeah yeah Cory as the name says I find myself
judging fictional books intensely if I see their rating prior to reading I think about that rating throughout the process of reading the book and I end up losing some of my focus on the content itself um yeah a date isn't a rating though like I understand what you're saying with the with the like to dislike side of things but a a date is not a rating a date is a um I don't know sometimes a very old video can communicate that it it could be a very quality thing and sometimes a very new
video is kind of a requirement if you're trying to keep up to date on what's happening in US politics and you look up something to do with um Trump for example and running for election yeah it could be the or the 2020 election yeah like it sounds super annoying to be completely honest like there there's certain things that are just timely um what if you wanted to find something from the 2016 what if they used AI to determine whether a video really needs a date on it or
not nas says YouTube has confirmed it's not testing removing it it was a side effect I know it just prompted a conversation that's all I just wanted to talk about it it's a side effect of certain add-ons or something side effect of your face yeah extensions we we we said that earlier but they might be tuning in a little did they say what kind of extensions no okay who knows what kind uh Dan I think that's it for the topics on the W show this week do you want to switch us over
it after dark okay I can do that absolutely let's do it wow there's so many of you watching today date is context yeah like I don't know I think the date matters I get it no to be clear I want the date but like would I be more likely to watch it's a wonderful world if I didn't know that it was like old maybe see I think it could add value though or like tootsy you know cuz like the fact that whatever just like some old movie the fact that we both know the name It's a Wonderful World means or
wonder I think isn't that my dad oh it suppos to turn phrase no no that's the uh what a wonderful that's the song okay sure basically I don't know either of them is what we're coming to on conclusion but I know the the phrase so if I saw that and I saw the date I'm like oh I know this name it's super old that probably means it was amazing so I'm going to check this out but it could go either way like if you hear someone in modern times say hey Schindler's List is like an amazing
movie like okay and then you see that it's old it might go like oh it was amazing enough for them to still care about it despite it not being a new release maybe I'll watch that I don't know different people it could communicate uh value different people have different perspectives like uh Ivonne for example doesn't like watching old media she just finds especially the audio quality when you go back a certain amount is like not good enough for her to enjoy um like they're they their
sound recording techniques if you go back to like the' 70s early ' 80s were not as good and it's not as clean as it is now doesn't bother me I think it adds some charm but I I can understand having a different perspective on that uh Dan do you want to hit us with some merge messages yeah sure hi LDL recently my desktop YouTube page has reduced the amount of thumbnails to three per row leaving me with six videos on full screen forcing me to scroll more do you have any thoughts on this trend I've
seen some people complaining about this um I personally am a huge proponent of higher density I mean but maybe part of that is a generational Gap thing like when I was a kid screens were small and resolution was low and every upgrade was so that you could fit more stuff on the screen and so the screen would be bigger so you could see more at a time a very interesting Rabbit Hole to go down is North American versus Japanese web design oh man they're like violently opposite dude it's crazy but they are
successful in their areas it's not just that like you know Japanese web designers just feel like doing it some other way no they just don't give a no it works better with Japanese audiences and then when you when you try to put American Web Design in front of Japanese audiences they don't they don't like it as much they don't engage with it as much I don't remember all the details then when you put Japanese web design Styles in front of American audiences they're like you get a reaction like
this delain in float plane chat says I legitimately cannot stand Japanese web design it's insane to me yeah yeah but they work really well within their cultures it's very interesting it's actually a genuinely very interesting Rabbit Hole part of my feelings about it could also be a generational Gap oh wait did I already say that part well okay I have another supporting uh piece of this um cuz Ivonne was talking to some other people internally here like younger people gen Z people and uh she was
talking about booking a trip and uh they were like oh well you know whatever and yvon's like oh well yeah I can't look at that right now I'm not at my computer and they go well what you don't just book lights on your phone she's like no who would do that they're like me me me me me me me me me it is inferior ifon is correct uh it is vastly inferior Ivon is 100% correct but apparently that's a big generational Gap thing is that Millennials will the new generation is wrong go to the computer to do certain
things and booking travel is one of them whereas jz's will absolutely just use their phone to do stuff like that even though they obviously cannot do a good enough job of it in comparison shopping and without using spreadsheets and but that is very much an our Generation thing even think this we're wrong about a lot of things we're correct about that to screen big purchase to even think about using the desktop going to use the computer you know but yeah 100% the bigger the
purchase the better the chance that I want to use a big screen to do it sure and the same accounts but it feels weird having money go through my phone do you know what I mean like I'm on the Amazon app on my phone but money has to go through it no even just like buying a little thing oh I no I don't mind that I I if I just like need something right now R based uh what what it say as a Zoomer I agree with PC being Superior for big purchases and like there's certain things where I'll use both
depending on the context so if I'm just like browsing houses for the ls like I'm looking at the most expensive houses for sale in Vancouver right now I'll do that on my phone I don't care I'm just like Doom scrolling like nonsense I'm looking at people's fancy houses if I am shoing dude Research phone are you kiding sometime sometimes I'll I'll I'll I'll go look over at North Van and just slide that that willing to pce scale up just be like you know if I just had a helicopter I can just fly into work that
I don't mind doing on my phone sick yeah exactly but like if I'm actually shopping no I got to be on my computer man I got to be on my computer mhm I'm a gamerg Garder and just got an OLED TV LG C3 and want to get an QD OLED monitor but I'm worried about the purple Hue I have grow lights on 69 hours a day and never use my computer in the dark it's very unlikely to bother you I mean the first example I have of this is my old aperture Grill um CRT okay it had these two little lines across the screen
um for the like alignment wires and I read reviews and people were like oh yeah it's like it's annoying it's this and then other people were like oh no yeah you forget about it and I got it I brought it home I unpacked it and I was like they're really annoying they bother me so much uh they're visible especially on white backgrounds which you know going back to the early 2000s mid 2000s was basically every web page right like everything was there was no dark mode and I was on the brink of returning it
and paying it like 15% restocking fee at NC or whatever it was I think it was 15% right so that sounds correct and then I gave it a little bit longer and then I forgot they were there and the purple Hue is kind of like that yeah you'll notice it it'll be super noticeable when you know about it and then you'll be playing a game and it'll be like half an hour later and You' be like oh I haven't thought about the purple Hue in a while I wouldn't stress about it too much I I remembered something about the
Japanese versus American website design thing it had something to do with like uh like aisc of information and desire for Comfort versus knowledge and the Japanese web design leans more towards information overload and the American Web Design leans more towards comfort and you know you're just going to trust that this is going to be legit whatever it's interesting I don't remember all the details it's actually like a fairly deep topic if you guys are interested but that was I remember that
being sort of one of the one of the concepts by the way enjoy your grow lights and uh maybe try that weird AI Minecraft thing that dude can't even imagine yeah good day boys from Down Under I'm planning to build a new pc and pretty sold on the 9000 x3d Series do you think the 9800 x3d is going to be the best bet should I hold out for something better how are you pretty sold on that already no comment how how you what's going on we know too much yeah to answer this question you shouldn't be sold on
something before independent reviews are out um I would encourage you to watch ours I would also encourage you to watch  yeah uh lius when you were on the yard how close were you to walking out when they did their DJ Intro I mean I was I was warned by Luke what those guys were like it wasn't my first time um like like we were we were there we did the uh we we did the Bro versus bro first so I encountered bit of a primer lwig by that point wait did we do the Bro versus bro first yeah I think so now I don't
remember no I think so no we did bro versus bro after really yeah no okay well never mind anyway I I knew who lewig was um and so I was surprised but not shocked I was I was um it was unexpected but not surprising I don't know I don't know how to phrase it but yeah no they did their their intro I think to go back and do the yard again I would probably lean more into their rather than like kind of be the skeptical you know Outsider but maybe that's sort of part of the the deal of you know having a
guest on a show like that um maybe everyone kind of goes through that a little bit I wouldn't know I don't watch the show um I had a couple people that were like very mad about me not knowing who anybody was and not listening to the podcast or watching the show or whatever else cuz I don't know it made me seem arrogant or something um but I was just I was just trying to be honest like I'm I'm so sorry I actually don't know any of your names because we all introduced ourselves like 3 minutes ago before I
walked in here and then I sat at the top of that slide for all of that time while you guys were DJ racist or whatever and so I just was like yeah no I'm sorry the only one of you who I know is is lwig and that just kind of is what it is and I'm sorry um but some people you know took that really negatively but I mean you know how things are um that's actually one of my that's this is one of my favorite sort of yard sticks for um you know how how marketable my faces is how content
performs when I'm on someone else's channel uh because how our videos perform is like this is your house yeah this yeah exact exactly exactly like how how uh how how marketable of a name is is LT so I'm going to do this live but I'm going to go and have a look at like how you don't want to look at anything from like a day ago like a week or two ago um you know how' I do so Geo rain bold pretty uh pretty appealing guest so that that's pretty cool um let's see who are who are some other folks hive mind
TV was apparently uh a pretty good one cuz I don't really like I don't watch YouTube so this is one of the ways that I'll I'll figure out like okay who's like a big deal like this Sea Dog VA guy seems to be kind of a big deal so that's that's pretty cool um rainbolt is is pretty based yeah yeah there you go here's one with just the crew okay "500,000 so that's kind of the high end" of if they don't have a guest on uh what else we got do you you already know the answer to this oh no I
did pretty good yeah 800k did you already know the answer to this I already know what answer to this to what how well you did oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you already knew the answer to this I didn't I haven't looked at it in like I don't know two or 3 months okay but I knew that it was like an above average I was wondering how performative this was no no I just haven't looked at it in a while okay okay okay um yeah so it's uh there's oh yeah Hank Green Hank Green crushed me but makes sense Han green
yeah yeah they had Han green on so it's it's it's one of those things it's like it helps me kind of figure out you know where everyone's stock is at kind of at at whatever time they were they were on another like another uh person's Channel and helps me figure out if like if like I did okay you know like if anyone if anyone cares outside of just our like hyper hyper geek sort of bubble that we  there were there were a couple other cutie Cinderella crushed um I mean that makes sense it's oh yeah 100% makes
sense um she's a great host and she's rather affiliated with that crew rather Affiliated amaranth it's way to say amaranth crushed that makes sense but yeah I was I was actually a little surprised to see how much overlap there was like I wasn't expecting Their audience and our audience to have a lot of overlap that's another thing that it gauges so it's not just like oh higher number on someone else's Channel automatically you're like a big deal in mainstream or whatever
like no um but it can tell you how much overlap there is between people who watch that and people who watch and there's too many variables to draw any concrete conclusions but it's an indicator what's an audience that you don't think you would perform well with because of overlap issues cuz I I feel like you know I I went I went through a few in my head and one that I landed on was like makeup but then no feel like if you went on a makeup Channel we'd probably kill I don't think so actually
I think so because all the dude Bros would be like what I actually bet you it would do pretty all right I don't think so I don't think so um it might do bad for them because their algorithm is going to be all screwed but I feel like the one episode might do I don't know this is a tough one if you have any kind of public space where it's just like a mixing pot like that the fact that that school had the teacher and two students who knew enough to go find this on the subreddit
and like knew who we were and like all that stuff that's like pretty that's pretty solid but that's just mixing pot right whereas like an actual space where people are selectively there because they have an interest like I would think I would think if you if there was a Ceramics Studio that had a channel like and I went on there there'd be like there'd be nothing I feel I might do okay no no one would care I don't think the uh I think you do enough weird random off-the-wall stuff on this
channel that something like Ceramics would do fine but it's it's like a math education channel oh no that would be super high overlap you think ah people who are into math education and people who are into technology get real yeah fair enough they did well on veritasium it's mostly like pretty crazy stuff yeah no I wasn't thinking like that though I was three brown one three brown one or one three one blue brown one blue yeah yeah yeah yeah something like that too to be clear Brown I don't know
whatever to be clear veritasium I I completely ignored that one though and the reason for that no I shouldn't say I ignored it I watched the video and like Derek did and his team did a great job and everything but I I wasn't going to read anything into that one because his video performance is like like so spiky um and which seems weird to me because they all seem quite consistently good you never I mean it's so hard sometimes even a master of YouTube packaging and and and content creation is not going to
knock it out of the park every single time unless your name is Mark Rober even he even he doesn't get the same number of views on every single video because not everything can appeal to absolutely everybody and that's the way it is MH we should work on that yeah I mean we're trying Dan everybody's trying Dan you want be more Normy no no no no I mean uh you need to find the video that appeals to literally every single person sure but then I mean that's like not possible is it yeah
nope okay up next hi dll I'm in my senior year of engineering undergrad in my opinion at best 96 of the 128 credits are relevant to my success how would you pitch higher education to your children and do you have hot takes part of the the original idea of the credit system and getting people to take credits that were not in their actual direct courses was to prepare people for being an adult and needing to like communicate with others about things that aren't just their One
Singular Niche trying to prep you for like the world yeah I don't think it's as relevant these days they forced and stuff like that they forced yvon to take one accounting course as part of her Pharmacy degree thank goodness wo you never know I guess there was classes that annoyed me when I was in school that I have absolutely used like yeah there's even there's even classes that I took back in school that I still would have thought would have been useless two years ago and have since become useful
like I I don't know learning stuff is just good and useful part of it is sta is forcing you to learn to learn yeah and push yourself to learn something that you're not inherently interested in and that you might not see the point of because you never know understand other perspectives and to be less generally useless if you are more generally competent you are less generally useless which is awesome there's life tips right there it's really fantastic man speaking of higher education I was reading this
interesting article about how um College professors are like we don't really know what to do because they assign reading to and they students and they just like don't read like they literally arrive in college going yeah we've been assigned like excerpts to read but we've never been assigned just like read this book yeah and come back in a a couple days when you're done students entering Harvard that have never once read a book that is flipping wild to me yeah I don't know how to deal with that yeah
um yeah y all got to like read like a bit and stuff literally me already  book I mean you got a job without it I  know I've read a book maybe oh I mean that's better than it's parents still read AJ says I've only read eight books my entire life the Harry Potter books plus House of the Scorpion or scorpan sorion I don't know what House of the Scorpion  I read Grapes of Wrath and I really wish I hadn't I genuinely like think like a thousand pages that you should read and
this is even someone who has a hard time with it because I think it's good for your brain to just sit there and have to imagine Art's trolling I've read books but not many in University what about uh I mean are we okay with like Harry Potters and House of the dragon and all those sort of like book A book we don't have to be like you know they don't have to be proper novels kind of har Potter is a proper novel no for young adults I mentioned grap Grapes of of Wrath right which is like a classic a classic
American I've read a book I've read Grapes of Wrath I don't know honestly speaking I think a lot of what makes something classic is that it came first um like quite frankly uh The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and the adventures of Berry Finn kind of suck the coming first part matters though in my opinion and like to be clear they don't suck you know I'm sure they're full of You Know Rich Pro and all those things and stuff going to upset some people but I didn't care like I I read them as a kid and I
was like seriously this this is what qualified as like good kids books those days my God nothing happens um you know so I and and so I I think that um I think that you know just because something is more modern and just because it's full of plot holes and um what no just don't worry about it and and and like flawed World building you know talking about Harry Potter here right now yeah yeah that doesn't make it not valid uh okay what just people are quoting me quoting you I avoided that
one cuz uh the coming first part matters oh my goodness does fanfiction count like like I don't know my immortal and stuff like that it was seriously his name uh yeah I I don't know I think I think the the literal mental exercise of having to create a world in your in your brain to to try to visualize it instead of just watching video and having that done for you in in the modern day is actually very valuable for for flexing your creativity muscles and stuff I promise you nobody has made any video
content that you enjoy watching I'm talking like films TV shows nobody made those without reading yeah like it's it's an important part of being able to create and not just consume I I listen to audiobooks all the time tree hallucination CU I get a lot of benefit from that as well you still have to imagine just listening to it like cuz when you're reading it you are solely focused on the page if you're just listening to it while you're cooking dinner like you're not hallucinating properly now I being a
novel purist I haven't read in years so it's I I think reading is objectively more based than listening to an audio book I just sometimes you know if I'm driving I'm going to listen to an audiobook and I'm still you don't just read behind the wheel just a full like hard cover hard cover and then you have your phone tape at the top of it for Subways first oh nice good good good yeah cuz you can't you shouldn't read without Subway Surfers yeah you should you should you know and I got podcast
one year yeah right good good Cory as the name says there's something to be said for books that break the mold and redefine entire genres of literature they may be weak in comparison to Modern equivalents but those equivalents wouldn't exist if not for the OG and that's fine if you're like a literary historian but I'm just saying for people who just like should practice reading so they can Flex their reading muscle I don't necessarily consider that to be the best use of their time we're not
talking about learning literature weathering Heights also fing sucked I'm sorry it sucks it's not good um I didn't enjoy it I'm sorry um again it's like boring it moves at a glacial pace and it's like and it's a high cognitive load to read it because it uses kind of archaic English and it was not enjoyable I'm sorry and you're not going to get anybody I had this was this was a really good I for I think I overheard this conversation or no it was relayed to me by Ivon and um it came
from one of um uh there's a there's a kid that Ivon and I both know who goes to a like a religious school and basically you can get some really um you can get some really interesting opinions on what kind of literature is okay to read from um from people who have you know their Doctrine and their their belief system and who are Educators and they can kind of uh end up prescribing a really restrictive diet of literary materials and uh I was quite surprised based on what I knew about
this particular teacher from Context um that what they basically said is the best thing for a kid to read is anything that kid will read yeah yep literally anything I don't care it can be witchcraft or Minecraft or Minecraft or did I say Minecraft go to more Minecraft yeah whatever it doesn't matter the point is it can be anything just make sure that they learn to bloody read and so you know yeah I think if you if you if you go and you give kids like um yeah yeah I mean I'll I'll come back
to to my example okay oh here's one I loved the secret world of Aug um by Pierre Burton when I was a kid and I went and I tried to read it to my kids and they just tuned the math out it was the the language was not just maybe at a bit of a high level for what they were ready for at the time so that's was part of the problem but not just that but it was just it was it was written in an older style and and they weren't engaged with it and I could have insisted but what would I have done I would have just
created a negative a negative reading experience why why are we doing this I never liked reading at all um you know I've always had problems with that type of stuff I was really bad at spelling all those types of things my mom was trying to get me into it because it would have benefited me fairly obviously um and I I don't think she had ever read it before but she picked up the Hobbit if I had to make a guess she probably picked up The Hobbit because I liked like video games and Fantasy games um
and she's like well I don't know just try this uh and loved The Hobbit she she read The Hobbit to me and I was super into it and The Hobbit being so good not the movies if you're a young who hasn't read the movies sucked the book was fantastic yeah the movies were just just butt The Hobbit being so good drove me to want to read the Lord of the Rings and that was really hard not just because of age but but it was the story was so good that I really enjoyed that then I got
into the Harry Potter books and then I was started expanding Beyond there and now reading became like a thing for me um and despite it being hard I would take like an entire Saturday and just chill and read because I'm like this is great I love these worlds that I'm disappearing into man I wish I had Saturdays like that as an adult yeah anyway yeah Fox and suggested scps scary stories on the internet does it necessarily have to be a book can it be like fanfiction level stuff can it be I
think it being a book has value because you want someone to yes I think that has value I also think there's something to be said for it maintaining a certain bar of quality consistent voice like Ivon has this app called dream character with an e at the end and basically um it's like independent writers and I think they get a commission from people like buying the next chapter of their stories and stuff like that so like it honestly seems like kind of pretty constructive for that's cool um for like amateur
writers but oh my god um like they're it's just full of like grammatical errors and uh and typos and just like um like you'll just you'll it's written by people whove never read so you'll it'll be full of like homonyms that are just like you read it out loud and the sentence makes sense but it's just like it's just wrong I think there's I think there's something to be said for I'm not saying that language isn't evolving and shouldn't evolve it absolutely does and it absolutely should
but um you know in the same way that you don't get to take artistic license with a painting until you like understand fundamentally how to paint you can't really take artistic license with language until you understand the basic structures and know how to use them um and in a lot of cases um you know you you get carelessness describ or disguised as um creativity and I um I think there's some value to um consuming content that has  this is what are you writing fan fictions in the CH Dan this is like the
most classic most famous one is this a copy pasta no this is a a like a massive fanfiction uh based on Harry Potter and uh My Immortal is known very far and wide for being a work of non I'm not going to lie I thought it was a joke no I've never read that before this makes it a lot better because it is actually stupid unfortunately sincere it's like a the room kind of situation um my name is Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven way and I have long ebony black hair that's how I got my name with
purple streaks and red tips that reaches my midback and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee and if you don't know who she is get the hell out of here get the hell out of here there's a lot of author your name from your long ebony black hair yeah that doesn't really work out because you were a baby you didn't have that you're an actual  yeah internet historian apparently did a read of it okay phenomenal video yeah this is that's probably the best way to
consume uh My Immortal okay it sounds like you're probably I was not expecting that to happen tonight I am so sorry the  oh boy uh Lake lonus Dune I'm working towards my doctorate in philosophy aiming to work in Tech do you think my time would be better spent in research and development or policy around implementation also second role for SC hoodie probably no more SC hoodie we do have a hoodie based on that pattern coming soon you might like it um as for what you should be working on I mean
policy around implementation seems like something someone with philosophy training should probably be working on with all this AI stuff going on but whether anyone's actually willing to pay you to do that when they'd rather just go in like a wrecking ball um I don't know good luck though and I hope you can make a positive difference in the world there are actually companies hiring that role good well they should yeah a lot of them are doing but then they should actually listen instead of just hiring
the role and so that a lot of them are doing it in order to try to improve their lobbying efforts oh good yeah cool well carry on hi I work in Tech retail and we get a lot of clients looking for the cheap systems not understanding or wanting to understand that they won't get the functionality they want how do I explain it you won't be able to explain it the way to handle it is be enthusiastic and be excited about the things that you know are going to actually make them happy take time to
ask questions it sounds like you're doing that though like you've taken the time to understand what they want the fun thereafter um and so so you just have to improve your salesmanship be excited about the things that will work be extremely unexcited about the things that won't work warn them tell them you don't want them to waste their money because buying something twice even if it's only 2third of the price costs more than buying something once that actually works and actually fulfills their needs
um so you just have to kind of try to try to break it down and um and do your best every once in a while someone's going to come in they're going to have some kind of expectations and what you got to do is you got to say look um this isn't going to work for you but it's uh clear that it's what you want and you can give it a try here's our return policy and uh if you come back in I'd be happy to um you know chat with you and help you find something that works out better for you but maybe you'll try it
and you know maybe from our conversation I've misunderstood exactly what it is that your expectations are and it'll work just fine for you just leave the  and let's see here last one I've got LTT number one Precision bits and PTM 7950 when I don't know Logistics are a challenge I saw someone uh in float plane chat earlier saying PTM 7950 it should be in stock I mean surely there couldn't be a shortage from Honeywell or whatever but it's Marvel logistics thing uh we were really
working on trimming down our stock on the store and I think we kind of overs swung the pendulum that way too enthusiastic need to do a better job of just maintaining a little bit more uh stock of just the the the Run rate items that uh that people are that people are after like um tall shirts like tall shirts yeah I are they all like out of stock the tall shirts the smalls are in yeah we have small and we have nothing else for long sleeve you have a few options um for short sleeve it's only small I have
been tracking this often the microfiber shirt sold out so I think we got the order quantity about right on that one but uh yeah we'll uh we're we're going to we're going to we're going to keep getting better at it I think I hope we'll keep trying yeah and I think that's it we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel
