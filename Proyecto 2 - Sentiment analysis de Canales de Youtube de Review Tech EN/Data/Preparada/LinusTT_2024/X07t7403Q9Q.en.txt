okay we're not actually related and I'm pretty sure I'm older than him but hanging out with Lucas makes me feel like the little brother and we can't "start his AMD $5,000 ultimate Tech" upgrade until we can find some way to get us both in the freaking shot maybe this will work Lucas works hard on power supplies testing for the lab and we can't shoot the whole video like this cut we can't make him shorter so we're going to have to make me taller these are wow these are some incredible 
that Ah that's more like it I have never used these before what could go wrong okay hey that's better anyway like I was saying Lucas works on power supply circuit and power supply reviews on LTT labs.com I can't believe it's taking so long for an LT "Labs member to get a $5,000 ultimate" Tech upgrade from our sponsor AMD but here we are both high as and ready to get to work get it it's a it's a I got there you're like not even that much taller before we get to the upgrade as 
a all right I think we're going to have to lose the stilts  if it's AMD upgrade time then it must also be AMD sweep Stakes time you could win one of three am5 upgrade bundles featuring the fastest gaming CPU on the market the AMD ryzen 79800 x3d along with an Asus motherboard and 32 gigs of ddr5 RAM check out the link in the description for your chance to win I think we're just going to have to live with this anyway to be honest given what a minimalist you are I don't think we're
going to find that much stuff from the office here we don't even have the decency to steal an LTT store water bottle no aha I paid for that one you think it was probably comped there's no way you bought this dbrand Rubik's Cube probably used the gift from dbrand a gift from dbrand really there's no way you bought an Apple polishing cloth it was a gift from who from my brother really yeah was your brother meing no no oh this is going to be a problem if I have to kneel to look at something you're not going to
anyway the point is this computer is definitely pilfered Christmas party that's what they all say and these dbrand dark plates another gift from dbrand GI from dbrand I guess this explains how debrand always knows what I'm up to my entire staff is moles and I don't think I'm going to find anything else in here like literally anything else it feels like we're bringing more stuff in here than there already was was is minimalism a lifestyle is it I don't like clutter I don't know can you
explain the random sheet of cardboard under your bed that I only know about because I went and put my backpack in there it's where I throw all the Clutter so the cardboard is like a floor protector I think it's protective yeah and the LED strip around the cardboard it looks cool that's a Vibe got it when  cardboard admittedly that is true they do look pretty cool yeah I programmed them myself for this r random rainbow star pattern one piece of clutter though that it's just
breadboarded nice actually there is one more notable piece of clutter uh what's going on with this right now I to buy a car I can't bike very much so you know maybe a new television will make you feel better can watch them tour to France cool let's have a look all right there's the back of the TV so normally we're upgrading some 's TV but now you just like have a TV now was not having a TV before part of the minimalism thing or just laziness I guess I don't know huh got a good screen on my laptop
it's funny because if I hadn't immediately moved out with Yvonne other than probably being like messier than this this is probably what my place would have been like like when we first moved into our house even with Ivonne and her desire for you know Furniture and Things uh we just had a mattress on the floor like we didn't even have a bed frame to start with like you at least have a bed got you there yeah yeah nice thank you let's put the stand on and maybe while we do that you can tell me
why you chose the LG C3 uh it's one of the top three or four oleds they just released a C4 but I think it's only a bit brighter and not too much else yeah I think it will be pretty good especially given you're upgrading from zero laptop yeah yeah I feel like this is going to be one of those videos where like half the comments are like Linus's company doesn't pay enough because luas can't own anything okay where does it go you don't by any chance have a TV stand do you in a box yeah in two boxes oh really
I assumed like your level of minimalism it was just going to like I'm also taller so that might work for some is this couch new or did you like have a couch uh my mom insisted on it when she came over for my surgery you did not own a couch until your mom came to visit you no yeah that cardboard is from the coach so before we do the furniture we've got to clean the floor I noticed two things actually first I noticed that your place is immaculately clean like like too clean like you have
picture hangers on the wall but no pictures on them like it's weird so then why do you need this then it looked really fancy I I don't know very tempy to but get the best of everything so it's not a great value no no how much was this it's like a th000 Canadian I know well I think the fancy thing about this is there's a laser in the head here so a what a laser so it shows like dust or something what there's a picture on the box I think reveals invisible dust you didn't even know it was
dirty if you don't know like does it matter you can feel it you can tell that looks like trash that looks nothing like the picture on the box that's not a laser turn off the lights well no I just mean it's all on the one side like what's their where's their diffusion layer it's that does I mean yeah but I could see that already oh just there's no dust here dude there is no dust on your floor this place is like borderline neurotically clean like you know that right thanks comes with a wall mount though
are you are you okay mounting anything on the wall like I couldn't help noticing the previous tenant had pictures um you were like yeah the hangers are okay I guess but that's the most I can handle don't like leaving a Mark I don't know but there's already a mark Mar you you could you could put something on it I was thinking about hanging my Lego map but it's very heavy and probably wouldn't be supported by those Lucas you keep this place so tidy I think they'd probably be okay if you
put like a drywall anchor in the wall look at the anxiety here this is hilarious I'm about to break his brain if you don't wall mount it it will go on the floor and it would be clutter I'll tell you what Lucas as my gift to you when I go to Home Depot to get some drywall anchors I will bring back a little bit of spackle would that would that satisfy you sounds good okay decide where you're wall mounting it I also I don't know if it's in the closet I don't know if there's power in
there probably do you want to figure it out I got you wait wait there really got to watch out for this this is a flip dot display or it's like electromechanical no way yeah it's electromechanical display it's made of of these tiny uh discs and they have a little magnet in them and then underneath there's coils of wire and you uh they flip them back and forth using you know by running current through the C of wire so what are you going to use it for is it a clock is it a expression of your not
decided yet minimalism maybe you'll just have it all white yeah uh maybe build a frame for it or get more of them and put them all together but they're quite expensive so right what's one of these  $700 oh no I left a mark on the floor when I was sliding the table it's really bad I'm not  acting his mama didn't raise no fool she just raised someone who doesn't think couches are necessary there isn't like a regular outlet there's just power for the washing machine so nope it's going 
him under the bed no you can't put it under the bed I think probably this corner would work I want to see see him put a hole in something I just I don't know there's like kind of like a weird almost perverse like desire to just like watch him violate his wall I have a broken uh hand thing so oh like yeah I guess it's it's a it's a lot I can't even play badminton so sorry what were you saying about your deposit and holes in the wall I'll just  deposit all right  up we're charging this could be a short
extension for you you wanted it longer right so I mean there look now you have an extension so let's see okay how far can you reach now oh God a lot of articulation what happened as you get  well and as promised here's your putty knife and spackle for when you're going to need this later I'll throw it under the bed for you oh great thanks now why don't we talk about your Soundbar I guess you um missed the video we did on how you can build a full 5.1 surround setup off Facebook Marketplace
for a fraction of the cost of a soundbar yeah that one came up a bit too late for me to make some choices I also feel like it really wouldn't have been your style no I do like this one you know it's nice compact I'm not too much of a sound guy I don't like you know loud noises so plus I think it's like like homekit compatible and all that stuff so that's  other ultimate contrast now your whole thing is like you know evaluating Power Products so surge protectors actually necessary
Placebo um they will probably have components in there it's hard to say about each individual one um but yeah they will have you know surge mitigating components in there so good to have this is something that drives me crazy every TV manufacturer must know that you're going to have a soundar under it and yet none of them leave a spot to rut the cable for it if I designed products they would be different speaking of Designing products do we have any other the power bar mounting things yeah oh yeah yeah
yeah we do let's go magnetic Cable Management oh wow oh this is  sweds while Jordan finishes cable managing the TV I was thinking Lucas you and I could work on your new gaming system great why do you even need a new system you just got that computer last year it's very large um yeah you wouldn't have any space to put something as big as that computer all these new additions you know got to make some room okay well what' you go for 7800 x3d obvious choice obviously a little bit um early to make
the decision for the new 9800 also they're completely out of stock everywhere because people keep buying them way to go people and then a small more case power supply obviously we have a review for this one on the LTG Labs website oh and so this one's good that's a good one yeah good choice all right thank you I mean you can believe him out of literally everyone who works here he's the one who knows what else we got here 32 gigs of gskill memory ddr5 6000 cl30 it's pretty much your sweet spot
for am5 right now so you're carrying over your GPU from your old system from the existing one yes now you have a pretty mid-range GPU in there and this raised some questions for me uh exactly what games are you playing such that you need a 7800x 3D second fastest gaming ship on the planet basically but you like don't need a GPU I play mostly rocket League um and oh that happens to be a game that like runs pretty good on yes thank you uh but a lot of this a lot of decisions were um
Health by John at the labs as well he knows a lot about computers so are you building the computer do you build computers or do you just test power SP I've never built a computer now well there's no time like the present I'm excited yeah let's do it and by let's I mean you great single monitor extra tall TK Mount nice uh Hey Reese are you looking for something to do do you want to build this oh no what what are you building um a blue thing a blue thing for the bike is it a stand it's a stand
yeah like a repair stand cool oh so you are going to fix it we hope well I'll have another bike eventually oh is that one not fixable no it's a write off oh the frames bent like skewed so you're getting distracted you're supposed to be building the computer though right he's he's avoiding it he's worried you guys will judge him you wouldn't do that would you this is better framing for the two of us than if you stand so yep nicely featured board got pcie Gen 5 for both m.2 and pcie by 16 slot so you'll be
ready for future GPU upgrades got front USB support um got a couple m.2 slots yeah carry on don't let me get in the way do I remove that what you do is you lift it up without removing that okay so just remember you damage those pins it's game over no pressure though arrows oh yeah now you have to do it again for the closeup M yeah doing doing things for the first CPU install let's go oh wow fun fact this breaks sherrod's law of memory installation alignment oh no no that's right no no you were
right the first time never mind yep no this follows shad's law shad's law states that you don't have to look at the key on the memory module you just look at the location of the sticker and the most cosmetically appealing side is usually facing away from the CPU socket it's one of those things if where if you're not computer sexual I don't blame you for not knowing which side of a memory module is the more attractive one right memory's in do you remember what's next I think it would be to either
insult in the case or I think we have to dismantled my previous computer to oh yeah you have no storage some of the stuff yeah cool point of that one all right let's do it I couldn't help noticing something over here by the way you have a PC but you actually go out of your way to use an Apple keyboard wait you use time machine hold on a second where oh there's your MacBook this isn't even on do you even use this thing I use it for Rocket League uh that's about it this is the part I'm the
expert at you unplugging PCI nice power yeah I guess you do that a lot probably hundreds of computer is worth he's in his comfort zone right now folks well now he's out of it is that the wrong one I mean you'll have to remove that one eventually but not now it's a lot yeah it's a lot harder when that other one is in the way of it there you go every time I see a post on Reddit or on the form or whatever it's like building communities is like easy it's just Lego for adults it's like you I
think you're taking for granted all the things that you have experienced before like I think if you put a Lego kit in front of someone with no instructions yeah yeah building a computer's a belat like that for people who haven't done it before and there's like a 100 different mechanisms for the PCI retention like is this actually holding in I can't even see I think it's just brace yeah it is oh is it like bolt in or just brace you tell me I actually really like that I didn't know that main gear used braces
like that to hold their gpus in place but that's wicked smart oh my goodness that's just ludicrous okay is this like standing desk but you're too cheap to get a standing desk or like what human right   like okay I think it might actually be too tall even for you yeah I was planning on using two bars so you can buy in one bar or three bar I have the one bar uh I probably need a two bar I will take out a bar okay yeah let's take out a bar uh we're almost done the uh bike stand or whatever this thing is it
is a bike stand right this thing it's a stand yeah like a repair stand listening I'm going to assume it's a bike stand it's kind of like the Snap-on of bike tools oh really so this was like a hey thanks AMD I wouldn't pay for this myself kind of purchase yeah but it's you know nice and sturdy and blue so like like how much weight can it support like I'm not done here I'm not done here yet you're getting distracted again right just reusing your old solid Drive uh we've got a phantom Spirit that's
going into Lucas's machine this is going to be more than enough to keep that 7800 X 3D cool I think I was told for clearance reasons that I need these for clearance reasons like to the case for the I'm not sure see there's all the wiring that we need to build a functioning computer and then you basically double or triple it if you want to put any RGB in it and you I'm fine with RGB oh so we're just not going to hook it up just run it black yeah I you see it any we're not going to
be here all day hey look at that Reese's done the bicycle stand why are you tightening it up so much it's like you know that I'm going to try to hang off it absolutely oh yeah we could put a bike on it okay so now you can without like breaking your pore back is this a fancy bike or is this like this is like a mid tier not that fancy okay so no carbon fiber but no no yeah aluminum it's it's hard to find a really big bike I was say yeah slim pickings right you  yeah I want maybe like a bit lower okay
first of all my feet are dangling off the floor unless I point my toes that chair's too short for Meo yeah okay and second of all my eyes are at about this height um for proper ergonomics your eyes should be at about this point in the top of the screen so uh I'll just  posture well he's going to have to throw it away then doesn't fit Jordan says that I have to talk about the tech it holds lots of stuff okay you can get our Precision screwdriver in there I keep some side
Cutters and a pair of pliers I also keep like a pile of our screwdrivers in here and the reason that I do that is cuz they're all color coded for the different loadouts I have for them this is my standard bit set this is my Imperial hex this is my metric hex and then this one is my specialty so I got my tri wings uh got all that kind of stuff in there LTT store.com okay sorry what do you need I was sure how tight to make the old oh just go until they don't go anymore it was
clicking yeah that's fine that's good it's a good click I think fans next yeah let's do fans this is legit one of the hardest upgrades of because this I know we were meing it for the intro but also like acknowledging that it was going to be a real problem look how far bent over he is the same posture you guys just watch he's going to be a wizard with the power supply cables he's going to plug those things in so fast so flawlessly give me that power supply let's go so that goes in the case now how are
you doing Jordan good we have a lovely rug for us here to go in oh we got a rug beautiful where did the rug come from seems cheap Home Depot I think I don't know Home Depot nice Jonathan y jonan Jonathan yeah designer I can just see it your mom's going to come in next time she's visit she's going to be like my goodness is that a Jonathan AG let's go rean Jordan can you guys um can you guys help Lucas out here yeah I don't even know where I want it you just focus on mounting this power supply you
let you let reys he's got an interior design background he's got you covered uh no okay sure expert you can put anything on your resume that's true I did okay so did you guys find the the Lego stuff little little guys right here cool how you doing over here wow good progress thank you power suppli is in there look at that you even got one modular cable plugged into it you're tall Luc I want is it not I don't know you not like it I was entrusted with the power so I'm using my power and you just have to
trust Reese trust the process or don't that's totally fine sure that's that's he didn't seem very confident there that was a pretty pregnant pause there do you want to give us some thought do you want it over there I don't know what do you guys think no yes I told you what I think let's put it there it sounds good Beauty good enough for me you can tell from his tone of voice he's super happy with this decision yeah we should plug in some power cables and stuff first let's see
if you can figure out how to plug in the power he doesn't have to work with me day to day so this is probably his highest dose of me like ever I can't even get this thing oh that's funny after all after all my uh ribbing you you actually like can't plug in the power supply for testing it's all in a really flat bored so it's really nice and easy holy don't look don't look don't look we're not there yet Lucas you're looking they told you not to look we specifically said they said not to
watch don't look well you don't know can't hurt you yeah the tweedles over there are really uh TW kind of hard to look away from right now my mom always used to do that she'd refer to two of us as Tweedle D and Tweedle Dum and she'd never specify which one of us was dumb in that moment um it was usually mebody brightens the place up yeah what do you think it's good it's nice looks level thank you there was very little confidence in this is going to be one of the most transformative Transformations I think
because we really did start with a very BL slate I got you this Ultimate Upgrade oh thank you wow I can put this somewhere else down yeah I just don't understand how they're supposed to hold this in like you see what I mean here right like what how am I supposed to where the devil am I supposed to put this thing you know okay I'm just going to find a couple spots where it kind of lines up and just go for it seems to be the theme today what are you saying about the fine
work they did mounting that Lego art on the wall okay well I'm sorry this is the best I can do you're just going to have a bundle of cables hanging here above your fans there go the standards well yeah well yeah you told me not to bother hooking up the RGB anyway didn't you that's what I spent this whole time doing I totally for God I just it's a reflex I just see cables I hook them up I don't think woo see but now that you've got the RGB right no regrets right how could I ever turn
those off yeah exactly there she goes nice all right perfect well that's great news you're going to get so many more FPS in rocket League M okay let's uh let's continue where hey where do you want this uh that's just been living on my desk that actually have I have had for a little while um probably going to to stay there for now until I can build a frame of sort or oh something for it okay how do you want to log in uh yeah I guess you'll need a keyboard oh you got oh we got a new mouse and keyboard oh
wow that is a really good thing these are the these are from IB power those are the free ones from Samy's um PC where that he bought Christmas party yeah they're awful yeah yeah okay there you go well I mean you know they're just worth $10 or something well this is an upgrade Kyron K2 H Wireless magnetic switch keyboard kind of shows us kind of you know just winging it really well you know I like the Apple chicklet keyboard so right so basically we ignore any of your taste and keyboards anyway probably 
okay I mean that sounds a little better than the Apple keyboard didn't it I think it sounds nice yeah I like the Apple keyboard doesn't make any sound at all but okay what' you go with for Mouse uh Razer death UT V3 Pro all right I mean realistically you play rocket League so like yeah well it could Branch out I'm not sure wait you use a controller don't you for right yeah for good going say if you're playing rocket league with keyboard and mouse you're do it wrong wow yeah no that does look good looks
clean do you not have a mouse pad no Lucas I got a table what I don't even have one at work any either you but Lucas I grant you my on camera permission to steal a mouse pad work he's not going to do it even is he cuz he could have one at his workstation for nothing but I think I have one in my closet there's one in the closet yeah okay well let's go get the mouse pad no no we need the mouse pad wait you totally have like one of the really nice designer Edition LTD mouse pads
great can't wait to use it okay there see oh look how much nicer that is see does that not feel better on the most  thanks not minimalist the accident come on that can't be the reason we really are a fascinating group of people what are you trying to say yeah I'm trying to say that I I get it Lucas I see you that's what I'm trying to say I don't I don't know if I'm minimalist or anything but you know I just like things clean and organized a bit you know brother you didn't have a
couch till your mother made you buy one this would be a fun wow discussion topic who out of everyone who's gotten an upgrade so far has had the most serial killer Abode be really interested to see the audience debate it see Lucas would have nowhere to stash a body right like nowhere to hide it so under the bed maybe one of his CL yeah dude are you seeing this that is so cool I was just sitting here and it was all like hey look I'm upside down that is  go so cool whoa no way okay what are we
looking at is this what is this this is just random patterns of noise like call it pearlin noise it's a mathematical way to do got like cloud formations or stuff like this okay but it's just very mesmerizing little cat it's a little loud hey it can be loud yeah depends like where you put it and stuff it's if you're just in like a quiet space like this it's kind of loud could you like mount it behind like a double pain glass thing or something you could hide glass or something
yeah oh no way that is so cool I just have a bunch of like demos basically all right you ready to show us your rocket League skills that's pretty cool okay well you're definitely better than me already you could remember the controls without having to LIF them up so that's uh that's a step my son and his friends do stuff in this game that I'm just like yeah I'm sure there are like nine-year-olds that are like incredibly better than me it fat boy the Riz God gotcha have you tried being more
of a Riz God cuz then yeah you might beat him okay casual like 400 FPS I can see why you don't play on the PlayStation yeah yeah well also Ultra wide the PlayStation can't even even do that I think Playstation still can't do that not one I used to play like a year ago at least really yeah I don't think so I don't think so how do they there's so many Ultra wide displays these days though Ultra wide monitors no's the T TV thing yeah you put on TV like a ple it's ironic because so much movie content is
ultra wide you think they would just have Ultra wide TVs it's yeah hey TV manufacturers wake up where's like Ultra wide TVs you guys are looking for some excuse to charge a premium in the space right bring out nobody wants a rolling TV bring whyde cinematic TV huh you're  what you you still watch go is the Apple TV part of the upgrade or no uh I kind of already owned that but it wasn't set up before wait yeah what did you even hook it up to you didn't have a TV nothing it was in a box in a box so it
was just Apple no TV this will be my first time hearing the beam V2 I heard good things about the original beam there's definitely frequencies that struggles with battle you have given us hope man that TV looks good though got a surprising amount of Rumble for uh not having a sub it's got a little bit Yeah I think you can buy like additional like add-ons like Bluetooth right yep so yeah you can get a sub and you can actually get surrounds as well which if you wanted a bit more
of a like immersive sound that would help but it seems like you don't care you probably have to wall out him are we really going to keep this rug like this I don't know probably not yeah we'll see how see how it goes okay cool May I'll move the  closer once we leave and stop criticizing him but with that said I don't actually think there's too much to criticize I thought this was a super practical upgrade laser focus PC upgrade adding that 7800 X 3D getting like 400 frames
per second in rocket League where every Competitive Edge counts we've got a really nice upgrade to your bike stand the bike is needs some work yeah yeah CBD but dude you went from zero to actually a pretty sick movie watching spot so you're going to start with Lord of the Rings yeah yeah and then uh Breakfast Club yeah that sounds good I was ranting about it at lunch no I don't want to watch it again overrated movie I finally watched Breakfast Club last night it was an absolute piece of
garbage literally nothing happens nobody learns anything oh no I'm going to get I'm going to get a talked on the internet um if you enjoyed this video hey shout out "AMD for sponsor ing the $5,000 AMD" ultimate Tech upgrade series if you guys are looking for another video to watch why don't you go check out Matthews I was going to throw to someone else from the lab team but you're the first one to win one
