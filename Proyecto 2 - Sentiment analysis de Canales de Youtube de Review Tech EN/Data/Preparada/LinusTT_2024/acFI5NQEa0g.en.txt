jarmo asks what PC components to cut corners on if your budget is limited and the answer to this one is really obvious your case I see people spending over $100 on a case for a system that's like "$800 $900 $1,000 the ATX standard hasn't" changed in 30 years while you might have to drill some speed holes into it you can use basically any case with enough creativity and uh elbow grease another one that I would say you can cut corners on is cooling just use a stock cooler
it's the kind of thing that sure you're not going to necessarily run at the maximum turbo speeds and it might be a little bit loud today but you can always save up and replace it later whereas if you replace something like a motherboard or CPU or GPU you are not going to get back what you spent when you sell it so you're going to lose a lot in that transaction on the upgrade this video is sponsored by nexo you can check out their gripon case at the link in the video description
