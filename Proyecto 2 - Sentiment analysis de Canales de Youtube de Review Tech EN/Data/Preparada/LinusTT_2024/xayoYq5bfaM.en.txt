reports suggest that nvidia's 590 Mega do will be up to 25% faster dude this is what I've been waiting for why are you waiting you could buy like a sick gaming rig right now for just a g yeah that's so last gen this is going to be worth the wait in other news tariffs on electronics that are manufactured outside of the United States so almost all of them are expected to result in major price hikes oh no what now what am I going to do should I build a computer now or should I wait for NextGen that's
a great question viewer yes you and it's one we see all the time especially around big CPU or GPU launches and while the answer would normally be to plan a manageable budget for yourself and upgrade whenever your current system is no longer meeting your needs with those potential tariffs inbound things could get a little more complicated especially for our American friends but there is some good news because believe it or not this isn't the first time that we run into this type of consumer taxation so
we only need to look at the recent past to understand how tariffs could impact our purchases be they on PC parts washing machines or even merch on LTT store I hope things don't go down this path I want a 50 Series GPU but if this new tax comes into effect now could be a really Savvy time to buy a PC rather than waiting let's break it down and break down this segue to our sponsor War Thunder if you're into vehicle combat games War Thunder is super comprehensive easy to get into and available on PC
consoles and mobile devices play for  description reason number one to pull the trigger now is you know what you're getting as cliche as it sounds until there are third party reviews we don't really know what's coming down the pipe sometimes the pre-launch rumors end up being pretty accurate but other times they aren't and it can be a pretty poopy feeling to wait sometimes months for a pot at the end of the rainbow that turns out to be Fool's Gold number two it's Q4 baby T the season for inventory
management and as we outlined in our holiday buyer guide you can pick up a machine that will handle any AAA game out there for less than you'd probably think and in our recent review of the AMD ryzen 9800 X 3D we found that even an older am4 and ddr4 system is still very capable of modern gaming and can save you a ton of money money that can be spent on a better GPU for enhanced visuals and guys I know what you're going to say buying an older CPU platform can limit your future upgrades
but look at this we asked our staff here what parts they usually upgrade before they just give in and get a whole new platform and while 40% said GPU the cold hard truth is that most people don't won't upgrade their CPUs which leads us to reason number three how often do you really need to upgrade your PC even our team of very techy gamery folks seems to be on about a 2 to threee cycle just enough time to buy now and hopefully wait out the future tariff storm ah yes the dreaded t-word to find out more
about tariffs and how they might impact pricing I asked Elijah who wrote this video to ask Taran who has a friend who worked in the PC hardware supply chain last time a US Administration peaked at uh Brazil's homework and thought hm that seems like a good idea he explained it to me by laying out two different scenarios imagine I'm Walmart I'm buying a 590 at a bulk price of $100 and I'm going to sell them for $125 I make a tidy profit and you get your GPU that's scenario one without any
tariffs now for scenario 2 let's say a flat 50% tariff is applied to a country where I purchased the GPU from I reach out to order some more and there's a extra little line on my invoice 50% of the value of what my order was now I couldn't sell it for 125 even if I wanted to I'd be losing money so to keep my profit I need to sell them for $175 but now my shareholders are upset because they see my gross margins shrink from 25% to 177% okay let's go with 18750 that looks terrible on a price tag
$189.99 now last time around the electronics tariffs were mostly targeting goods manufactured in China which then resulted in manufacturers investing in factories outside of China so that they could avoid them but there's a little hidden cost to the consumers there as well let's say I'm foxcon now different hat I drop a quarter of a bill to build a new Factory in Vietnam there's no Chinese tariffs there but someone still has to foot the bill I know I'll just charge $125 for
that GPU now it's less than a150 so I'm still competitive in the market and in no time at all consumers will get used to paying more for the same product more gravy for me baby obviously that's an oversimplification but there also are examples of times when it's played out just like this the prear RTX 3080 for instance launched for $700 and had a die area so the size of the actual silicon chip of 628 mm the post tariff RTX 480 launched for $200 and has a die area of just 379 mm
now some of this price increase can be traced back to external factors like higher wafer costs for more advanced manufacturing process nodes not to mention the global inflation that is taken place over the last half a decade but a big part of it is just plain charging More For Less now that they've figured out consumers are willing to pay and this time around it could be worse because so many companies Diversified their manufacturing out of China last time around there's a lot of Talk
Amongst American policy makers about implementing import tariffs rather than just limiting the tariffs to the exports of a particular country that will result in manufacturers billing out for both their Investments that they've made to diversify their manufacturing and the tariffs that are being surrendered to the US government and it's not like the retailer is going to get caught holding the bag they're just going to mark up accordingly and if sales volumes decline they'll simply order less so now the GPU
from our example that used to cost $125 at the till is $235 and guess who paid for it you on Monday November 25th president-elect Trump announced a 25% tariff on all Goods coming from Canada as well we'll have to see if they actually follow through with that but based on that announcement our red white and blue friends are going to want to order your LT merch right now need a new screwdriver want to level up your cable management well now is the perfect time to grab great deals during cyber weekend
on LT store shop all of our Black Friday and Cyber Monday specials at lmg gblack Friday now look I'm not even going to bother reading comments on this video because I'm sure that some folks are going to accuse me of getting political but math is not political math is math and as heartless as it sounds the math says that our standard of living in the western world is enabled by unfettered access to cheap overseas labor and if you think that moving manufacturing back is going to solve inflation or even
happen at all I have some hard truths for you one is that Americans don't want a lot of these jobs tsmc for example has had a heck of a Time hiring for their Arizona semiconductor Fab and for some pretty good reasons one of the most obvious ones is the misaligned expectations of work life balance Now American workers rights are far from perfect but what they are is world's better than what you might find elsewhere around the globe Americans rightly expect things like limited shift
times mandated vacations the right to collective bargaining etc etc another less obvious reason is the eroded pipeline of qualified applicant it takes decades to resolve the chicken egg dilemma and develop the steady stream of both new talent and new jobs that makes an entire industry tick it's one of the reasons that our Labs team has struggled so much to hire subject matter experts like if we were in South Korea for instance and we wanted to hire a display expert we would be tripping over
applicants here not so much and it isn't just us ratings for instance has had a job posting up for a display person for ages hard truth number two Americans don't generally want to pay for americanmade products there are exceptions many many exceptions All-American clothing even has this handy dandy list of companies who make their products in America many of which are crushing it I'm personally partial to my onshore manufactured Darn Tough socks from Vermont but that doesn't
change that the overwhelming trend is toward Bargain Basement overseas marketplaces with tenu surpassing shopping apps from giants like Amazon and Walmart earlier this year and more and more I see an attitude of if it costs a few dollars more it's a complete scam a sentiment that actually makes a ton of sense given the ongoing economic challenges that have ballooned our cost of living since realistically the 1980s hard truth number three maybe the hardest one of all is that even if
Americans wanted these jobs and were willing to pay a premium for goods that were manufactured by their friends and neighbors they don't have enough neighbors us unemployment is sitting at about 4% it's not exactly a historic low and has been creeping up but it is well below the last sustained high that we saw during the 2008 financial crisis and it's not that far above the deepest historic lows of about 2.5% so I don't know maybe there's a scenario where folks want to make career
moves into manufacturing roles but what I suspect is that most don't ask yourself would I rather do this all day don't forget it's for minimum wage or less so that's the math there is a political conversation to be had here something around the Deep societal change that would need to take place in order to significantly alter the math but that that's not something I'm going to touch on so let's come back to should you buy a PC right now well based on the rhetoric we're seeing so far might not
be a bad idea the RTX 590 was already rumored to hit the market at around "2,000 Freedom bucks if the proposed" tariffs go through that could jump to more like 2500 for parts that are manufactured outside of China and maybe even more for anything that's manufactured within China now Nvidia May absorb some of this in their margins you know as a favor to Gamers but they also might not and you could build a pretty nice I don't know entire gaming machine for that much money right now another X
Factor is do you guys remember the last time I made a video called buy a PC right now that was right on the eve of a crypto boom that drove GPU prices into the stratosphere for years well guess what's booming again right now look if you don't have the money at the moment or you want to hold out for NextGen don't worry too much this all might end up being a nothing Burger but if you were waiting for the right moment to strike electronics are pretty affordable out there right now and I expect that
