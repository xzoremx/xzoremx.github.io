after how much work it was to install the world's largest TV in my theater room I never thought that less than a year later I'd be replacing it Oh no I got I got I got um especially with something that is technically smaller if you can believe that oh okay she's down she's down she's good I just want to do the traditional Ivon for scale am I an average sized person I don't know somewhere in the world But Here we are now I think it's time old friend you know we've had some
really good times over the last year but the truth is I found someone new someone brighter Slimmer younger someone with double the number of local dimming zones L is please I'm still sexy I know TV but  well with that out of the way let's get to work installing the new one with some help from our sponsor next weo their anniversary sale is on right now and you can get the Aurora Pro projector plus a 100in frenel screen all in a massively discounted bundle check it out at the
link in the description today where are you taking this I am not sure yet are we putting in the theater room are you putting it right here here's the thing it's 5 in diagonally smaller than what I already have and when it comes to immersion size isn't everything but as we discussed recently in that video on the 98 in TCL it's a lot it's a lot there's the sheer volume of light thrown there's the immersiveness however on paper this thing is so much better than the old TV that losing 5 in
could be worth it so how about this we unbox it on the carpet here we have a look at it we have a look at that and we decide if it's worth moving I don't want to move it out of the box but okay maybe they thought of that maybe like TCL they have carry handles included is that for your TV screws into the side and you carry it you can do other things with it too you want you yeah well it's not a flared base so be careful with it why does everyone who works here know that
with a normal TV you would lift the Box off the top but ceilings are a thing so I think the way this is going to go is it's just going to kind of oh my God this is terrifying this is oh that's scary attention accessories above dude you could build a house out of this kind of cardboard look at this keep it for your cats you're doing okay with that box over there yeah I'm just trying to move it should we get these big thick cardboard pieces off first then um I'm feeling like they've got attention
accessories above there because they kind of want you to take the foam off yeah okay just a Vibe I'm getting a Vibe here's another improvement over the TCL it actually comes with mounting feet that one is wall mount only out of the box dude this thing's as dangerous as that gun like oh hey look he found instructions yeah you know it might just fit on your current cabinet there dude it's this close to the ceiling already we haven't even put it on a thing yet I think it's too wide anyway look at this
it shows four people there we don't have four people no we don't cool I don't know what it is but with these giant TVs I kind of expect them to come with a bigger remote pretty big remote that's true pretty okay selection of included buttons I don't mind anything but tuby who watches tuby what are those look are these little IO covers or something yeah okay well we'll put those aside for now it looks like it does allegedly come with some kind of handle and the TV   5 lb foot man Even This foam like has
substance to it you know these ones come off next yeah I took one from the other side already and then it looks like we got to take the side cardboard off all right that was easy woo I mean anything this big is going to have a little bit of flex but uh it's a little scary here's the front energy guide energy cost off the charts though In fairness the comparison range is TVs that are 69 1 12 in or greater so I think high sense is probably doing all right hey the handles are integrated o
how handy is that wow this does not feel as solid as the TCL one maybe tighten since we're back here we can talk about the audio Yeah 4.2.2 two subwoofers dang though just like we mentioned with the 115in TV if you are spending this much on a display and you aren't at least buying a decent Soundbar system yeah what are you doing do we know how much "this thing costs yet so 20,000 for the" special edition still don't know how much the regular one is but probably at least like 15 grand or something I doubt
it would be half no it's not it'll be like 18 or 19 exactly or 20 the special edition might just be how the heck are we supposed to attach the feet to this thing that's a great question we'll answer that after we take a look at the io it's got four HDMI 2 of which can do up to 4K 144 Herz with a supported input it's got a couple USB ports coax hardwired Lan spiff and this is interesting it's still got an AV in though it doesn't come with a little adapter wa dude these speakers are
trippy oh there's speakers on the side that's why it's angled out like that too that's actually kind of exciting because it's been years since I've seen a TV that has proper front-facing speakers this this might have okay sounding speakers there's more up here these might be height yep oh these might also be cooling vents so we'll see oh fair enough wait I think I found the cooling we've got four vent spots at the back two at the bottom and two at the top and if these are for cooling it's for very
good reason because this thing is raed "at a staggering 10,000 nits Peak" brightness to put that in context the TV "we're replacing was already 5,000 nits" Peak brightness and was among the brightest sets on the market this thing is going to throw a spectacular amount of light and it's about more than just brightness a big part of the reason that many modern TVs struggle with the bt2020 color space is that while they might be able to make that green they can't make that green with greater luminance they
don't have the color volume with that said just because this has great color volume doesn't mean it has great color accuracy we're going to be testing that later for now I want to figure out how to get some bloody feet on it and I think these two pieces of foam on the side need to come out you ready I think she might tip plof okay dude they thought of this I think there's enough clearance in the bottom to put the feet on it I don't know they're pretty tall no no they go 
oh I wonder if those other covers are just extras then wait no I see it oh there's another set so if you have a narrow console you can put it in the middle middle you can put the feet scary close together it can still fit on here dude this screen's going to go all the way to the ceiling I'm going to front page r/ TV too high let's Mount them on the edges and we'll put it on the floor that's cool there's two different heights they're only about an inch apart so I don't imagine it's making that much
difference by the time your TV is this big but hey it's there it's great for Sound Bars oh that makes sense yeah if you want to put your soundar right underneath the TV where do you where do you get a  this thing is freaking huge I know that shouldn't surprise me anymore but like TVs have jumped the shark okay we going to try and do this thing yeah so we're going to what lift it up and then put it back here oh the fo the foam out oh that's the okay put it down put it down put it
down okay oh my hands yeah my oh my God that was terrible I've got it I've got the TV yeah give it a push there you go wow big moment that's bright it's pretty bright "10,000 the palm of my hand good Lord" even these thumbnails look incredible I don't think I've ever seen a bigger thumbnail in my life that thumbnail is like the size of the TV that's upstairs in my house Dolby Vision 12K let's go this does have Dolby Vision it's got HDR t 10 plus it's got HDR 10 hlg it's got
basically every HDR standard Under the  W it's like dazzling yeah look at the like star in the top right this is wild I can't wait to see like proper actual footage and not just a render this is with YouTube compression yeah this just initial Impressions here it's funny because I I'm actually getting a bit of uh bit of screen door not a time like it looks really good but we're too close we are way too close we're way too close those clouds we haven't even taken the peel off this
thing yet no that's true we haven't taken the peel off I would love to see this using the Wi-Fi 6E with something that's not just YouTube cuz we're getting a lot of compression like you can see in the lot of banding yeah a lot of banding still it still looks dazzling the saturation is crazy I also want to get it in filmmaker mode and see if we are just being a little bit Best Buy affected here yep we're in HDR energy saving yeah local dimming we're probably going to want High yep even set to low
it still looks like fine though it's so bright I'm going to go fast back light control on high peak brightness you know what the out of the box settings are not far off yeah I haven't had to change pretty much anything though we haven't gotten to Clarity yet personally I'm not a warm guy I'm a standard guy sorry sorry I'm basic Dynamic Color enhancer blah blah blah you can turn this this stuff on if you want and it probably looks good to the eye but out of the box it's off which it should be what I want
to know is if any of that like motion smoothing stuff is motion enhancement it's off by default no this is not that bad I do not like black frame Insertion I know a lot of purists like it but I can't stand the flicker it's got a color tuner calman service I mean what obviously you're going to want to calibrate a TV of this caliber yeah yeah dude that was pretty good that's pretty clean I want to watch a movie okay and I don't know if I can do it here actually there's one quick thing I want to see
before we go because vibrant color and dazzling brightness is one thing but without contrast it just doesn't land how is this going to handle this OLED demo footage it's pretty good it's not getting to pure black I'm having a real right I can make out a tiny bit of glow "if I'm this close yeah 40,000 plus" dimming zones it's hard to tell how much of it is caused by a little bit of glow around bright objects on the TV and how much of it is caused by the veiling glare in the eye which gives you a
little bit of glow around bright objects just from your eye that is really good and we've got the studio lights on too oh dude how are the viewing angles even off AIS cuz that's where a lot of full array local dimming will fall on its face it'll look great headon but once you get off axis it doesn't look it it's still really good I couldn't get this close to it when I was at CES try this be speakers no let's try the speakers let's try them in the theater okay yeah let's go hey no problem Robert well this is
the easy part uh go go to your right hey see it's not so bad that was the easiest part of this entire we we be professional TV installers absolutely not easy easy easy hey Adam how you doing good that's a big TV now that we have it in front of that one it doesn't look as big that big it's still it it's pretty big but when we had it next to the 75 in that was in the recck room enormous I bet that thing looked like a TV for mice here's the question to have in your mind sure because realistically these are in
a pretty similar price bracket yeah as we watch content here would you accept the 5 in smaller screen for the better performance let's watch I don't think there's any question let's watch let's watch fine this is it  through oh it's just a little bit cleaner a little bit brighter I swear we're going to actually watch something but first let's hear these speakers it's okay yeah louder doesn't necessarily mean better I'd say it's up there with like kind of a basic Soundbar but you
"bought a $20,000 TV not a $20,000 sound" system so let's pivot away from the TV speakers and let's actually watch some  here do that   light wow it's pretty good we're not losing any of those like tree details in the back or like the shadows in there yeah look at this it's actually pretty good even in the low lights of her hair I can make out individual hairs it's bright but it isn't white oh my God look at that flash that's wild the amount of detail you can see in there and all the
colors and everything just look pristine because of the quantum dots that was probably what was helping so much with the viewing angles earlier as well is it's it's a quantum dot mini LED I am blown away by how much detail there is in the shadow of all the observers and in the like the camera flash itself yeah that was wild I don't think I've ever had that much brightness just thrown at me at once that was full field that was the whole screen it probably wasn't "10,000 nits it does that in you know"
like a 2% window or whatever we'll get some speeds and feeds after we've actually measured it up for you guys later yeah this too though the yellowness yeah of this brightness it can make things bright without turning them white [Laughter] wo holy crap balls that transition yeah that was good you're going to keep the "other TV now like come on 10,000 nits" it's twice the brightness and it's got over twice the amount of diming zones and the quantum dot means the viewing angles are just like perfect the other
one's quantum dot oh okay fair enough all right they're both quantum dot but the difference in dimming zones huge I don't think I've ever seen that scene look that good I've seen it look that good but not like not this big cuz I'd argue that like a cutie OLED like right in front of you like if I got really close or even like a new LG G4 or something it's going to look slightly better than that nope you're you're not wrong wrong but at  experience wow the colors all still really pop too
like all the little Reds and greens on their uh on the on the shoulders oh yeah there's something about a brighter display that really makes makes the image look true to life instead of like you're watching it on a screen and we're not even looking at something with a lot of specular highlights or anything like that but I feel like I'm looking at a cloudy overcast day you know as opposed to watching a movie about a cloudy overcast day I know we're in your theater room yeah but I feel like I'm at
the movies oh yeah a screen this big is gamechanging for immersion and there is no doubt in my mind this is a better looking screen than the one that it's sitting in front of yep and that was already really nice yeah this SC looks great you can see all the Viking horns and helmets in the back even though it super dark D oh my god did you see the glint on the shoulder plate there even even in a dark scene like this yeah the leather looks so leathery mhm the metal looks so metally things
are vibrant yeah but not they're not they're overselling it no oh the on I know I saw the same thing I saw the little sparkles on that oh man yeah holy  god dude this looks so good the high sense might have to be the one yeah no I told you the high sense was going to be the one I didn't think so I thought I "was going to keep the bigger one 10,000" "nits and 40,000 dimming zones I know" dude I can't find the dimming zones it's really good it looks so good like look at the the black bars are black I know
they're black I know did we at any point mention the model number of this TV I don't think so it's the 110 ux hey we can go up to 144 without an AMD card now okay but will it stay that's the real question okay we got it working turn on HDR let's see if we get 10 bit okay wow here we freaking go we're going to test the latency later to see if High sense's new chip actually actually can power something like this and not add a bunch of extra latency but uh I think I can tell you the answer it's good it
feels really good really dude gone completely dead are the days of terrible gaming experiences on large format displays even modern projectors are pretty good these days but these large format TVs man just leave them in the dust and you know what the mouse is your worst case scenario forom there's a little bit Yeah open like paint or something you bet I'm way ahead of you brother you can actually see it adjusting it's not as bright see the cursor brightness goes down especially as it makes its way into
the Zone but the bloom is negligible I'd like to see them manage this better sure but that's probably a setting in fact I think it reset a bunch of the settings now that we're in game the auto dimming stuff y yeah I bet we can tune this what's fast backlight control oh improve the speed at which the backl follows not available at high refresh rate that's okay I wonder if that's hurting performance a little bit then I think that's something that could be improved you can also really see that the overall
brightness goes down when I have a much larger window yeah but they're not "advertising 10,000 nits full screen no" to be fair it's not to the point where I would consider it to be a problem no this is a very pleasant brightness to use even when I have a full oh that was big screen that's pretty DM shrink it again that's pretty DM shrink it again yeah yeah okay how often are you going to use this as a computer though cuz it's not it's not going to do that in games almost
never almost exclusively it gets used with the Nvidia Shield yeah dude this looks really good dude this looks really good that looks freaking awesome a how was that not a head shot you're using a sniper rifle it should have just killed him shouldn't it know I mean I would have thought so how the hell am I not hitting anything cuz you're not playing at 360 HZ on an OLED yeah that must be the problem this would be absolutely perfect for something like smash as well or like
four player split screen Mario Kart oh dude we've done it it's awesome yeah and this one's just that but better even better this is an amazing display dude I I don't think you need the 5 in diagonally that you've got with the TCL I think it's worth switching to this one 100% she's real good it's really good damn that's right I play take that Bots that's right I know how to kill the Bots it's very usable oh this is more than usable this is good I don't think I'd ever complain if I showed up to
someone's house and this is the display I was playing on no you'd be such a dick if you did oh yeah the real question is we've got it set up here are you going to leave it here the accounting is complicated I bought the TCL fair enough whereas high sense was nice enough to send this to the company for review and it's a "$20,000 unit so you know thank you high" sense yeah I'm not going to complain I get to play Counter-Strike on it it's pretty sick now the question is are we subjectively good judges of TV
performance or is the lab going to prove us wrong let's find out brightness on the high 110 ux was all over the place depending on how we tested it but an SDR stand mode we measured a staggering peak of over "24,000 nits in a 2% window that Peak is" very shortlived but it's there and if we set it to HDR standard it peaked closer "to 17,000 and then slowly dropped off" with different results depending on if we had Dynamic tone mapping on or off as for color gamut because we were so
amazed with how bright it got we were really hoping to see 90 plus% coverage of the bt2020 color space well unfortunately that's not the case and despite the high peak brightness and Quantum dots we measured a top end of just under 83% still respectable but not what we were hoping for kind of like our color accuracy in SDR filmmaker mode we measured an average of 4.7 and a Max of 8.7 Delta e2000 that's pretty good for a giant VA panel with HDR though with tone mapping disabled and testing with de ITP
we got an average of almost 22 and a Max of nearly 57 that's not amazing but it looked pretty good when we were watching content on it maybe we were just two star struck by how bright it got not sure last but not least latency in 144 HZ game mode we measured 5.7 milliseconds that's 2.2 millisecs higher than the theoretical perfect for end to end click to Photon latency we got an average of 20.1 milliseconds it's not OLED and I can't recommend this TV if you're trying to
win your next Counter-Strike or valerant match but come on it's huge even if the accounting is simple this isn't an easy decision they're both great this has the edge when it comes to the best possible picture quality y but the TCL has size barely barely I'd say you're going to be happy with either one and it is a pretty exciting time to be alive that not only do gigantic format displays like this exist but there is competition in the space just like there's competition to see who can segue
