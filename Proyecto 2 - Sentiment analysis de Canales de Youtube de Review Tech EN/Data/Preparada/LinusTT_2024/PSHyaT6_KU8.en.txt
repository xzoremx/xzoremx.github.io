I have got to send a picture of this thing to my old boss check it out the NC sign PC is off the story piece of cardboard and on the wall and guys look at this thing I mean what a way to celebrate those formative years of my career at the computer store and it's even super fast hey keep it down future lus do you ever want to get that thing we got a lot of work to do over here Justin did a great job with this MDF backboard fun fact uh he couldn't just use an NC logo to design it since their signs and
graphical assets were all slightly different from each other so it had to be painstakingly custom modeled and cut but now that the paint's dry we are ready for final assembly oh my God this looks awesome awesome like our sponsor War Thunder War Thunder is an action-packed and detail packed vehicle combat game you got to have both you can play free right now on PC and console at the link below since we started this project basically everything about it has changed starting with the
motherboard we've gone with the b650 aorus ultra from gigabyte it might lack some of the nice to Hales like the abundance of ports and PCI elanes that you'd find with x670 but it features 20 gig USB and CPU overclocking which the a620 lacks this particular board also supports pcie Gen 5 which is an optional feature of the chipset and uses 2 1/2 gig onboard networking which is slower than what we used to use for our workstations but that was back when we were shooting at 8K this should be
enough for our modern 4K workflow and if it's not these handy m.2 network cards are a great way to add 10 gig to an ITX board then for our CPU we went with the ryzen 7 7800 x3d it might lag behind the 13700 K or even the 7700 X for non-gaming tasks but it's still a wicked fast 8 core CPU and it's very power efficient thanks to its lower rated TDP which is critical for a small form factor build which okay it's kind of a large computer but it's going to be in a confined space and that's going to
matter also we have about eight of these left over from the recent video where we bought a whack of them to evaluate the variation in performance from Chip to chip um so I grabbed one by the way that's a super cool video and you're going to want to check it out on the subject of cool figuring out how to cool this machine was a big challenge we wanted all the major components mounted inside the letters otherwise how is it even a sign PC it would just be a PC next to a sign but we also wanted the
finished install to be as clean as possible so no gaping holes in the sides of our letters for intake fans so we settled on a two-pronged approach water cooling and hope water to carry away most of the Heat from the major components like the CPU and the GPU and then Faith along with some teeny tiny fence to remove the rest not a huge fan of the mounting on these velocity squared blocks but you can't fault the look man are they sexy for storage while this motherboard does support pcie Gen 5
drives which theoretically are double the speed of Gen 4 in practice that offers no perceivable benefit for daily use so I settled on a crucial P5 plus since all I need is a decent Drive I don't even really need a DRM cache that isn't going to immediately die almost everything that I work on is going to be stored in the cloud or on one of our servers which is why networking speed is much more important to me than the speed of my SSD another area where speed matters is memory and we've gone with
this Manta X prism ddr5 6400 cl32 kit "6,000 to 6,400 megat transfers per" second is still The Sweet Spot for AMD when it comes to price to Performance and this kit is in that range I don't know much else about it hopefully Works time to mount this boy and how would I describe this build so far Exquisite exceptional extraordinary but unless I plan on running an IG GPU I still have more itms to install perhaps in the next letter over the width of this letter was a big challenge for us to overcome when we
went looking for a GPU even with water cooling most modern cards are so tall that they won't fit in here once you account for the foam for the mounting even before you factor in that most GPU water blocks have the fittings attaching up here so we needed something where the fittings go on the back now as a business machine for business this GPU isn't going to be doing a ton of heavy lifting but we needed to be able to handle playback of raw 4K footage without issue high quality screen screen
capture and I do occasionally fire up a game or two just in case I need to you know quickly check something out for business reasons of course so we settled on this Nvidia RTX 3070 collab card between Asus and EK water blocks now let's see where should we put the power supply you see where I'm going with this right our original plan was to use a Silverstone sfx power supply that we had fulllength cables for but unfortunately during a test build that ended up exploding in a most underwhelming way
which probably had nothing to do with the amount of metal shavings around the workshop thankfully we had other options and this white unit from Cooler Master actually might help us reflect more light from the RGB strips that we're going to be putting in later as well it's a bit of a change from the seic focus PX 850s that we usually use in our workstations but it's a suitable sfx alternative and with the correct number of wash brers should install just fine if you plan on getting one of these by
the way keep an eye out for the badge on the front of the box that says 100% Japanese capacitors version one lacks that badge but more importantly lacks proper fan control and can get kind of loud thankfully for us we've got the nansai Ichibon version and we can attach it to our back plate with the screws I showed you before and actually this cool 3D printed Mount that I didn't show you before but if you want to check it out more closely we're going to have it linked down below if you ever need to
mount a power supply to a back plate for some reason finally we need the place to put the remainder of our liquid cooling parts okay that one was not very good realistically we could have gone for any size of ek's quantum kinetic flat D5 so we went with the 240 mm version it comes with a reliable D5 pump and gives us lots of room to Route tubing first to our radiator here on the other side speaking of before we put this in we went with the EK Quantum surface s360 it uses copper fins and a balanced fin
density for solid performance regardless of your fan speed which matters a lot more to us than usual because even though these Noca spin at a decent speed they are low profile fans so they have lower static pressure than usual and we wanted to use these to accommodate the fact that the N letter is going to be sitting right over top of it and where is the intake for these rather the exhaust we're going to do something a little bit different on this one just because of the lack of space constraint
here uh we're actually going to take one of these fans and we're going to use it as an exhaust instead of having all intake oh I see okay that is an option another option would be to just put some speed holes in here as well and then just have it passively exhaust out the rest of the end can we do the speed holes recirculating the air that you just heated up not that effective man this is looking awesome also Tanner did you realize how big this thing was this is going to take up the whole wall in my
office yeah it's going to take up the whole wall like it would at the front of a store right which makes perfect sense yes here if you want a smaller ncx sign here take that where'd you get this the bottle opener flashlight keychain combo  ncx are we about to make a fire here we go and I know I know softline yuck right but come on guys it's a lot easier to work with we're not going to see the thing anyway and it gives us a great excuse to show you guys our magnetic Cable Management clamps
that are coming very soon CD store.com I think that's it and if we were smart especially because this is made out of MDF which gets completely destroyed by water we would check to see if it leaks before we go ahead and fire it out properly so I think we can fill it up what is this Canadian water cooling fluid comes in a bag now yes sir like our milk yep sure hey there we go there we go that's more like now we're moving some water this seems like a good time to talk about our RGB fan controller here oh but
before we put that on I should talk about our pcie risers we could have used a single Gen 4 600 mm Riser but you noticed instead we used a 600 mm and then we used another 100 mm one what the heck is up with that the problem is that we couldn't find a single Riser at that length that had a right angle connector on it and we really needed a right angle Le connector so we had to use an extension that means it might run at pcie gen 3 speeds but with this generation of gpus that's not going to
affect performance anyway so hey Riser connector no problem we hope come to think of it there's no reason to stay under there while I talk about the RGB lighting we can just talk about it here and then put it down thereafter each of our letters already has some addressable RGB strips going all around the outside you know nothing fancy just a casual 10 m of RGB lighting and then each letter plugs into the next one using these cool jsts SM connectors or as I like to call them nice clippies
you'll sometimes find these on larger string lights and unlike okay that looks amazing sorry um unlike those awful standard RGB header connectors that plug into your motherboard these things do a fantastic job of staying attached the only reason that we subbed out Corsair own RGB strips was because we wanted something that we could a little bit more easily cut and then route as needed this did present some challenges um we're using our commander Pro to handle the logic but these lights are a
mishmash of the RGB and AR argb standards so they're three pins like AR argb voltage data and ground but instead of the usual 5vt power it's got classic old rgb's 12vt requirement um this is for good reason because it helps with efficiency and getting more consistent brightness out of the first and last LEDs in the strip but it means we can only use the data lines from our commander and we need to draw 12v power from somewhere oh so we just used a Molex connector which is probably say
what's the power draw on these 1.5 amps 1.5 amps that'll be fine just fine we're not ready to put these on are we are we done we should probably do a test boot and make sure everything actually functions I see other than that it looks like everything is pretty much ready to go it was all just a setup yeah for the joke it's yeah yes we should do a quick test we got to hook up the fans too I see how we're going to hook everything up for our test boot here but have we given any thought to IO this all the io
is external it's all external yes oh like with a hub or something yeah you're going to have one of these ah yes okay thanks for our sponsor ug green who didn't sponsor this video but they do sponsor things occasionally uh power button your keys right now oh good there there will be one there will be  out we got letters is the pump running though oh wow yeah know it just has all the bubbles out of it wow fantastic oh hey nice oh that's good to see yes y all right how about Expo it's really
big oh this is a good opportunity for you guys to check out the back we cable managed some stuff here Justin we can put it down for a sec oh yeah oh yeah it's heavy this is also my first look at how we're handling Cable Management networking is going to be coming out of here neat neat uh where'd that USBC connector go oh look at that it's right there oh cool and if you look we've used this gap which is about 3 in Off the Wall not just for bottom mounted IO but also to have some room for our intake
fans wow this is not going to be easy um it's really heavy yes speaking of heavy you guys probably noticed these handy dandy handles that's how we're going to mount it we're going to lift up the ceiling tile and then we're going to hang it over this partition here the original plan had been to screw it into the wall but what we realized is these modular panels are just a piece of sheet metal some kind of something in between basically air and another piece of sheet metal so if we just drilled into this it
would either sag or completely come out and come crashing down onto my desk we did come up with one idea where we had a backing on the other side and we screwed all the way through into that but I was told that's not aesthetically pleasing what's that brick that's your power button it sits on your desk I see I tried to get one of those like remote clicker ones but we don't have any PCI slots feel like maybe I should have specified what I had intended with the power button but you
know what we're doing great no Colin you know what that's it's a really good idea but can we try it this way first Justin how you doing oh I'm fine okay I've got this Colin if you want to help him that's probably better okay all right so that's on and now I am stuck yes um wait  yet nice that is freaking awesome all right oh yeah I told man I didn't need the cable ties at all kind of clean uh okay let's um oh good thing that didn't break my Cleveland Browns lava lump did I just say lump 
moment that looks so freaking awesome no way oh hey oh really you guys it was like that when I got got it uhhuh keep changes nice you know what screw it we're turning hdr on oh good it looks forget it let's not turn hdr on for office work what we do want to know even for office work though is whether our cooling system works it's quiet but does it perform to find out I'll be running a stress test on both the GPU and CPU for 30 minutes to see if it can handle the heat all right we've
been benchmarking this for a little while now and the GPU looks like it's good but the CPU is running Mighty hot and that is very confusing until you take the X off and look at this block you might not be able to see it right away but some of you might be more eagley and notice that this Edge is much farther off than this Edge to the motherboard uh if you look at it through the thermal camera this thing is just shooting off heat and boy you can really kind of feel it over here it's uh it's
not a happy camper our GPU is fine though and that my friends is why we run stress tests it turned out that the fans on the radiator were hooked up to the commander Pro which was not getting an input from the CPU for its temperatures so the fans were staying running at minimum RPM and after about 15 minutes we thermal throttled going from about 80 watts of power consumption on the CPU to just 30 fortunately fixing it was as simple as getting those fans plugged into the pwm header that is on the
motherboard itself and we're back up to 78 Watts which okay it's still a little on the warm side in a perfect world I might throw full thick fans on there instead of the low profile ones but I will never be running such a long load on this system and I think I'm just going to leave it alone unless I were to upgrade the rest of the system like even putting in a more powerful GPU could dump more heat into the loop then we'd need to take another another look at the cooling but that's a problem for the
future a future where you'll already know about our sponsor War Thunder what could be more satisfying than watching huge Vehicles get blown up in a video game well the obvious answer is watching "over 2,000 Vehicles get blown up it's" simple math War Thunder is a free-to-play PvP with a focus on realism the combat is immersive every tank plane and ship is modeled after their real counterparts write down to how it feels to Pilot them and the sounds they make there's a game mode for everyone from
