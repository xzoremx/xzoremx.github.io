today right now with the help of whatnot I am ready to take your order that's right my friends you can have any PC you want as long as it is handbuilt by me right now we are also going to be auctioning off phones laptops a pre-build PC and more and whatnot has generously agreed to wave all the transaction fees with the proceeds from today's event going directly to BC Children's Hospital digital lab where they're using in Cutting Edge technology like VR and 3D printing to improve care
and reduce stress for kids that need specialized treatment so without any further Ado let's get started on our first machine I have absolutely no idea who's going to be taking this thing home but I do know that it is going to be flipping awesome let's crack open our CPU which was generously provided by Intel we've got a core I9 14900 K that's right my friends this is just about I shouldn't say just about this is as fast as it gets for modern gaming and we're going to be installing it on holy crap
is this ever a machine what the actual balls the Asus Rog back to front build  "5,569" nice8 absolutely balls to the wall the fastest we'll be building today no compromises and super clean Cable Management we're going to be using I didn't even know they had such a high-end back to front board the Maximus z790 hero BTF and if you guys are looking for a little bit more information about how to participate we're going to have our link to our sponsors as well as to whatnot who is
the auction platform that we're using  description man how does it have no connectors on the front and still manage to look busy as all crap we have got five different systems to build today guys and we've also got over 70 items to auction so things are going to be going a little bit fast fast like Elijah wow you're moving so fast this S I was waiting for you to be done with this one so I can take it just I'm just saying you're moving really you're moving really fast you're doing great okay sir
uh hold on let's just see if there's any accessories that we need here no Wi-Fi antenna not so much ooh M2 stickers yeah the children would go straight for the stickers okay all right good job Elijah all right let's go ahead and get this installed so uh Alex should we do our first non-pc auction item to get people warmed up here uh it seems like whatnot has crashed so whatnot crashed already well that was quick um in that case let's let's work on our system where' my box go oh I'm definitely going
to need it all the connectors are on the back oh we're back hey we're off to a good start ladies before before you go you need to read the accounting disclaimer the accounting disclaimer uhhuh oh okay so if you guys want to participate it's time to head over to whatnot and create an account you will need to submit identification before you can start bidding but this is necessary to prevent troll bids which have ruined our previous attempts at charity auctions also disclaimer from
accounting must read when bidding on items internationally you are responsible for any import duties taxes and brokerages that might be imposed by the destination country that is not our fault and it is not our problem thank you and good night well you got to you got to build the computer no I have to build all the computers okay goodness so we've got our 14900 K LGA 1700 this thing turos to wait is this the K this is the ks bloody hell this thing turbos over six flipping
gigz and 6.2 6.2 my friends and it goes in socket little something like this Andy I mean hey this is a PC Building stream right is this more of a speed build stream or am I going is it more more guideline and tutorial what are what are we actually going for here folks well it's actually a charity auction so now that one Knot's back up we can do the very first one let's do our first item okay this is the bit storage bit storage it's just like our screwdriver right see with the bit
storage like that but instead of a screwdriver it's just more bit storage it's like it's the it's the double fisted bit storage uh and this too can be yours for just whatever price uh the auction's going to be live for just 30 seconds and then every time someone bids again it resets for another 10 seconds so it comes with torqux and Metric bit sets and um we practiced sanding it to see if we could get a nice smooth finish our 3D printed prototype and the answer was no no we can't um so you get
to own this piece of product development history from Creator Warehouse uh thank you very much Elijah now let's go ahead and get our RAM installed in the system we've got 48 gigs of this vcolor Manta X prism ddr5 that runs at a whopping 8200 megat transfers per second this is extra heck fast Ram using SK chips and is this the one that yes oh this is super cool they did little LT logos on these memory sticks for us so um we appreciated that so much that we were like hey how about you generous
donator you can have it I are we going to get these running at 8200 if we don't we'll turn them down a little bit I'm sure the ram can do it but you never know with these CPUs sometimes they hit that speed sometimes they don't and sometimes I need to tell you guys about our sponsor oh just hold on for a second before you do that the bid's still going we're at $21 we're at $21 raised already for this for this what wait until you guys see the real stuff we have to Au this is
$251 you guys are fantastic I mean it is kind of cool pry I told them this was a real product now we're going to have to make no I'm kidding I'm kidding everyone all right go ahead and run that pre-roll Dan design GB vertical charging stand for Quest 2 3 and pro makes charging and displaying your VR headset convenient and eye-catching grab one today link down below Jes whoa we just nuked their eyes all right cool uh $321 what do I need next oh I need I guess I need my SSD oh my God Noah
Padden W it okay finally the auction is complete our first auction is complete for a total value of 3 21 $321 all right let's get that officially precious now oh my goodness all right cool oh man this is going to be a lot of fun you guys uh by the way strap in because we are probably going to be live for somewhere in the neighborhood of about 3 to five hours depending on how this goes so geez that's that's generous that's less hours than we have PCS and we normally don't do less than an hour for
PC well no no no this is GNA take less than an hour PC because guys I got this and Elijah is going to be unboxing whatever the parts I need next are to ensure that things go as quickly as possible well you've built computers before yeah but the case then I believe in him and I believe in Alex's ability to tell you all about our next auction item it's a banana and it's gold uh we wanted forther only be two of these but it turns out we got a lot more but this one is special because you personally
can get it are you starting itting now Chase yep all right as far as I'm aware the only other way to have obtained one of these in the past would have been to win it in the uh the special claw machine at LTX 20203 that was it that was all folks people internally have stolen a lot of the extra ones that we ended up with oh my it's $300 $300 already this is at $300 already Y for the Golden Banana that's incredible all right you know it's not actually gold right yeah it's not gold
it's golden color but look but look how perfect it is for determining the size of other objects now you know exactly how large this motherboard is huh ah yeah that's what I thought oh boy I pent some of the pins on the back of this motherboard already don't don't worry don't worry don't worry though that'll be fine uh perfect opportunity to tell you about our SSD for this build it's a 4 TB rocket 4 plus from sabrent it is still pretty wild to me that you can have four terabytes of storage in
the form factor of a gumstick Oh wait we're putting in more no so they're going to get this one this is our Windows boot drive with games on it so we're just going to be passing that between the computers oh I see oh wow well there's nowhere convenient to put this that it's going to be easy to get it back out so I guess I'll go with this slot absolutely fantastic so the banana sold $341 $341 for the banana thank you very very kindly and uh could I get the names of whoever the winning bids are as
we go through this whistling whistling wh thank you whistling for your purchase of a uh wonderful Golden Banana thank you Elijah okay you know what I have decided these are going to be speed builds speed but quality and uh Andy if you want to switch to the wide camera um let's go ahead and get that teleprompter off you because I think this is the point where the stream goes completely off the rails  goodness oh my God this case it's so heavy uh okay we have gone with the Rog
stricks Helios full tower it has a strap on the top which I don't see uh are oh maybe there's no strap on this one quite sure that that's what this is because I thought the Helios was a different thing huge it's a Hyperion oh this is a Hyperion okay and this back to front edition apparently debuted at CES of this year this is going to be the cleanest sickest machine holy shnikes you guys all right cool uh oh where' my laptop Go Alex can I have my laptop so I can monitor the
flan Che uh one second I don't trust these glass panels no that's perfectly safe what could go wrong I'm putting them in the bin yeah that makes sense all right this thing is M what the CRA one two three four 5 6 7even eight this has nine expansion slots on it I guess just in case you want to put in RTX 490 in your very bottom SLO or what like xlx has been dead for ages all right let's go ahead and pop this holy crap this motherboard has Wi-Fi s on it dual Thunderbolt
ports uh okay I assume we're going water cooling for this thing right so I can go ahead and install this motherboard all right let's find some mounting hardware here shall we it's crazy because is chunky with all the builds that we've been doing lately we haven't really gone super highend for the most part like I haven't even touched this case before look at this flipping integrated RGB and fan controller love to see it oh hey thank you so much Alex do you mind actually pluging in real quick as well we need
louder audio lonus is quiet said someone for the first time ever I don't think those are words that have ever been spoken before do you guys want to find us another uh I was just going to say while you're item to to auction want to offer off a big boy the ionio 2 yeah let's do it all right guys this is the io2 Retro power handheld gaming PC okay the "$1,500 value is probably a little" inflated based on the specs but it's still pretty respectable it's a ryzen 76800 u i don't know how much RAM it's
got but uh it's got a 1920 x 1200p screen it's got an A Hall OFA it's got Hall OFA triggers it runs Windows 11 and it can be yours for just whatever price it is the auction is officially live now thank you so much Elijah good catch uh where is my mounting hardware did anyone um is there any mounting hardware maybe uh mounting hardware for what uh for the uh case uh I mean it was a matter of time until we came across kind of small snafu oh wonderbar okay perfect let's go ahead
and get this motherboard mounted shall we oh we're going to have to time these builds I think if you guys time me then I will be highly incentivized to do them very quickly and it'll be probably a good thing for the overall length of this uh have you do you mind plugging that in really quick it's uh it's just on the floor it's a blue cable thank you so much all right it's a green cable how are you guys doing on this fine day by the way I think we've got chewy our community um what what is what is
technically the job titled our community coordinator he's going to be Manning merch messages today so if you guys have anything don't don't forget you can head over to LTT store.com and leave a merch message for the stream chewy you got anything for us yet we just have one potential all right hit me good yeah hello there thanks for the great stuff what's one thing that has changed over the years of lmg's existence away from me uh that you think  company man the biggest impact is always
a tough question because I think that there's you can kind of point at numerous inflection points I mean obviously when we when we first um when we first left NC was was huge uh instead of being kind of Tethered to their it turned out pretty dire future prospects we were able to forge our own path uh that was that was not always a given uh when we moved into the office here that was absolutely huge it gave us the the space and the flexibility to build out the team to what it is now we're 100 strong at this
point uh Alex you got any idea oh these are not number two Phillips uh inflection point that I can think of is when we got the Avid CNC router that's when we kind of went from like building stuff with ad Dremel to having a CNC router oh yeah the workshop that went just things got so crazy after that immediately I do really appreciate Asus uh sending us this this case but I will say that it can be a little challenging to build in uh between this motherboard having some of the deepest motherboard
armor that I've ever seen and this K's having a piece here that interferes with access to these two screwes I'm I know what I need would you like to announce the winner of this one though first uh go ahead all right uh who was it it was someone coola won the ionio 2 for $821 so thank you very much that is awesome pretty sick de all right all I need is more tools so I've got my stubby screwdriver for getting at these ones where there's the  go nope needs to be lower profile I
think man I love that that's okay I have my Precision driver prototype unfortunately I don't have the new version of the case that Sebastian just showed me today but that's okay we'll we'll make it work without it I'm going to start getting the AIO prepped uh that would be great thank you so much cuz we have ever so many computers to build today uh you want to hit me with another message you guys oh or with another item yeah let's it oh fun oh cool all right you should take it out
and show them yeah we've got a pulsar X2 whand edition if I recall correctly these were built for us exclusively for the whale PCS at the most recent LTX it's a pulsar X too so really solid Mouse except look it has an adorable little whale silk grained onto it how can you resist it well you don't have to you can join the charity auction at the link down below and it can be yours Elijah all right cool now let's see if I can figure out how to build a apparently chat's mad at
you because you didn't take the peel off the SSD heat sink uh yes I did oh okay then chat's wrong he did on the main one he didn't on our Windows boot drive but we're taking that one out later yeah that one doesn't matter that one's coming out I don't want to leave a residue on that one that was very much intentional man this is not the easiest to build in I feel like the end result is going to look very awesome but there check this out Andy there's not a ton of room to work in here got to get
the man we already have a winner for the mouse that's pretty tough okay most do uh halac $361 damn you know that there's four more of these um but thank you that is awesome guys we are going to raise a ton of money tens of thousands of dollars today that is super super cool I mean I've been looking forward to this stream all week but I really didn't think that it was going to go quite this well you guys are absolutely incredible all right let's see if I have enough depth to do
this now yes I do very nice oh rats if you guys were going to call me out for something it probably should have been that I installed the SSD here rather than here not that it's going to make a difference for performance but uh using the CPU PCI PCI Lanes is ever so slightly more better or in my defense I am live streaming and I missed it and it also doesn't really matter it's not a Gen 5 SSD anyway uh all right Elija hit me LTT water bottle night Edition we're going to put this up for auction we have
a bunch of different color water bottles this is the I believe the what is this the 40 oz 6 64 o sorry got a bunch of these we're going to let it go live get on these ones and what's really fun about these is this is the only way to get an LTT water bottle right now we are out of stock on the store of everything I I come onto the set earlier I'm like where'd you get all these water bottles from we haven't had stock on the store for ages well there you go this is now your chance to get some water
bottles so here you go I genuinely don't know how I'm supposed to get this out uh okay here let me have a look oh wow interesting this is a new a that I've not seen before the RG Rouen 3 360 AR argb please note remove the hex protection caps before startup what makes them a hex protection cap um so then no one will cast a a voodoo hex on your radiator I'm not sure wow Alex I thought you were I thought you had perhaps missed something obvious no I don't know how to do it well while
you figure that out we already have a winner uh yes oh my gosh you just launched something I don't know what it was okay good thing you had a helmet on your Exo $181 for the water bottle we should make our water bottles more limited cuz then we can sell them I'm kidding this is all for charity  everyone don't worry he works in the writing Department not the not the merch Department he's done he's not allowed to set pricing for things anymore all right want to give me uh want to give me another item well I
fight to get this plastic off of here I got one of them out I think it's a twers job Alex here so here um okay this can go I'm going to use this to protect my eyes yeah I'm going to push it together and then if you can get under it there we go you did it good job Reddit all right Elijah if you don't mind Uh I that one for for you all right we've got an apost Bob Ross mouse pad my talking points for it say approximately $30 value stormy seas  pretty it is pretty and it can be yours
with the charity auction going live now Elijah oh here's the packaging oh stop I wasn't ready such a drama King okay um may I have a back plate yes good gravy I can't believe you guys um well thank you for accounting for that our buyers should have excellent cooling but uh aiio systems sure take a lot longer to build oh cool look at this oh wow ha they're magnetic that's actually super cool all right I'll allow  well thank you very much Crystal Crystal lier I probably butcher that $191 thank 
wow absolutely incredible all right let's go ahead and get this aiio mounted we're using a triple 120 mm all-in-one cooler this is both for performance and just because I don't know this build is the absolute top speec thing so I guess we're just going to go with everything being the absolute top speec thing uh we're going to be roof mounting this bad boy and what are you up to Alex uh I had floral fo floral foam stuck in my uh screwdriver here cuz we CT scanned it we've got we've got a Luma field see the
Hat it's so sick I love it that video is coming probably in the next week or two April 21st oh we have a we have a date for it okay probably April 21st I mean you never know sometimes things get pushed but uh it is going to change the game if you want guys want to see some of the the results off our C scanner already if you head to LTT labs.com a couple of the reviews that are up or I shouldn't say reviews because they're more of a product page if Elijah wants to keep on doing this a couple of the
product pages have you know it's okay I can do this um a couple of the product pages are up and they have CT scans of the product so you can see very precise dimensions and it also allows us to get an inside view of the product without destructively uh tampering with it so on the one hand yeah it's no problem for us to disassemble a GPU for example we I put in one screw oh we are fully capable of that um but if we ever wanted to perform thermal testing on that GPU again that would be problematic because
we would have changed it from its Factory configuration so this allows us to have a look at the cooler configuration and the board layout without taking the cooler off which is super flipping cool um ah I don't know Alex should I go for the aesthetic option or the easier maintenance option this is going to an actual person to use though aesthetic maintenance though M aesthe oh someone's easier to clean no but then you don't see the RGB what is the point of having RGB fans if you
don't see the RGB you can see it in the top no but it's so much better when you're looking up in you see like Linus's face on this OLED screen right here and you've got the RGB it's going to be so great yeah it has an OLED screen on the cooler H all right well I don't know what does the chat say you want aesthetic or you want the uh the better look or rather do you want aesthetic or do you want easier maintenance let's see they want performance no no the performance is the same guys it's that's
not the options the options are Aesthetics or easier maintenance easier cleaning so you can just pull the dust off like this aesthetic always RGB RGB RGB oh my goodness all right fine Alex you win let's go oh all right and then do we know which end the actual connectors go are they on the mail end of the Pogo pins or the other one uh that's a fantastic question we should find that out before we go much further that is right here oh man if this was a regular this puts a lot of
extra pressure on me you guys if this was a regular live stream and we were just going to take the system apart and put it back in inventory after I wouldn't worry about putting in every screw you know little details like that   could okay the bad news the bad news is these fins are dented the good news is you guys picked the aesthetic option which puts the fans here so you'll never see it aesthetic perfect and and let the record show that wasn't me not like Shaggy It Wasn't Me like
that actually was not me you saw him do it that was not me what I have done though there's the CT scan of my screwdriver look at that isn't that just cool we can look at the x-rays of it right here uh maybe there it is look at that x-ray of my screwdriver anyway speaking of screwdriver you guys want to auction off a stubby prototype this is I think one of the first fully functioning ones specifically number nine uh it says don't ask what happened through 1 through eight so there you go you get
the ninth uh ninth St uh screwdriver  science uh it has partially 3D printed Parts oh yeah yeah and partially production parts and the reason for that is because we reused some of the parts from the original screw driver but some of them needed to be remolded to account for the stubbies um stubby perfectly  stature all right I I need my chat here um yeah oh man yeah we should we should call the full-sized one the Alexander and call that the Alex that's pretty good did you guys know that Alex in
between of the stubby prototype is Enigma Blade with $261 Wow thank you thank you very much Enigma blade that's fantastic did you guys know that Alex in between his other two full-time jobs actually designed the ergonomics of the screwdriver I did that was not you know it was really difficult it was not the whole project but it was I think one of the most critical Parts because if we couldn't get ergonomics that he and I agreed on I think it just wouldn't have moved forward yeah I liked one that was
about an inch longer and then it was really difficult to get it so that lonus with his not so big hands and everyone else was very happy with  balance as all things should "be any who laptop time yes $1,500 laptop" the Acer Predator Helios neo6 it's got the 14th gen Intel I9 14900 HX the 14th gen the only one the one wow the only one ever made exclusive um disclaimer that's not actually true uh it's also got a 4060 in here uh it's 16x 10 aspect ratio which is like the perfect one uh and the auction is going
to start right now going for a minute on this we're going for a minute on because it's a high valuee you've got a minute to think about I mean everything's been a high value so far oh yeah we could auction off toenail clippings from Elijah at this point and I think they do pretty good no can we not oh my goodness I'm just saying we could I was traumatized for a  no sir okay can it with the sir thing we've been through this all right I'm I'm ready up top all right uh I am not I
need a second to figure out what our Oriental mation is going to be here and I'm good yep that's going to be it perfect cool if you just want to put in like two screws and we'll call that good for now for now we're going to put in   man these CPU block units have really undergone a bit of a transformation over the last 10 years remember when they used to be small like a little tiny Puck that went over top of your CPU and then they added like lights and you know fancy sort of housings on them and then
they added cooling fans and then they added screens um well Asus said all of the above and built this monstrosity it does have pre-applied ther compound though so that'll save us 10 seconds we got a winner laptop oh fantastic what fun and then a bunch of numbers I'm sorry I don't remember the numbers but it was uh "$2,120 so thank you very much holy crap" do we have a running total so far you guys is I would love to hear what we're up to so far $77 that doesn't and how many people are watching this thing
there was I don't I don't have any of my stats or anything I'm just here building computers we got sorry a th000 people watching on whatnot oh on whatnot that's specifically whatnot ah okay that makes way more sense I was like oh that actually seems a little long I'm just say it was a misclick I apologize does that mean all right cool I don't know if that's how that works uh Steve Stephen do you have any  us any updates on the new water bottle Lids are they coming soon or soon TM oh
yes I do have an update on the new water  this is an injection molded sample so not a 3D printed sample this came from the manufacturer that we are planning to use you can see that it Bears a striking resemblance to our old water bottle lid but there are a handful of critical differences first of which being the  before that poor table no longer a problem exactly uh we have significantly reinforced this part right here which has been a breakage issue for some customers um don't worry the trust me
bro guarantee ensures that you will get a replacement one the black one oh yeah Andy says his is broken so yeah you can see uh occasionally these do fail here so we have added significant reinforcement to that joint um another change is and this is this is going to be a little controversial but I I assure you there's a really good reason is we've moved the threading to the outside of the spout rather than the inside so what that means is when you're drinking you're going to feel the
threads on your lips but they're not sharp they are rounded off um they're also a super super aggressive thread so you only have to turn it like 3/4 of a turn I think it works out too um so it's not it's not too bad but hygienic it's way easier to clean so having the threads there means that you can just with and they're not super deep just with like a sponge or whatever that you're using to clean your water bottle you can easily get in there and you can clean it so that was a major major
consideration for us in the design of this one you can see that in the inside of the cap as well so that O-ring has a little tab on it um that allows it to with a little toothpick or with a little Dental pick or just anything uh with any tool easily be grabbed pulled out and cleaned and put back in and then we've done the same thing uh oh actually we haven't done the same thing on the inside one I forget what the plan is here this is non-final this is T1 sample whatever but uh we're
doing something with the one in here to make that one pretty easy to get out and replace as well so uh durability improvements uh hygienic improvements and other than that I from our point of view if it ain't broke don't fix it said it's a pretty decent spout lit already just needed to be just needed to be improv ulated a little bit uh Elijah what can I do for you say do you want to read off our next bundle this is a big one oh a bundle you said yeah it's an Alienware bundle it
includes a gaming keyboard a gaming mouse and a gaming headset I have all three of them right here I just can't hold all of them and the notes uh um oh my goodness there's a lot here uh so the "mouse which is at the frontier 8,000 HZ" pulling rate something just almost fell out wo let me get that for you thank you very much Chief apparently has 120 hour battery life uh at the th000 Herz pulling rate which is pretty crazy only weighs 59 Grand barely feels like it's even in
here oh man the keyboard which almost fell out and I dropped earlier 75% form factor uh 40 G of actuation force on all of the keys as well as the headset 2.4 gig USBC dongle or the 3.5 mm Jack and 30 hours of battery life all right so we got the 720h we've got their prowire gaming keyboard and then we've got their Pro wireless gaming mouse and so the whole bundle is about $500 and we're doing this whole bundle right now and it's live I talked to the designer of these two right here and apparently
these key switches that they have made have the lowest inconsistency between them in actuation force of any key switch on the market that's what the designer says now be in mind we haven't validated that with our keyboard tester and the lab uh yet that is really close to being working now with the robot arm uh but we're not quite there yet so that's a manufacturer claim as it is right now but I mean I don't know how's it actually feel he was also like one of the most like scientific minded guys
that I've ever met he made sure that they said that this m is less than 60 G because depending where you are in the world it can be like 59 58 because of like you know the difference in gravity and so they wanted to be sure that it's less than 60 would think as a scientifically minded person he would know that grams are mass and don't change well but your scale will say different things that's true thank you to graceful Muse for winning this auction at $641 $641 okay what's our running total at you guys
"$3,118 um the Predator hilos I think it" has to be re auctioned later cuz that transaction didn't go through but it'll come back around one of our transactions didn't go through but for the ones that have gone through we've raised over "$3,000 already that's flipping awesome" all right let's get this AI installed this is a huge fan what is this even doing oh I get it so this is providing cooling for the vrms here there's little ducks under here so it's basically blowing all of the air down at these
heat sinks here and then we're just going to go ahead and pop this bad boy on here uh yeah a little something like that and we're installed hey Alex can I pass you can we maybe tag team the front IO connectors most certainly or wait oh right this is a back to front configuration okay we will be tag teaming nothing um I will hand you the one connector that's on my side and then I guess you will oh yeah they're all back here yeah there you go all right let let me just route this a little bit
more nicely and then we should be good to go hey chewy you got anything for us yeah magnets magnets and magnets again any plans to offer the MCM products in white okay so we get this question about pretty much every product and I think that what a lot of people don't realize is that in spite of us being uh you know we think reasonably cool and stuff uh we're actually a pretty small company overall and when you add another I hope this is is the CPU fan header back there this says Mr test
to there's also a fan header you know what I'm going to take it I I see the fan header oh you got it okay cool uh we're a pretty small company and when you change the color of a product you're not just buying some color pellets and then shooting into a mold with different color pellets you are also buying and inventorying enough of the finished goods in those colors to support putting them on sale then on an ongoing basis you are managing the inventory levels of that product and providing support for
that product so there is significant overhead in involved in bringing anything to Market no matter how big or small it is and so for us to um for us to be able to sell something in multiple colors we need to have sales volumes that are high enough not just for us to hit our minimum order quantities and make it worth the overhead of managing them but we have to be able to do that on a per color basis okay that magnetic connector for this thing is super cool check this out Andy come come come come
check this out so for those three fans power and RGB just like that oh I love it so the answer is a definite maybe we'll see what happens oh what's this it's the water bottle that buddy won he asked if we could sign it oh  course okay uh are you signing it as well sure all right why not good stuff all right so since I've got nothing to do over on my side here I guess I could put in a GPU hey thanks Elijah right here buddy is this like a special back to front GPU no way oh that's super cool uh what does
this say oh my God this is okay is a "$2,000 GPU I mean that makes sense check" this out so it's got is sua's special power connector here for their back to front edition graphics cards I can't believe that this is finally happening like I remember remember when uh what's his name oh Andy I was looking for Andy he's behind the camera um what's his name DIY ape that that guy in China that does those cool like back to front mods back in the day um like when he sent over his system
I was like yeah man this is super cool but you know it's super cool but there's never going to be an ecosystem for this because the computer industry can't even decide on standardized a standardized layout for the front panel connector header like how can't even just use USBC exactly exactly so how could you possibly hope to get something like this off the ground and yet um you know through the efforts of modders like him through the efforts of insiders in the industry who are making an effort to
spearhead these projects internally um through the negotiations I guess with patent holders like main gear um it looks like it's finally happening which is super cool cuz it really does make a big difference to the Aesthetics of the finished build however with that said it's not the kind of thing that I would want to pay a ton of extra money for so in order for all of those things to be true at the same time for it to look cool and not cost a lot extra back to that little lecture I gave about
maintaining different skews of the same product before the sales volumes have to be high enough that the overhead of maintaining these additional skews is not going going to adversely affect the pricing so we need people to kind of buy into it in order for it to gain enough sales volume for it to be sustainable and for it to be affordable in the longer term and oh my goodness what am I compensating for no right answers my goodness it's like two bananas holy I mean speaking of the
banana though the guy saw you signed the water bottle asked you to sign this too now you've started something I didn't start anything I started it I knew what I was doing there you go well we might as well pre-sign this one then cuz this is going to be our next auction all right cool violet water bottle it's going up for auction right now 64 o there you go thank you very much now I get to spend the next 19 minutes of my life peeling plastic off of this GPU I guess now is the perfect opportunity to
tell you guys a little bit about it I mean there's stuff I know already it's a 490 so it has 24 gigs of uh ggdr 6X memory it's flipping fast fastest consumer GPU on the market right now oh my God the cooling on this thing so it's got a couple of fans that are blowing into the heat sink against the PCB and out this way and then it's got one fan that is dedicated to blowing right through it just like a Founders Edition card what else does Aus have to say for themselves on this thing it's three and
a half slots wide so it's a good thing we weren't it's a good thing we didn't have any other pcie slots on this motherboard because we wouldn't be installing anything in them anyway and uh it's got a vapor chamber and heat pipes to keep it nice and cool I mean at this size you could probably just put a freaking brick of copper on it and that would keep it cool just fine I'm relax I know your signature definitely increased the water bottles $266 thank you very much paau you know what's funny we've had
people request many many many times uh to buy signed things on the store and we've always kind of said you know no I don't like charging for my signature I joke about it at at events or trade shows or whatever people walk up and ask me to like sign their phone case or you know stuff like that and I'll be like 10 bucks and they'll be like uh oh actually forget it I'm like no no I'm just I'm just kidding I'm just kidding uh but the thing about making jokes like that is ever so occasionally
you'll have people who think you were serious and um talk about you online and what a Jer you are so that's the thing that's my that's my biggest problem is I think I'm funny uh what can I do for you I think you're  you see that was funny now I'm sad yeah get wrecked what the heck Dan uh okay well hey massive shout out Google Canada for this one yeah Google Hazel bundle nice we've got the pixel 8 Hazel so that's what a color yes that makes sense or grayish um 1080p OLED screen I mean it's
a pixel 8 you guys you guys know what it is it's freaking awesome it comes with all the latest Google features uh all their latest AI advancements but we've also got a whole bundle to go with it we've got the pixel Watch 2 LTE this is the 41 mm version I guess oh good that's what I'm holding yes there we go there it is oh man that's really pretty check that out I haven't actually tried one of these yet so yeah pixel Watch 2 LTE uh 4G LTE connectivity even if you forget your
phone we've got a moment case got the moment case and like camera lenses that you can add okay the whole thing close "the whole thing is about a, what is it," about "$1,300 okay and the auction starting" right now all right check it out guys oh man this is going really fastish sort of let's get this GPU in here shall we o first things first oh man I'm really excited we've got an upcoming video where we're going to be doing another uh first person view build cide I can't get in here do we have a fixed shaft
screwdriver uh we're going to be releasing you know what I have a job for Colin okay Colin can you please get me screwdriver the end just one just one end change it  warehouse thank you um you know what I think the program that brought him over here has actually been really constructive for all parties um he's doing really really great and he improves every day um let's go ahead and get this going here yeah no I cannot do this um Alex maybe how don't I get the power supply going here where is it it's
over here oh you have it no wait no you don't here it is I did have it all right fantastic uh I assume this is the Thor 1200 watt Platinum 2 yep yep Zer RPM fan mode it's got an OLED screen on the side because hey you know when you get bored of watching your monitor and the games you're playing you could just look at this screen and see how much power your system is consuming cuz you know you love geeking out over stuff like that it's fully modular and it comes with a 10year warranty this thing is flipping
sick let's go ahead and get it installed shall we oh this is a really dangerous place for this GPU I will find a slightly safer location ooh no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm going to put it on the noct to a hoodies there you go are those part of the auction for later they are sick shout out NOA for providing those uh chewy do you want to hit me with a merch message uh before we go to the merch message though the sale is pending currently on that Google bundle but it went for
"$1,290 so wait for the sale to go" through and if I guess it fails before the end of stream we'll just rerun the auction so yep we'll just then there's the roll haha got him oh oh okay but it's actually okay in this case because it's just based on the transaction not going through it is not the same thing calm down uh speaking of calming down this uh I I am a little I'm a little flustered trying to figure out how the devil this power supply goes into this just wondering that too uh okay just
have to take this out there's a plastic piece here there's a plastic trim piece of some sort here the back does the back appears to be riveted  it's got to be the front I think it's the oh yeah yeah yeah no I think I see a slider on the basement so we just have to open whoa do that do hello buddy um I have no idea what to open I don't know   to store extra screws for your PC yeah  storage handy um I I think you want to undo this screw too uh no I don't think so I think that's for this bracket cuz I
want I think I want this to slide well that was bound to happen um no instructions are no we're not checking the instructions well you guys this is half the fun you guys want to do Au while we fig it out yeah I'd love to do an auction all right we have a pulsar bundle the Pulsar Mouse I think it's the Pulsar X2 apparently there's only 1500 of these and then we also of the random Frank P edition of oh I see of the random Frank P edition and then we also have this giant Frank P glass Edition
mouse pad that it can go with you should show them it there's only three of these in existence W So Random Frank P has one Pulsar has one and we had one and now you can have it so if we look at that W matches the color wave sweet and the auction is live auction's live go for it that's sick we'll pack it up yeah I have made some progress Alex the back of the basement now appears to be free the front appears to still be secured by something I suspect it may be on the bottom so uh yeah if I tip this
is that going to be a problem you got it uh one sec I believe yeah there we go  filter okay what do you do okay I give up someone can check the manual this is hilariously difficult to remove um are you sure it's not just this screw right here that I said we should take out yeah yeah yeah I'm really sure that not attached to it just take that screw out see what happens but look it's on here whenever I don't know how to take something apart I just look at screws that I can find and take them  
happy ha well what the heck how did that secure that now hold on on a second hold on a second can I have  sense thisll actually this is not  that what the Sam H oh this ah sits in here so even though this screw goes into this radiator bracket and has nothing to do with this it holds this in place with prevents this from I'm sure there was probably an easier way to do this um but anyway I can put the power supply in now which is well oh this auction by the way $41 the the offer is still pending uh make sure
you guys verify your bank information apparently that can help with the offer pending after you complete the auction but $41 for The Mouse and the glass mous pad so thank you very much fantastic all right let's jeez let's get this power supply in here going hold the pieces of all the trim pieces oh my goodness okay next time we do one of these because we would genuinely love to do this kind of thing more often next time we do one of these we may want to go with simpler computers
guys just saying just an idea just a concept for us to for us to chew on for us to Noodle on a little bit if Asus says that they're going to send us the fastest computer do you want  no that would be a disservice to the  Colin you send the guy away for a screwdriver and he comes back with an  China oh wait oh no he got he got screwdrivers too excellent excellent see I told you guys this is why we like him so much um we've got prototypes of our upcoming fixed shaft screwdrivers a lot
of aspects of these are not final so you're not going to look too closely at them right now but basically they're meant to be kind of a a simple just a screwdriver screwdriver except we've got some cool ideas around uh maybe making the cool so that can reach now uh maybe making the shafts configurable at the time of ordering not interchangeable after because that would add the same kind of play that you get in a uh in a multi-bit screwdriver and a lot of the people going for a fixed shaft
screwdriver they're not after that so you want like a really um you want a really solid fit here um what else was it that we were adding we have like a we have some pretty cool ideas for how to do the labels on the top so that they all have kind of a cool matching aesthetic but even if you configure them with a different thing we can easily kind of pop it in make it kind of modular from a from a manufacturing standpoint but just you know really good product really affordable got some ideas uh where did
the graphics card go there it is all right well Linus looks for a graphics card NHD 155 knock to a bundle with three fans as well it says right here the goat of CPU coolers all right um but what if I want just this well those are only fans oh right we don't have to count no no no we're not streaming there uh so nhd15 the auction is going to go live right now it's already live oh it's already live perfect wait we're not supposed to to be on only fans right now are we I mean you can be on your personal one I 
Dan uh oh I guess now's a good time for us to take a short break and tell you guys about what we're freaking raising money for uh can I get that can I get that um yes yes the digital La thing how ironic to for winning the knock to a bundle at $300 woo $300 thank you fantastic how ironic that we're promoting the BC Children's digital lab with this very analog print out of the talking points for it so uh BC Children's Hospital in general provides specialized pediatric care for children
in BC and the Yukon and the digital lab specifically does research and projects to assist children while undergoing care so they've got a ton of research projects underway uh they're using VR as a distraction while the patient under goes a painful procedure for example so that might mean while a child has to have a cast removed or blood drawn or get burn dressing um or get their burn dressing changed they're seeing an immersive story or a game in VR this has apparently been proven to be very
effective at reducing pain that's super cool uh VR has also been useful for giving virtual tours of the MRI machine so the patient has already been in the room and learned about the machine long before they actually need to go in for a scan I mean the fear is a fear management is a big thing when you're treating children uh 3D printing has been incredibly useful um from a CT scan there able to print out oh that's so cool an exact model of the patient's heart for the surgeon to practice the
procedure on the child's specific anatomy and to show the kid and parents exactly what they'll be doing during the surgery and 3D printing has also been incredibly useful for creating surgical guides by 3D scanning a patient it's possible to create 3D printed jigs to perfectly Landmark Cuts or drilling locations during surgery so in 2023 over "999,000 kids visited BC Children's" Hospital for Specialized Care and you guys donating today we'll help them continue to do that um also if you don't
want to you know buy something and you just want to donate a small amount we're going to have a link down below for where you can donate um please please do give generously it's a really good cause these guys have been around for a long time and they're doing absolutely incredible work over there all righted $50 on our B Children's Hospital page just for the the virtual fundraising page oh we raised we've raised $550 just on the BC Children's Hospital page that we set up down below
just through donations down below that's fantastic man I can't believe how generous everyone's been yeah this has been awesome Yep you know what you know when I first pitched this build concept or this uh stream concept it was three years ago it's been a long time in the making I came up with the title first so many YouTube videos are born from a title I was like we should do a stream I will build you a PC right now and to get all the ducks in a row um to get everyone on board to get a solution
where we can actually auction the things without dealing with a ton of fraudulent bids and stuff like that um has taken some arranging but I'm really glad we finally did it and I'm glad we ended up going with this iteration because like the original ones um we were just going to like buy parts from the store and we were just going to be selling them and I was like oh you know how are we going to handle the support for these systems like there were just a lot of there were
a lot of questions it wasn't really the building of computers and the streaming that was the challenge it was figuring out the sort of the business Logistics and making the whole thing make sense that was a challenge and oh my goodness sometimes building a computer can be a challenge this is a triple slot card but um I didn't realize I don't actually need the I actually well I guess I can just leave the PCI cover removed hey Alex yeah would you want the PCI cover there knowing that it impedes air flow a
little bit but looks more clean aesthetically or would you want it like that I'd want it like that okay well no I'd want it there okay let's let float plane judge guys have a look sorry Alex I got to move this a bit can I give it a shovel of okay so this is the slot that's not in so you can see the shroud of the card when I put the slot in place it's going to impede airf flow a little bit but realistically this is a card that has outstanding cooling already anyway so I don't think you're going to
need that extra little bit case exhaust so let me know do you want the card to come out you want me to put this in or do you want me to leave it the way that it is I think put wow they are split pretty much down the middle it looks like the end have it though all right fine all right oh do do you remember with this card where we went to make black and white water bottle we're going to be auctioning another one off we're going to get him to sign it in the gold  and this is what happens when you don't
have a magnetic tip screwdriver and your chassis has a thing impeding access to the man I should have left it that screw went straight into the power supply Alex oh dear yep I'm pretty uh I'm pretty unhappy right now that's really unfortunate that's uh we're going to be here all night not a good time I mean it's for the kids is the realistically what were you going to do anyway stream you're streaming already we got you valid valid yeah well it didn't fall into the GPU oh good I haven't screwed the power
supply in yet well that saves us at least a little bit of effort did it go nice I am so glad that's never been plugged in yep me too let's put this stupid slot cover back in uh chewy do you have any merch messages for us sure all right hit me when am I getting a case for my LTT screen screwdriver and stubby with all my bits I was told in progress last year but I haven't seen or heard anything I use my screwdriver daily okay so about that um our case for the bits is coming
along nicely we've got a cool little magnetic case that you can kind of put a bunch of bits in and put anywhere you want uh really happy with that how that one's coming along I think we're moving to um testing molds on that one either now or very shortly as for a case for the screwdriver I think I'm just going to do a I think  uh it's sold for 280 oh hey lus is this what you're talking about right now no oh okay but that's really cool and I'll show that too um $286 the water bottle awesome nice thank
you rido um for a case for the screwdriver there's been an incredible amount of third- party support for our screwdriver and if you go on on like 3D printing marketplaces and stuff like that there are a ton of cases that you can buy design files for you can buy the entire case Itself pre-printed by someone else you can just uh download design files as a starting point and make any modifications that you want if you're comfortable with that there's a lot of different options and I think
that given how far away we are from having our own first party case that's the direction that I'd like to point you um because a we're going to be slow and be uh I think it's really cool the way that the community has kind of jumped up to provide support for you know an accessory ecosystem for a screwdriver just based on their you know their passion for LT and their love of the product it's something that I couldn't possibly have anticipated I mean I definitely had Pie in the Sky
conversations with Alex about how you know oh yeah if this goes well man this could be like the best screwdriver and like we could like in the long term man we could have a whole line of like PC Building but like also really good tools and all the stuff Alex do you think in my wildest dreams I could have expected there to be a community of people designing accessories for our product uh that yes how many we have sold I don't think so wait did we talk about third party accessories in the early days I
don't think so I don't think we even thought about it once I didn't see it coming that's for sure it's been very cool speaking of screwdrivers where does my S I mean Retro One keep going sorry sorry uh let that slip this is the Retro color way of the LT screwdriver not to be confused with uh any um legally fraught other names that someone might use to describe it uh let's screw this power supply in if you get us sued by Nintendo I swear look if I'm going get us sued by Nintendo it's going to be doing 
tournament I don't think that's going to happen by the way I don't think uh I have been advised well I have been advised that this is a company where other people are in the leadership team and other people rely on it for things like food um and they would very much like it to exist and I have been asked respectfully not to do that that's no fun I know I missed the old lius yeah well the old lius probably was not long for this world based on that kind of Reckless Behavior so fair enough but you
know what the old lius when he was in charge designed the backpack I mean CW designed it actually this was this was very much a Miss Bridget Bergman project she brought me an initial version that I was basically like well it's not what I would have made but she knew that because I basically told her I thought it would be impossible for us to make a backpack I was like that's not what I would have made but you've gotten way closer than I would have thought was possible already
so okay green light let's make it well we're going to be auctioning off I think we have 10 of these yes 10 of these today they're all about 250 us and we're going to start the first one right now so yeah do I sign it you can sure pen we multiple pens around gold or silver look at this build you guys is that sick or what that's very nice can't wait uh we're going to go I don't know   go thank you Elijah that's very helpful  sorry we love him he's great um you're doing great Elijah thanks bu let's go
ahead and put this facia piece back on no we're going to leave this off while we get all the power supply cables plugged in hey um all right I keep wanting you to pass me cables to plug in so we can teamwork this but everything's on that side yeah I've already done all the cables okay so can I go ahead and close up the bottom I wouldn't yet so I can go ahead and close up the bottom yeah just do it all right thank you to Crystal fire for buying the LT backpack at $441 you see the zoom in on little 
signature are you doing another one right now we can if you want all right do it let's do another one right away do another one let's go for it we'll get you to sign it too do you want to do do you want to do a fun one do you want to do the battle war one the one you you have sure actually you know what no we probably shouldn't do that one because I think I've worn this one pretty hard oh no I have a lot of hours in this one foret you give them mine mine doesn't have that many no no no no no no it's
okay it's okay we'll do brand newand brand new brand new one let's keep it simple brand new one brand new one it's already up it's already up all right it's up go for it guys yeah these auctions are going super fast because we knew we had a freaking ton of them and we were worried that if we didn't stay on top of it we were not going to get through everything well right now we're actually on Pace to be out of items before you guys are done the five computers well that's good then
yeah so you guys need to speed up a little bit um oh I see yeah well um nothing that I'm doing right now is going to help with that because I went and I put the facial piece on without putting the basement in okay I guess well backpack number two sold for 501 501 yeah wow sir I'm going to butcher this sir Leia sir Lee thank you very much that one went through we're good okay basement's on oh my goodness that looks freaking awesome worth the effort someone just asked when the computer
goes up uh the computers go up for auction when we are done building the computer so you have a little bit of time if you're trying to get ready to bid on this first computer yeah if you guys want a computer now's a good time to get authenticated um on the site we've got the auction site linked down below so you're going to want to get authenticated they do need identification this is in order to prevent fraudulent bids um it does only take like 2 three minutes but at the same time we're not super
far are we not we seem super far Alex we seem we seem a little ways off but also you should go and just get get registered right now yeah just in case you see something you like we haven't even told you guys a ton of the stuff that we're going to be functioning yet uh yeah we're almost out of stuff for this build though oh we we have an SSD we what I already put an SSD in it what no for someone to just get oh sure hey Elijah ah yes do you want to auction this guy of course I do I have
so much fun auctioning uh sabrin 4 plus 4 tbte mvme SSD thank you so much Sab for sending one of these over oh man these things are sweet they're coming in a nice little carrying case too I like the carrying case we're going to start the auction right now for you guys um watch me drop oh no that's my  drive all right I also found out that the Pulsar mouse pad and Mouse um we're going to have we were not authorized to give them away uh no the man was uh banned who bid on it so we're we're
going to put that back up at some point just as a heads up everyone okay uh but yeah same with the I think we're still waiting on the Google bundle and the laptop there's going to be a couple things that are going to ultimately end up getting rerolled so that that's okay it just comes down to the authentication on the auction site so we want to make sure that's a big part of the reason that it took us so long to put this together was we were trying to find a platform that could weed out any bids
that we're not going to go through so that we can make sure that the stuff actually gets auction and actually goes to people who are contributing to the charity instead of just being a bunch of meme jokesters Chase did this sell yep oh no it's the auction just ended so it's Christopher pc90 just won for $561 $561 thank you Christopher y um Alex do we have a thing you know the kind of thing with the pictures on it thing monitor that's the one yes it's right over there fantastic grab it no no no no there's no
hurry I mean we're not there yet so um Elijah if you want to take a little break from auctioning and un  well thank you working on it I'll show the people the uh the Prototype case for our Precision screwdriver kit ahh this is injection molded now so you can tell things are getting a little closer and it's a plastic case we're not auctioning that huh oh it's a plastic case wow okay no no no no no okay okay okay okay okay hold on hold on now though it actually does have cool
features this is cool the hinge comes off little something like that okay so there's magnets here to kind of help guide it into position then you slide it and lock it ah pretty cool okay the top has these flat style magnets uh I think these are pre-prod so ignore these uh they're going to be reasonably strong but you know as strong as you can get in the flat style magnets uh it's uh hold on a second there you go okay the parts tray is magnetic and sits under the screwdriver bit and screwdriver holder
tray ah okay all right so a little cooler than just a plastic case but um yeah we're pretty actually pretty close on this one the very first sample is pretty darn good like the fit and finish of everything is like kind of Stellar actually like the magnetic holding strength is really good so we're we're we're really happy with this one should be eventually oh what can I do for you oh of course that makes sense uh thank you Colin you're doing great well don't look sad that's a compliment don't worry about it
just it's fine okay  uh yeah freaking awesome wait did I just steal someone screwdriver nope good uh this was for the case oh nice so I'm going to uh what is this supposed to hold this looks very specific this looks like it's supposed to hold a little like it actually looks like it's supposed to hold like a screwdriver Alex just handed this to me I'm assuming it's cuz he wants me to Cate knct to a hoodie how many do of these do we have we have six of them six no we have nine we have um three mediums
three largest and three xl's ah okay this is an XL so three mediums three largest three XLS it's live and here we go it's live go bid go get it they're really comfy actually they gave them out to a bunch of internal employees here and it's great I figured it out it does hold a screwdriver this bloody case came with the screwdriver I needed to access those deep recessed things I didn't even need to go get the anyway doesn't matter the point is it goes there there fine uh do you have any other screws for
the case cuz I can put them in this little screw holder there's some you know what I'm actually not going to do that because for shipping it would be nicer to just have them in that box sure cuz if they come if this comes open and then the screws all like bang around inside the case it's going to be it's going to be a pretty bad time okay so these are pieces of the cooler box Elijah where' Elijah go uh cooler the case excess oh I see there we go okay are we ready to fire this thing
up I think so what are the odds it works yes uh-huh I see have we pre-tested any  stream I see wouldn't that be embarrassing um but look at how many items there are there was so much work do you think we had time for that yeah no that's fair no that's 100% fair and valid uh were you going to plug in the front USBC I plugged in one of them and the other one it seems like you just can't oh okay well that makes sense sure thank you to lius krom for winning the NOC to a hoodie at $31 $31 for the knock to a
hoodie dang we should stock nocta hoodies on the store apparently they're very very worth a lot where's my where's my screwdriver uh Stephen do you want to hit us with a merch message we hi lonus in the gang if you could snap your fingers and put one piece of technology into the hands of everyone on the planet what would you pick and why oh man I'm going to go for the cop out answer and you guys are going to be like oh that's such a lame answer but the answer is the internet uh the
internet is such a tool for um economic Mobility like socioeconomic Mobility it is such a tool for knowledge and change um like any tool it can be used for um for Bad actors to do to do harm but um I think it is I I shouldn't say I think I think it's I think it's pretty clear that it's the most world changing Innovation from the last at least you know okay I don't want to go back to 50 years cuz then we're getting dangerously close to the beginning of mic aluminum but it's a big flipping deal and uh a
shocking number of people worldwide still do not have internet access so if I could get anything into everybody's hands that would be it the the gamer sort of you know YouTuber answer I don't know I guess it'd be cool if everyone had a you know um a big screen Beyond you know what they could watch they could watch movies this big in their bathroom look I gave a real answer I think it's okay if my answer is stupid like at least like a decent gaming   they're yeah somebody took the batteries  [Applause]
someone else talking ah do I want to auction something let's figure out what else auction H do we have another hoodie we do yeah let's do another hoodie let me go grab another hoodie let's do what size should we do this time let's do a large same knock to a hoodie as before it's just large now the auction starting right now hold on we got to model it though oh we'll model it while the auction's gone okay here we go perfect hold on clear me a catwalk oh wow thanks you need to show off the
tassels they're like the best tassels of any sweater well have you seen our new ones yet I have not but I don't know if you can beat that okay they're pretty cool okay our new ones are pretty cool though uh hey Colin can you get our new draw okay this black uh Creator Warehouse Creator Warehouse yeah other building okay anyway not to a hoodie so it's got a super loose kind of comfy fit and the uh well you called them tassels no it's not working I'm trying but it's really not
working it's a it's a brushed uh brushed interior so if you're not into the whole French terry finish and it's got that that that super super soft feel and thumb holes what' you call me and thank you to the winner foni I hope I pronounced that right for uh the $261 bid thank where that came from all right uh here I guess that goes back in there now U you know how to fold clothes right did you ever work in the I just buy new clothes every time in this I use my merch budget see the thing
with him is I can't quite tell if he's serious or not sometimes he always he told me on when when did you come over uh Saturday Saturday he's like oh mango uh I've never tried mango never had a mango before and I'm sitting here going well eat some mango he like is it good by the way mango it was delicious nobody needs your review of mangoes everyone knows what mangoes are James made fun of me CU I didn't  either how did you where have you lived I don't know I don't understand this man
he's an actual grown adult who that I need I need a drink this is definitely water I have some start this is this is a ready to go I okay want to do the honors let's do it hit it Elijah W look at the RGB in the front wow okay and you didn't even see all the RGB on the inside look at this whole RGB panel here okay it's that's really cool how much is this case oh the case I don't no we had the whole build which was yeah but we had the wrong case on it oh I see so we don't actually know here
check out the front Andy this looks sick so we're going to be auctioning this very soon right Chase just a recap for those of you who are joining us now this is a 14900 K I believe it it's 48 gigs of RAM right yes 48 8200 megat transfers per second we see if that works special LTT Edition Ram from Manta uh or sorry um yeah manta's the brand right yep uh we've got an Rog z790 whatever exactly one it is but the back to front one so the cable management in this build is immaculate as long as you look at it
"from this side RTX 490 1,00 watt 80 plus" if I recall correctly this is 80 plus titanium rated or is it Platinum it's Platinum um this is super good power supply though uh what else we got in here triple 120 mm AO cooler up in the top and we've got a 4 tbte Sabin rocket plus Drive in now one of the slots somewhere apparently this case is $500 yeah that checks out so this build's uh this auction is going to be a little bit different it's going to start at "$1,337 and we're going to start it for 5"
minutes give you a little bit more time to get it so okay our value of this PC is $ "5,532 57 and massive shout out all the" partners Who provided the hardware for this um auction live all for a good cause the auction is now live um are we going to see if that Ram is going to do 8200 because I have my doubts uh I decided not to do that because the last time that we did that on a stream it crashed while the GPU drivers were installing and then it was a whole thing cool so we're going to get the GPU
drivers installed why don't I leave you here to get this kind of going and then I can start build number two sure does that work yeah all right cool I'm just going to take my laptop there's one thing that we didn't auction from up here oh sure oh wait but we're watching this PC so yeah we got an auction live right now okay perfect all right oh yeah I love this thing it's a wallboard it's a power bank I will bring it over here cuz my laptop died before the stream started and I needed to I needed
to have one okay where's my tools at here it is guys build number two also a Seuss but this time a little bit less gamery a little bit more professionally it's the pro art build and the total  .73 a little more professional but can it still game like a hot Dam absolutely friends it's got an RTX 480 and at its core we've got an Intel 14900 K okay it's not a KS it doesn't go to 6.2 gahz turbo but it does what is it six or 6.1 yes six that's 6 gz so I think you'll probably get over it also 
cooler I'll wait till you spot it this thing is smoking well then it's not cooling very well it's on fire no it's it's cool smoke you know oh there's smoke and then there's like cool smoke like vaping oh that's a joke in all seriousness uh we do not we do not promote any consumption of addictive substances on this channel that is not we do not work with brands that promote addictive substances just want to make that abundantly I'm sorry we are joking we are joking um let's go
ahead and not joke about that anymore  sir told you once I told you 100 times not yes sir you're killing me Elijah yes what what would you prefer oh my God you guys would you how minus Master oh Chancellor lius Chancellor leader Admiral Vision ah here it is okay Alex okay Alex yeah I know the noct ones are super cool but we were aware of the nocta ones when we developed this one and our goal here was our goal was to do something different we're not just going to we're not we're not copycats we wanted to do
something different but we wanted to do something that was at least equally cool let me know what you think of this that's pretty good okay but hold on that's pretty good oh that's pretty nice yeah ah super thick super super thick 2B even and they're they're filled they're filled so they stay they stay tuby huh and then we had custom aluminum end caps made see got the little screw in there to secure it in place with LT logos ah this this is For an upcoming hoodie um you see what I mean with Colin
he okay he brought back two other things but he brought back the right thing right great work Colin good catch okay let's go ahead and get this build going I am going to try and keep this a little bit more organized maybe Elijah could do me a solid or Alex and we could get a bin for the parts we've got a bin right but that bin is full oh I'll get you another one but I may have have a pin for the stuff that I'm sir working on thank you so much let me see if I can get this motherboard out of the out of 
start you're doing great we're currently "at $6,000 for the PC how much 6,000 is" that what we're at so far or completed 30 seconds left 30 seconds left we're at "$6,000 for the gaming PC absolutely" incredible am I going to need one of these m.2 mounting M jigs um um no I don't think I will okay perfect uh where  this yeah don't worry about it no no one no one answer that's fine oh yep I'm watching is it almost is it almost up oh no it's 10 seconds again 10 oh someone "bid again y 6,100 I think"
get50 6150 things are getting pretty heated on the game let's get the Creator py going here so I already told you guys we've got a 14900 6200 all right uh you know what fine just cut just cut to Dan Dan you're in charge I'm my Mone oh can we see "6,300 oh sold for 6200 to uh archin 116" I hope I said that right 116 but it's pending so we'll have to wait and see on that one all right it is a lot of money thank you very much in advance that is pending and then does it just fall back
to the previous bid if it's pending or do we have to auction it again uh we'll we'll see about that all right we're going to figure that out this is our first time doing this honestly all things considered is going pretty smoothly I think we have to wait a little bit to make sure that they can go through the transaction and then we might just have to re auction it near the end exciting next up our Pro art machine so let's go ahead and get our storage installed here we've gone with
the same rocket 4 plus I mean it has all the same benefits here 4 tabt massive capacity super fast drive it's pcie Gen 4 this time I'm going to install it in the correct slot actually no I'm not because I believe the top slot on this one is a gen five slot so if that's the case then I should put this one in a Gen 4 slot anyway uh PCI Gen 5 by 16 slots blah blah blah storage blah blah nope they're all Gen 4 on this board in that case I'm going to put it on the CPU slot
so that's the top one here oh do we want to uh auction off a pulsar X2 random Frank P edition these mice are great so this is one of "1,500 56 G kale GM 8.0 switches and a" TTC gold encoder and also this mouse is so good that after the review of it I bought one myself it's very rare that I do that it's live yeah you're not pleas it's live I have done that for this mouse and the Dyson vacuum I I'm sad to say I also bought one of those I think Dyson probably made back okay not all of it but a substantial
amount of their money on that sponsorship they did on that stupid stick vacuum on our staff and our business alone we own two of them corporately I own two one that I bought for my in-laws one for myself you bought one you bought one you bought one too when I was thank you to Hut for winning the Pulsar Mouse uh $224 excellent awesome thank you very much for your generosity uh okay Andy here we're getting an SSD install we might as well take a closer look at the hardware it's proart so it's
you know still a super high-end board but it's got a little bit more of a mature design to it it'll game with the best of them though do you want to take a second to show off our running gaming computer oh are you guys done already yeah I not going to lie don't take this the wrong way I was not expecting that to be working so quickly I mean I mean good job here we go oh we got a game running already everything game running flip an a all right happening this is not normal yeah
this man this never happens on a stream we haven't even overclocked the ram yet and you're still at 500 FPS well yeah of course I mean it's a 4090 and a 14900 KS  stupid and is am you know my system at home is pretty good like I have a pretty good system but what I don't have is a super high refresh rate monitor it's ah so good yeah no monitor included by the way though guys yeah just so that you are aware shoot I don't know how to change the weapon oh you're de okay anyway that's fine basically
we've is that GPU at 41° well this is the same GPU do you remember that stupid video that we made where that stupid video we made really Alex are you going to narrow it down at all the one where we put a computer in the environmental chamber and we were like we're going to run a game and drop the temperatures and watch the speed of the GPU go up and we had this GPU in there and I remember and then we turned the temperature up and it still wouldn't slow down yeah we we increased it and
you have to go to like 80° ambient for the thing to even start thermal throttling it's insane yeah it's a pretty crazy I don't know if it was 80 was it it couldn't I don't think we went that high we went pretty high well whatever in the video we'll have the exact numbers but yeah this thing it's barely even warm to the touch this is stupid and yes okay technically it was it was not actually rendering that much there but that still yeah anyway those are really good coolers congratulations assuming the
transaction goes through if it doesn't then we'll we'll hit it again but sick system let's build another one all right I'm going to build this one a little bit faster chewy you want to hit me with a merch message I've got the SSD installed already this is going to take no time at all here we go Elijah are you able to get the case prepped for me sir uh sure also do we have ai coolers for all of them uh uh yeah let's get this no comment you have help you can get other people to help you build Linus yeah but
that's not the title of the video the title of the video is I will build a PC for you right now oh my God we've got  and gigabyte I've kind of figured it out over the years but Corsair was one of the early ones that was like I'm sorry why do computers have to be ugly you know yeah they just they figured it out also just in general huge thanks to Corsair huge thanks to Asus without those two this would not be a stream today so thank you very very much yeah I really appreciate you guys shout out
what not the auction platform that we're using for waving their fees all the proceeds today are going to BC Children's Hospital um specifically um hold on a second yeah all the proceeds are going to BC Children's Hospital I need to clear space um oh my goodness okay right there's good wait oh U are you able to take it out of the case or the the box or oh wait what's this this is the case what is happening right now this is an auction that's a pre-built this is not a pre-built this
is just a case no computer in here only a case but it is the HP Omen 45 L ATX this thing right here has two cooling zones yeah so up here you have your radiator in here you have your computer so you're not mixing the heat with the different stuff in here should we go chase yep we're going Wicked wait no I know the story behind this I don't think this has ever been opened because we reviewed the system and we were upset about some of the proprietary Ville aspects of the system and then I think
HP was mad and they were like well I don't think you guys were that fair to the case and we were like right but we weren't reviewing the case we were reviewing the system it's not available as just a case yet and they were like okay well we'll send you the case does that sound does that ring a bell that does ring a bell but they didn't send us a case until now oh so they have the case now and the case is actually really good the case is the case is super cool it was the system itself that had like a
proprietary motherboard or something like that and it it did the thing remember that issue that we've had with HP and secret shopper in the past sometimes where they don't turbo as much as the other brands because they actually stay in Intel spec which is not a bad thing but it's not a performant thing and so we talked about that in the review I think that's what they I think that's what they were upset about we were like okay well you know it is what it is um anyway the case itself super
cool and it's weird to me but I think also really cool that HP is willing to sell the thing separate because I remember as a young Enthusiast wanting an Alienware case back in the day calling Alienware going I will pay you basically anything for this like Star Wars uh edition of your case and they were like well how about buying a computer and I was like no I can I can I can build a computer I can't I can't art though can you please just sell me the just sell me the case
and they were like no um so I think it's super cool that if HP is going to put all the work into innovating and building this super cool case that they actually make it available for sale all right let's get this installed here do you have the screws for this case oh does that look sick or what Andy oh yeah thank you to bronzy for the HP Omen uh winning the bid at uh 650 65050 pending so it we'll come back around if it doesn't go through eventually but looks good what's our uh what's our running
total so far you guys "6,260 we've raised over $6,000 and" that's not including pending ones that "system itself went for 6,000 we just" need to see it actually go to completion first all right let's get our boot drive here so this is our this is our hack uhhuh this is just one of our standard test bench drives that hopefully is not going to have any compatibility issues as we move it around from system to system I mean are they all Intel platforms today there's one AMD and we
think we will have problems when we get there but that's a problem for I don't know 500 PM us neat to be clear we're not saying AMD has problems we're just saying that when you put a drive that has Intel drivers on it um on an AMD platform you're asking for problems all right and if we don't have problems then then when we take it out of that and put it in our last Intel build we probably have problems okay well that might be an order of operations uh um question but that's okay realistically we had a lot
come together today and I'm surprised things are going as well as they are well guess the front of that's not coming out oh you found oh good you found screws yeah well that's helpful man how did Asus go from absolutely nobody in the case space to these are kind of sick yeah this is an awesome case look at the size of those fans this looks great they've got the little uh nubbin for holding the drive in place while you uh carefully supervise it to make sure it doesn't fall out and then
screw it in um they've got these really awesome looking GPU support braces here like man look at that thing that is robust they've got um this size of screw for the so I'm going to go ahead and yeah I'm going to go ahead and use this instead of that first one that's weird cuz I thought they were 632 on the other case nope they are definitely MC all right good to know um chewy want to hit me with a merch message absolutely what would be the best device for watching movies um arvr do you think
arvr will replace a TV or monitors in  ah so the best device for watching movies well it's going to depend what kind of movies right like apple Vision Pro it's got the best display that I've yet seen it's it's incredible it's just it's just outstanding however they are struggling or have decided not to support some of the more common stereo 3D playback formats um so if you don't have a a spatial video the Apple Vision Pro may not be as smooth to get working at the very least compared to a more PC
oriented headset or uh something like a quest 3 however assuming perfect compatibility I know what screen I would rather watch a movie on and that's definitely the Apple Vision Pro and my hope is that in time we're going to see that screen technology or very similar make its way to a more PC or Open Standards oriented headset and that's going to be um and that's going to be possible to achieve on outside of Apple's ecosystem as it is now I got to tell you I'm honestly just
not into it I have a I don't remember the last time I watched a movie by myself and if I did watch a movie by myself um there's no way I would be that into having a a thing on my face so your question of will head mounted display movie watching be a thing will it take off the answer is absolutely of course it will it's already a huge thing for certain people like uh Jake bellance for example here is like yeah man I watch movies on my VR headset all the time I sit on the couch I watch movie on a
giant screen um and people who travel a lot you know I can definitely see the benefit there if you're sitting on a plane you're not exactly going to be able to you know bring a giant TV with you but I um I just can't say that I'm personally that into it um but yeah will it be a thing absolutely it's already a thing now it's just a matter of will it be a mainstream thing and to answer that I mean you're the only one who can answer that when are they going to be small enough and light enough for you
right now if all you want is a screen that sits in front of your face there's actually some pretty small and light stuff I remember back when I was still working at NC uh we carried this brand called vsix that I was floored to discover totally still exists and is still making just like glasses style head-mounted displays there's a ton of companies that do that these days and I have to assume that if they've existed for this long and have the broad product range that they have that some people
are super into it which I guess is super cool it's just not really my jam speaking of jam how about Space Jam oh Space Jam what you should take a look at this this is flipping sick okay hold on a second clear off some space for you it is amazing you're joking really be careful be careful X3 Xbox limited edition Space Jam controllers with LeBron James fig where's the devil did we get are we allowed to bid Xbox Canada thank you Xbox Canada Xbox Canada wow Bugs Bunny signed Xbox game pass
card I'm so excited I want to see it okay let's open it I assume that these are all going to come falling out if I open it wrong you can keep it stacked up like this oh wow okay oh  wow okay come check this out come check this out Andy okay this one is freaking incredible I love it Doom Squad I might love this one even more tun Squad oh that's so fun though LeBron James figurine okay got some batteries that's fun um LeBron James tun Squad figurine they look so serious so handsome and Bugs Bunny it's
graded oh my God Bugs Bunny card uh comes with 12 months of Game Pass ultimate and guess what the auction starts right now and the auction starts right now no you're not allowed to bid why because this is for the people but what it but what if he is the people please no Dan uh where's our cooler for this boy uh that's a good question all right let's get nice here you go front USBC got 740 see 750 very shortly uh Hey Elijah if you want to extract all the accessories we need and nothing else I think that'll
really go a long way toward us um not creating so much chaos sure I could do that uh maybe over there would be perfect or yeah that perfect thank you all right let's get all this wired up as best we can you know what Alex can I take the 12vt high power and maybe come up and under sure thank you to graceful Ms for their second auction win today with the uh Space Jam controllers what did that go for $761 heck yeah kind of a steal yeah I yeah those are those are pretty cool they're pretty sweet they're they're
really nice not going to lie um this is one of my dumbest impulse purchases ever I paid more than that per controller price like if we assume each of those was like 250 bucks each or whatever it works out to for um one of the Xbox team um I didn't I didn't even get yeah so so the people who worked on the Xbox series X got these like special controllers and a couple of them have ended up on eBay I've seen like yeah so like honestly these are pretty unique item I would for that price I think
that's I don't even know how many of them there are like do we know how many packages of those that bundle exist that's just a press kit that's just a press kit okay press kit bundle all right there you go a quick shout out on the BC Children's Hospital page uh on the in the link on the YouTube video and our other platforms uh we're at "$995 uh out of our $5,000 goal so we're" just $5 away from a th heck yeah yeah go down and donate to BC Children's Hospital uh we're specifically uh
supporting the digital lab team yes the digital lab yeah go check it out also should we uh auction off this Ram sure so this right here is 128 GB of 3200 megat transfer per second ddr4 now uh there was a goof and this was supposed to be ddr5 for one of our builds but uh it arrived as ddr4 so we are auction it off instead this would go for $550 brand new if you have am4 maybe you want to get this keep your PC going on for a little bit longer yeah starts now yeah Starts Now
fantastic there was a goof a nice well hey that worked out in your what what is what's the Monopoly card there was a bank error in your favor collect $15 or what is up with those cards in Monopoly where it's just like a completely meaningless amount of money you're like "oh great well I just spent you know ,000" on rent at Boardwalk or you know whatever it is like oh thank you for the $10 overdraft error in my favor I hate that game too much like real life all right let's get these plugged
in more conventional build here so everything is front to back which honestly not going to lie little bit easier when I'm don't need to be thinking while I'm also trying to host a video uh Julie do you want to hit me with a merch message I feel like I've asked you that a bunch of times and then we've just like cut you off every time yeah I got one just got my custom wormwood desk and can't wait to add all this new cable management to it after the AMD upgrade has anyone looked into a possible collab with
warmwood um I'm going to confess as far as I'm aware we haven't but um I don't know I I have I have no idea what that would look like to be honest with you I mean we're always we're always down for ideas but it's one of those things where even though their products are expensive being as Boutique PE as they are what I suspect is that their margins are not necessarily as high as you might think because there's a lot of overhead involved in running a business and I suspect that their volumes aren't crazy
high so I think the last thing that they would want to do and the last thing that we would want to ask them to do is just like split their margin and add some kind of arbitrary influence or tax um so I don't know uh hey all the front panel connectors are plugged in so cool uh how and the power supply is wired up do you want to talk about that I would love nothing more actually what do we got for our power supply for this one oh all right Corsair hx1000i uh this oh wow cybernetics
Platinum so I don't know if you guys are familiar with them but cybernetics does power supply testing and it's in our opinion a more meaningful evaluation not just of the power supplies efficiency but also its overall performance um they run it through a whole Suite of tests rather than just evaluating power in compared to power out ac across a range of outputs and earning a cinetics platinum certification is like actually pretty meaningful it's fully modular it's hidden in the
basement of the cas oh no here it is I I don't know how to get it in actually nope it's it's stuck where it is well whatever here's the Box T thank you very much Corsair for sending this over a little delayed announcement here but thank you to Guardian comics for winning the Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB 120 GB Ram kit at $690 awesome fantastic amazing nice thank you very much oh yeah nice nice we we have to auction things off we're doing this build too fast Alex I've got a question when do you want
Sarah over here what when do you want Sarah over here oh you can bring over over now okay oh man you get to yell a little louder okay have to remove a basement shroud again we do yes I can do that but do you want to talk about this oh I guess okay so I I forget what stupid conversation spawned this monstrosity but we were having conversations about the stubby screwdriver in the early days of development as you guys may know what we ended up with was a stubby screwdriver with a super short shaft this is the
final product with nerling on it so you can kind of you know put screws in or you know drive them with the handle like you normally would half the bit storage of the regular one yada y y y yada you guys know the drill then we were planning a shaft extension for the main driver and we thought oh wow actually that works really great with the stubby you could have a longer shaft on the stubby but there's always going to be a little bit of play in that because manufacturing tolerances are not perfect
and in order to make sure that every one of these fits in every one of these this is always going to have to be a little on the smaller side this is always going to have to be a little on the bigger side you're going to have a little bit of flop so someone on the team I can't remember who was like oh well what if we put a fulls siize shaft no wait that's an extra long shaft longer shaft on the screw l so we made a compensator stubby um anywh who this is a it's live this is
a oneoff the auction is live it comes with our standard bit set and uh we will probably never productize this no promises I mean maybe if there's enormous demand who knows you never can say but um or the non-sa approved stubby yeah the non-sa approved stubby and to be clear we're not guaranteeing that the regular stubby will make it through TSA we're just saying that with it disassembled like this I've made it  vary uh I don't know where these go so I'm going to put them with you thank you
all right cool thanks case no worries I don't know where this bag came from I got your radiator boss oh perfect thank you Mountain gear is underneath it uh thank you there a power supply uh here you go Alex we're fighting for power supp is in go ahead and screw that back in and I'm going to get this going wow look at this monster okay it is hard to get a good sense for the scale of this thing here's my wait where's the Golden Banana oh I'll grab it yes man been useful good time to say thank you
to reversin nator for winning the non-sa approved stubby screwdriver at $421 oh nice plus one so there's a banana for scale look at the flipping size of this it's triple 140 mil so these fans oh this was the collab with knock 2011 so it has knock to a fans it's going to be this computer is going to be so quiet oh yeah it's got an OCTA Edition GPU we'll get to that in a little bit anyway it oh my God is this going to fit uh-oh did anyone check someone validated this with the Seuss
before we uh before we were all like hey let's do this right Matt says yes okay all right well good luck everybody good Lord is that ever oh balls again again not me again him I have dropped nothing oh I didn't drop it wow it didn't fall because I spring into action so how's the winter of your discontent now you want Sumer no I want you to auction off this oh my God okay another stupid screwdriver this  wait the probably TSA approved short shaft regular screwdriver we've done some weird
prototypes okay it has the standard bit set in it so 12 bits because it's not a stubby screwdriver and it comes with our regular old shaft extension the one thing it's missing compared to a regular driver is any knurling on the shaft so it's um BYO nerling like the stubby it is less than 7 in um so theoretically you could take it on a plane but we are not guaranteeing that TSA can be quite arbitrary in the in the enforcement of their rules auction auctions live so uh thanks
chass I am going to try and figure out how to get this thing in here because this might be a problem  go yeah do we need to take the top off and screw the fans in from the top let's take it over there don't know okay that's  the they were somewhere in a different box Fascinate okay let's just have a quick looky Boo  goes what could go wrong I found Sarah oh a wild Sarah appears I was not told why Sarah is here I was just told that she would be coming here and that it would be fun okay uh
we're looking for the thing that she needs it's over there oh it's over there oh boy the stickers I don't know yeah it's the stickers where are they they're definitely in here not be the first we've hit a a significant snag let's see if we can figure out how to get this Radiator in thank you to n pixel for the $56 bid uh the winning bid on the probably TSA approved regular screwdriver seriously that's awesome love it including those pending purchases "we're at like $8,600 now or not"
including those pending purchases we at "$8,600 so Alex uh how are we doing on" pending purchases how long do we leave them pending before we auction them  everything okay okay cool stickers I'm going to double check with James thanks all right Elijah yes sir what are the odds so do you want to just over introduce it in water the odds yes okay can you for a sec yes that was a good joke though I he's proud of me you should be a writer I'm working on it I'm Junior right now um do you think we
need to take the ram out do any of these parts oh well they come out whether they  TBD uh okay that's  um I think they're yeah yeah we'll we'll we yeah we'll move the Ram uh okay Alex has something to say and Sarah has something to say computer can I help you guys did you just say computer oh I'm showing the wrong side look what it has on it oh A rad sword pixel bread sorus we have another one too even better in my opinion yeah this one's definitely  sorus and so this whole thing's going to
be sticker bombed by Sarah right here  yeah um oh God I uh hold on a second hold on a second is there a possibility that it's intended to go in front oh it's beautiful no it doesn't fit in the front either okay how sure are we that this is supposed to go in here out of 10 we are  sure there okay well it might need to go in before anything else then time to take the motherboard out what you can't like even up here I think it's like a split where the one side of like the spine and the r is
on the other oh jeez oh what's that done  oh okay what did you do how far does it go back in there I oh there's a whole like space in here that was really hard to figure out well you know what that took me seconds you know what Alex what a silly goober what do you do professionally do you know what Alex is going to talk about this mouse pad right here oh shoot the motherboard might still need to come out all right let's get going this right here is another Bob Ross M Pad but this
right here is storm on the horizon and as you can see it is very pretty this is worth $30 normally but today it's going to be worth whatever it goes for lus you should sign it and that way it'll be worth even more sure I don't have a pen oh this is good um all right I'll sign the rock now you can never say that I've never signed your  here all right so the reason this motherboard has to come out is because in order to screw in these fans we need to be where these vrms are 
okay uh chili do you want to hit us with a merch message yes hi L A DCS plus crew did you see the new commercial ready Atlas robot from B Boston Dynamics looks like that came out this morning do you think it will be as successful as spot or more or are businesses not ready to replace the humans yet oh man I'm not going to lie I just saw the news that the original Atlas had been EOL I did not see the news that they announced the replacement for it so can someone who watched it maybe answer this question
it's something else it's pretty freaky I think my toxic trait is thinking that I would be able to beat it in a fight and it would it would lay me out very quickly it's probably really easy you just like run somewhere kind of challenging and it'll get confused but have you seen the way it stands up it's I would be horrified if that thing stood up at the end of the hallway and just started walking towards me yeah Solus it's like laying down and then its legs come up around and it's Fe go right here
and then it LIF stands up and then it rotates it's horrifying it's nightmare fuel I see um well that's something I don't know I think there is some advantages though to having at least some sort of humanoid style robot if it can mean removing picking up and placing or getting into fine areas that might be difficult for fingers well the world is designed for humanoid shapes so I guess the idea is that you don't have to completely redo as as much as it's way more difficult to design a humanoid
robot if you can pull it off um there's far less redesign of your existing infrastructure in order to make it work for you this is very challenging can you shove it a little bit towards your left please also B Ross M pad went for $211 I don't know who it is but awesome stuff oh you can see it right there shout oh okay here we go oh yeah I mean sure that's not unnerving but do you know what is nerving um oh oh oh wow we've got an Rog Ally for auction with the AMD Z1 extreme
this is a 512 gig storage version so 16 gigs Ram basically this thing is flipping awesome it has a 7in 1080p screen 120 HZ refresh rate so for any games that are lightweight enough and support 120 HZ it is absolutely buttery smooth this is my daily driver handheld um gaming machine I was on the fence I was on the fence about switching to the steam deck OLED I'm sorry Elijah that's okay I was on the fence about switching to the steam deck OLED I ultimately did not I prefer the benefit of Windows and its
compatibility and yeah there's you know there's advantages and disadvantages both ways but I ended up with the Ally and I I absolutely love that thing auctions live all right auctions live for that we're adding like 15 seconds to some of these auctions people said 30 seconds was a little too quick so we're going to go for 45 for now okay thanks Chase oh boy this is this is a whole thing this okay so um new rule yes sir next time we do one of these zero aios or we can just 
then I was doing a script review with Adam today for our upcoming POV build guide we haven't done one in four years the first one has like 12 million views so I can't believe it took us this long to do anyway that's not the point the point is that he had kind of a Choose Your Own Adventure Style thing where um you we would install the air cooler on the motherboard and then we'd be like or if you have an AIO skip to this Tim stamp and then and it was a really cool idea but we ultimately killed it
because a I wanted the parts list to be something we recommend and in that "particular system it's like $1,000 price" point I yeah we're not we're not recommending an a and number two it completely bungs up the order of operations for the build so there was no way for us to show how to put the system into the case for the air cooled person without them having to sit through a bunch of AIO nonsense and there's no way to show the AO one cleanly and are we seriously auctioning
that yes it's a teaser do you want to do it right now after we announce the winner of this huge thanks to Jay Classon $922 that is awesome um let's not do it yet but you can show them you can show them want to give a little sneak peek oh that's titanium no it isn't that's titanium just the top listen to that sound just the end cap theend capap and this is aluminum and the beauty ring oh okay sound accent ring and endcap are titanium um are they heat or anodized anodized oh
yeah that is amazing okay later later we're saving that one I'm actually very surprised that we are um I'm very I'm I am surprised to see that today in this context uh no no it's fine it's good it's for BC children so no problem there I'm just uh I'm not sure what the future of that project is that may be a product at some point but it says one of one but it's maybe not one of one we'll see you certainly won't be getting it anytime soon on the store I'll tell you that much
um should we do a different auction then since you don't want to do that one I am not a fan of this sandwich style installation method not as sweaty as Alex yet but boy am I ever getting there give a time yeah I'll take that as a yes Lambo water bottle 64 Oz We're going to be auctioning it right now you guys can go get yours this is my favorite color wave I think I have four of these um sorry I wouldn't normally correct you live on stream but you've done it either two or
three times now it's color way what did I say color wave well color way Lambo Edition yes it's why I'm a junior writer not not a full writer no no no it's fine it it really doesn't matter it's just you know if I can if I well I I heard it correctly s Sarah Sarah Sarah's here I wouldn't want her to I would want her to think that you know we think it's color wave you are correct it is color way not wave can I say color wave yes you get  yes that's me uh I need to I need to get these bloody fans
in did it oh still going in the auction wow take your time how's that what are we actually the water bottle that over 230 so far oh seriously right yeah let's do that let's put it in okay can this  buddy oh I see your problem oh no oh no oh no okay oh there isn't really much room for the fan cable here so it can't sit between the fan and the frame so I don't know where the devil it's supposed to go then but it'll have to go somewhere else M Parker $251 for  much all right oh interesting are these clips for
putting a cable in I am not going to do that I am going to do it like this and that will be good enough okay I am dying I'm dying trying to install this fast no don't die we have so much more to auction off I can die tonight though when we're done yeah yeah when we're done okay thank you no one cares after uh chewy do you want to hit us with a merch message sure as game companies continue to shut down their game servers what are your thoughts on community projects to replace those game servers that's how it
should be and if the community is not big enough or motivated enough and the game ultimately dies then hey at least at least the gamers who loved that game had an opportunity to save it uh we talk about this often on the W show because it's such a prime example of how things should be done but one of my favorite games um when I was a young adult uh was Supreme Commander and what happened when gas powered games went down I can't remember if it was gas powered games or thq's demise that ultimately spurred
this but what ultimately happened with that game when it was no longer supported and they no longer had um multiplayer servers through the game developer was the community was given the opportunity to stay on as stewards of the game with the stipulation that they were only allowed to provide the service for legitimately owned copies of the game and to this day you can still buy Supreme Commander on Steam uh it comes with the expansion forg Alliance and then there's a third party a
community client called Forge Alliance forever that has matchmaking uh match replays they host tournaments it's an absolutely incredible example of what can be done with a dedicated community and a willing developer and publisher um who wants to see their game get a second life uh past the death of the um of the first party server so that's that's what we would like to see ideally I mean in a perfect world it wouldn't even be necessary because games would have the option for Community
servers baked right into them but I do understand from an anti-che and balance standpoint why you know that's not necessarily preferred um and it's extra Dev to do it both ways so I get it but at least mandating that game developers have to give up the tools if they're not going to continue to maintain them themselves would go a long way toward preventing these games from just rotting I mean I think what's going on with the crew right now is a perfect example of what a worst case scenario looks
like uh do you want to hit me with one more tree and then we'll do another auction uh I do not have any oh okay then we'll do another auction perfect let's do another auction oh well we did one of these earlier the noct nhd15 bundle three more fans as well included with this written right there again the goat of CPU coolers this one's going to go up for auction right now one oh oh sorry oh he's pulling it up never mind it's going to go up for auction now there we go okay that's what I use in my computer

probably butchered that thank you Mcllroy all right perfect Roy this come out um it's probably screwed in on the bottom Alex this is the kind of thing where if I was building this on my own time and I was taking my time and I I knew what I was doing I had time to read the manual and I wasn't streaming it would all be fine that it's all so securely screwed into place um but yeah no I suspect yeah it's scis in from the bottom for sure I can see them ah or no it's Cruis in from the top oh I see it
yep so these come out and then I got you like this hey to's credit this is a nice big hole for this so you can actually get in there with a multi-bit screwdriver there we go and it should come out now yay nice now we've got all the room we need to plug in this modular interface or plug cables into the modular interface okay that's not what I'm looking for though but I right that's what I want I want the thumb nuts uh for this AO cooler uh do I have the thumb nuts for this cooler by any chance

again so if you want a size guide for it um now is a perfect time to head to LTC store.com find the tracksuit it's a medium like that it's the same pattern we just had it dyed eye acid the lambo and green we were thinking of doing it as um as like a a pre-sale build to order thing and then we kind of went yeah I don't know the track suit's not moving really that well so forget it um maybe it's not moving that well because we didn't do that color scream who knows I bet you would have sold millions of
these no I really don't think so thank you for not working on the business and procurement team I would have been like Nick light  go he would have stopped you I don't know he's kind of my buddy yeah but he would have stopped you because he's your  here he would have saved you don't but I would have had clothes for life I yeah  sold we're at 240 right now for the tracksuit do you want to do you do do you want me to model it oh yeah you should we need lonus and Lambo all right here we

whoops I'm very jealous congratulations nerds hope you eny enjoy it okay all right let's get this fan hooked up man what a flipping I'm glad that the end result of this build is going to be awesome because it has definitely been some work there we go so throw one of those on there where's the rest of these fans I got this okay oh that's a cool little Hub yeah it's got here I'll show you this Andy let me just turn it around for you real quick here uh we've got a cute little Fan Hub no RG or anything
like that this is more of a professional product you know nice little Fan Hub here to get everything plugged into uh they have built-in Cable Management Alex is using some of it sort of I'm the one who put the 24 pin in here it's okay Minor Details Minor Details have we given any thought to how the devil we're going to ship these things probably in a package but um thank you Elijah that's  okay okay problem yeah he could do with it okay yes I'm I I believe procurement SL Logistics is on it okay as long as
someone someone is on it okay I think for most of them we're going to be actually taking if not all of them we're going to be taking the GPU out putting it in a separate box shipping these computers to you so that way they ideally don't get there in any damage shape see I told you guys he's good at things and actually thoughtful he just plays this on camera so I asked him has anyone thinking of this oh I don't know actually detailed explanation for how it's all being taken care of thank you
very much Elijah you're welcome he's very zoomed in on my face right now I can see the L sorry anyways uh whale Mouse this one again the Pulsar X2 the L wh land Edition we had five of these well where are the other ones well we sold one this is number two all right here it is and it's live whale land Mouse oh this one should be signed by Sarah cuz she's here how convenient is that the designer of the one and only whale I didn't even know this existed really yeah I want one oh sorry uh well um
oh this is terrible where do I sign it this is what happens every time I interact with a Zoomer it's not I can't help it my pen came apart in my hands where where where's the appropriate spot to sign for the bottom okay yeah but is that yeah not there yeah just like right there I mean we don't need the Pulsar logo you could just sign over top of that is hilarious watching her hold a pen I can't imagine how she writes at all and yet she Arts like no one else I know this is my pen holding
method very professional if it works if it's stupid and it works it's it's stupid and it works well TR blue J gets that Mouse for $541 $541 do you have any idea how much your signature just increase the value of this thing got yeah that's the value man when she pitched me that whale I could tell there was some hesitancy it's like I don't know but man I forget what the what were the design notes I forget well I was told to make a whale with a gold chain and then I'm sitting at my desk and
sunglasses and I'm like this has never been done before how am I supposed to make this come to life and it happened it worked I think the only notes I had was I don't know the sunglasses and then you gave me like mockups of three different sunglasses and yours were the best ones anyway and we threw them away so we ended up with basically zero changes the original whale and it has now existed in 2D form uh we've done plushies yep someone made you a knitted one recently where can people see that
did they I'll post it on Twitter okay yeah sarl post on Twitter but someone did they send it here or yeah it's on my desk and then also if you look over over there there's a knitted or crocheted bread sorus that someone made recently too and so I brought it to sort of solidify you know we kind of have a purpose to make bread sorus plushies now too Nick keeps telling me no but I'm going to keep pushing because I think it's it's necessary see even Elijah knows yeah but you heard Elijah's ideas for Merch
management earlier look at how cute it is okay it's fairly cute fairly it's fairly cute oh my God this doesn't make any sense though what does this have to do with technology this has nothing to do with us it's a merch company it doesn't have to be  bread all right let's get this computer built jeez all righty so you guys can focus on the computer we'll bring back our hoodie knock to a hoodie XL this is the second of the third xl's and we still have larges and mediums later but auction is
going to be live for the XL nocta hoodie all   hydration some people with misophonia just got really unhappy I'm sorry but I actually do need some moisture on my tongue I'm very very sorry I'm sorry for my my body you can just mute uh I oh I can I do have a mute button okay yes I can do that um people got mad at me when I drank from my water bottle so oh did they all right well do better Alex what how's float plane chat doing what's up you guys dad will eventually give us bread they want it
and they say they're okay they're doing good they need a bread plushy yeah but you guys will buy anything and there's only so many of you like we can't we can't hit minimum order quantities for just with just the float plane that sounds like a problem why did I even tune into this then we make it so if you buy it off the store you have to order 10 at a time that's how we'll make the minimum requirements like uh like Oreos you don't just buy one Oreo you get like a 100 pack true I like that comparison
pack of tracksuits it could be a cartoon character you just wear the same thing every single day like most of us here cuz all we wear is LTD thank you to our winner of the hoodie $271 by the way on the XL noct to a hoodie all right how are we doing for auction items do we have enough do we have too many how are we oh we're perfectly on Pace really yes yeah cuz they're organized for each build so we just have to get through the couple things here all right by the time that
this build's done let's do the driver then oh the driver it's beautiful all right I mean this isn't an auction but we should also probably cut to our sponsor at some point oh yes they've been you know there's a long stream we should cut to them at some point go go go big thanks for watching today's video is vessie wet socks see the word makes you cringe don't worry Bessie's on the case vessie Footwear claims their diatex technology makes their shoes 100% water and they keep your feet cool in the summer War

don't even know the reference so far ShamWow yeah sh I got the reference before Alex wow yes that may be our first let's go he gets references before me all the time CU it's like Zoomer memes and crap yeah but sham W is definitely not Zoomer people yeah don't say that one day it'll be our turn hey I know you guys we teased it earlier do you think it's finally time I think it's time all right just do it the allmetal LTT screwdriver titanium Edition it has a titanium end cap and a titanium beauty
ring I supp Boy ring and it makes like the most satisfying sound when you close it all right it's anodized titanium we can't say it's one of one there might be more in the future but for now it is one of one yeah this is a prototype but this is uh oh this is one of the good prototypes so the early prototypes of the metal selector ring were a little bit wider than the handle uh because we had some challenges accommodating the original racket mechanism without uh making it bigger in order to get it to
slip over um there we go oh yeah anyway this one the Finish is about as close to factory new as you're likely to get there's a couple sort of tiny dings but realistically this is the kind of product that I expect to develop a very  time uh I believe this is this is anodized titanium right yes anodized titanium uh oh yeah and that's the "sound oh my God we're at over $1,800" "$1,900 for this" screwdriver I'm not promising this is one of a kind guys but for now we've "reached 2,000 doesn't this set the base"
price now for all of them going forward I mean that's one of the reasons this product doesn't exist yet is because even Mass producing it it would be at a price that might not make sense3 retail product one of one maybe um 2300 "wow $2,300 you guys thank you so much" this oh wow this show off that uh show off the tip again can we get a nice closeup of that get a closeup of that  34 2400 look at that and sold for 2351 "$2,351 kle sample thank you very much to" the Creator Warehouse team probably
Sebastian hand assembled this he did um I don't remember where this handle came from there's a variety of different sort of configurations of metal driver we're working on it might have come off our torok I'm not sure I doubt it this one looks too clean that is true yeah I don't think this is a tmok one I think this is a supply fire that we're evaluating but that sale is pending so we'll let it go and then if we need to re auction it near the end all right we   what it's always fun kind of hearing
that the reactions as people kind of  like uh who was it today who told me I think it was Adam do you know what those graphical elements in your OS like the circles and beach balls and stuff like that are called un yeah they're called what are they called they're called throbs throbbers throbbers throbbers yeah so so you'll make a joke and then Elijah goes all throbber on you and uh what Ao no no that's not AO oh oh you're talking about the windows animations I see auction black and gold water bottle 64
hours so I changed the subject we're  bottle can I go home yet you're never going to see your  God what is going on with this GPU Mount okay Asus I'm really liking the designs of these cases super cool but you guys got a serious case of doing things differently going on here this is super easy I don't even know what you're talking about well I haven't looked at it from the back yet okay but it just has it just has a thing here yeah look at that yeah but why why it was a thumb screw it this was so much
easier than the normal way of doing oh my God why this three and not the rest like I okay it doesn't matter the point is these oh two or three just two two of these come out not three like last time there we go this goes in oh my goodness this is ridiculous I can't even uh yes you can I can no no I can I can even I like literally can't no I can't even I literally can't even 271 from hacker thank you very much heck yeah man we should find some more water bottles if I'd known every one of
our water bottles is going to go for like 250 bucks we could have done more of them we're bamb everyone we're changing all the prices after this oh you you went outside yeah I see it um hey speaking of $250 why don't we uh why don't we auction something that's  gotton I was trying to release the clip and I forgot about the want to do a backpack yeah let's do a backpack yeah yeah that that was what I meant oh  it okay and is this going to go in uh sure LTG store backpack $250 we have I

fantastic is this uh is this the latest sticker pack that we have on the if you wanted to do this to your computer too you can pick up these sticker packs at lt.com oh boy that would cost a fortune for enough to do an entire case I don't think anyone's going to do that it looks dope though it's actually shocking how much we spend on stickers have you ever seen the orders for these oh yeah of course but we obviously pick like the best stickers so of course they're going to be expensive but they're so pretty
like this one is hollow you see that yeah I know they're beautiful yeah no we've got I I've seen literal six fig POS go out for stickers Y which is um anyway uh it's something it's a good thing we give most  free y okay that laptop is going live now that we were just talking about that  okay the uh the Neo series by them is actually really cool cuz they basically took what was good about like their Helios line and then we're like What if we do the same thing but cheaper and I
don't remember all of the changes but none of them are meaning in any way pretty much like for Zone RGB instead of individual every single key do you care I really do not all right what are the odds this is going to fire up first try is this the drive from this system yes this is empty okay good so this goes here it's 100% odds cuz you built it what it's going to work you said what are the odds oh sorry I was just answering your question thank you um  leave all [Applause] right we have three more systems to
build still please tell me the other  4:30 uh we we were smart and we have installed the AO in the next one okay that's really smart because that is going to make it go a lot faster aio's officially banned for our next charity stream no we just do them beforehand it's ban Oh that's oh I'm really sorry to hear that might have one planned so I'm sorry this is really cool check this  proof oh yeah I need these right here this sorry what about these they are all what is it Matt 20 gigs per second yeah
all 20 gigs per second on the front oh except the USB 2.0 On's I assume yes yeah so the type C and the two uh type A's but you want the twos because I don't know about you but my DAC only likes two and also my steering wheel only likes two so if you have older stuff i' also run into situations where like a bios update wants a USB 2.0 port or like a USB 2.0 drive that is so cool I can't believe this locking power connect or power button I'm so happy right now also has wheels here we go it
has wheels yeah if you tilt it up you can slide it around easy on the back wow oh yeah it does it has wheels on the  $600 sorry Alex am I making this more difficult to plug in uh no I've got it is this bothering you no I'm done now hold on a gosh darn second uh some of our fans aren't spinning did we ever actually power that Fan Hub that's a good question um well I didn't I also didn't cool so that means probably not we didn't oh there it is it was it was just like hidden okay oh dear oh boy getting SATA
in there is going to be tough no no no don't worry I have small hands power small hands power  hands all right I got this oh Lord also that Ram is beautiful Alex yeah no I said it was going to be a problem like I was not joking yeah wait you put the why' you put the drive cage back in cuz it's a completed computer oh dang it Alex they don't even have any hard drives so but now they can add them oh good news the computer posted right but it has no cooling fans Alex well then hurry up Tech boy yeah
that I thought that you said you had small hand Powers I do there's a limit okay I mean if I was one of those superheroes who has no limits it'd be no fun to watch movies about me like Superman what and Captain Marvel you know like when you're too powerful it's not it's not fun anymore there's no there's no tension and that one show that's by the people that made Dairy  good I do not I don't know I thought Andrew was going to help me out he's Irish you're I do not know what Dairy
girls is but I you watch watched it Dairy girls is fantastic my wife is watching I have never seen Dairy girls and I've never heard of it you need to  girls why are they arbitrarily using number one Phillips screws on this thing who does that okay if I can tilt the power supply I'm hoping I can get this Cable in without completely taking it out you got to make it upset then just got to I know what that means I get your slang  slang um okay I've enabled XMP okay you just turned it off that's really cool
yeah I did cuz I need to plug something into the power supply so get wrecked okay well should we auction something off then while you do that yeah how about our second and final is this our final one I think oh wait wait no we have three never mind have three all right our second Alienware bundle it comes with our Alienware Pro keyword Wireless it's about 75% keyboard our Alienware Mouse as well as an Alienware 728 it's I'm reading upside down 72h headset uh it's valued at about $500 and the auction 
meow what was it you were talking to like the engineer of this keyboard and it's like super accurate uh a lot of keyboards have around a 10 G variance in actuation force and this is under five for the whole keyboard so it's 40 G to press each key plus or minus 5 which is really good um can I get a light most certainly I didn't think  um thank you you're  okay okay dang it oh it was really close I'm  this sorry Andrew riveting content the back of  looks like that sold to cryster for 871
it says it's pending though so we'll wait for that to go through but thank you very much 871 ow did it click it didn't click why didn't you click click damn you uh okay no I think uh hold on where's my screwdriver at oh my okay  man oh my  go how's that not how's that not clicked it's all the way in there's no cap then it's clicked there's no no it's not clicked though oh that sounded like a click um I thought I heard one yeah it wasn't oh okay sorry s p no yeah it's not uh it's not
in but it's in it's in but not in it's in a shing your stupid connector here I am going to hurt my hand if I this can I nope okay you're good ow at least he wasn't lying he did hurt his hand yep okay we can plug it in after no no we just need to have a little conversation with it you need to click just like Adam Sandler just click he guys see that I'm I was going to say say I assume it's a movie but thanks for stay stealing that from me we got to get faster we getch you you going I can't go  fast
can't okay um if you want to maybe yeah I feel like I'm blocking you no no that's that's perfect that's good okay there we go okay great what the heck how is it not clicking in I'm putting so  it can we just assume it's in sorry can we assume it's in no no it's it's it's definitely in but it's definitely not clicked uh okay it's labeled satap we're going deeper that's the solution it's forbidden lonus no we're going deeper we're going to the next over connector I just assume there's a bit of a tolerance
issue there okay it clicked okay yes okay well no no we're not out of the woods yet cuz I had to unplug two other connectors in order to get at that one oh by this point it may have been  off but where would the fun where would the fun have been there don't worry this will be faster and then it's not faster okay do I ever say it's going to be faster yes hm do I need to remind you of the water cooling shoot two weeks ago which one was that where you uh sna a screw off left half of it in there and
then proceeded to try to drill another screw into it and then that one snapped off that was pretty funny oh Elijah your mik died no oh that's why Dan stole it from me I  guys my personal projects are fine sure how long did it take you to get that pool done that's not I I didn't build the pool it was your you invested in it as a tax write off and sorry s sorry okay I'm going to walk away the pool is not a tax right off you know the danger Elijah when you joke about stuff like that is there are people in the
audience that are innocent enough to believe it and then we end up with these rers oh man it's called engagement bait I've taught you well which again is a joke I didn't teach him that Adam says that every time we write scripts now he's like should I leave this in I feel like it's engagement bait and we're like I don't know you should probably you  funny okay I got it they're done all right go tiny hands power the only side effect is that your knuckles end up red after so you can you can tell which
ones were in the computer yeah it's a PC build but with all the fun of working on  cars is this ready to power on uh nope I mean you can try it if you want we need to screw in I suspect are those the right thread he was right no where did these come from where theil did these screws come from well I think those came out of the power supply but I think that they were wrong oh and I think that was my fault oh neat but I noticed it now so uh so that's good yeah I'll take those here
I'll give you these and I'll take those there you go thank you kindly while they figure that out did you know that we tuned the magnet for this screwdriver so that you would pick up exactly four screws out of a bag if you just dipped it in okay hold on did you know that yeah right no no watch okay no never mind it's just really strong I was like yeah right I was just  strength see the problem when you say  lonus com full circle yeah but that's like that's the fun it's just that when when you've been
doing it for 12 years if just 1% of people believe you every time you're  enough next thing you know someone's cooling their PC with  guys water bottle time 64 o the red and white Edition we'll be auctioning this one off we're going to be starting the  right called home oh the home edition Oh Canada I yeah H oh I you Jose I was about to startch sleep I'm sorry oh I'm sorry sir it's not even the right lyrics for the star mangled  see the thing is I can't tell with you I'm not sure if you think it's that he's

lock it the total retail value 43527 3 and the auction is going live already oh it's already live oh well we're up to 2500 we're up to 2600 2700 "3,2 400 500 come on do the voice do the" do the voice can I see 390 390 thank you "4,000 4,000 we got 4 minutes 40 seconds" "4,000 wow I can't even keep up" "4,400 4,400 what sorry you're eating" more wel I have a Welches no I'm good thank you for "4,400 lus will eat Welches there you"   sty 4550 come on yeah there you go we're
nearly at MSRP I could even see it with the light I was like holy cow so much practice why isn't it booting uh because we haven't pressed F1 to run set up and turned off the CPU F speed monitoring oh do we not have the plug in the right header who plugged in the header uh that was me well you got it in the right yeah I thought it was in the right one one right one right one wrong one wrong one ow yeah you hit the op head do you have the helmet on your hand no we're good
okay 4600 who said you need Welches the rest of mine okay all right fantastic so do we have a boot drive in this one or are we not bothering to game on this one uh you should have put it in that boot dri's in there oh yeah that's right we did put that in okay sick uh how are we doing for bids on this boy we're up to 4700 3 minutes 10 seconds remaining "$4,700 3 minutes remaining that's" exciting where' my float plane check do you think we can break way over there I think or it's over there oh there
someone else has float plane chat open on a different computer well that's fantastic how you guys doing how much is shipping I don't know do we just did we just ship it uh it's for something like this probably substantial but we're going to ship it harder than a Twilight character it'll go through what USPS or Canada Post one of the two uh yeah one of the two I think I don't yeah I don't know how the I I don't know how the fees work though I'm sure we'll figure it out but
yeah it'll probably be expensive it's not our problem so all right it's whatnot that deals with that my PC but they're waving all those fees correct we we already did we already did the weight so it calculates it based on where I don't have a mic it's based on you had a mic I lost it to sah you lost your mic all the products already had a weight that we we put into the system so when you sign up you should have put your location and it should try and give you a good idea of like what the price
will be for shipping if there's any like issues we can change it after the fact but should be pretty accurate I would hope so we'll see sick um we got just over two minutes to go all right she's booted up well 4750 it might have been appropriate for us to have some more creation focused stuff on here but we don't so we're going to play a game uh well that's realistically what you're doing anyway with portal with RTX I have not played this yet I haven't either I haven't even tried it it is
portal with RTX wow they took out some funny features though they took out the little radios on each level what well yeah but how would how would someone like you know what a radio was anyway I  tutorial still don't know what one is but I knew I had to find them why' they take out the radios did they explain that I have no idea oh interesting the radios are like one of the best parts of the game it's like a real what makes portal portal kind of thing I don't remember remember I last
played portal when it came out so like there there was one like right here there's a radio a minute left less than a minute what's it at we're at "4,750 do you think we could see 48 maybe" "I think we could see someone break 5,000" "I think it should break 5,000 come on" for BC Children's Hospital take up the children oh everything is locked all the challenges are locked all the other levels are locked I guess we're starting a new game tutorial though portal with RTX new game here we go a tutorial about
"the radios what this 48 yeah hey 4,800" "4,800 bucks" going that looks 25 seconds oh there's radio right there what are you talking about no like the ones hidden around the the the maps like each level like there was one like under a staircase or something that 15 seconds do you think we can see  seconds space jump yep I got it five four 3 2 1 we're sold make sure the transaction goes through I'm am going to sit on the toilet pending all right it's pending it's it's quite a quite a high trans but
"it is a high transaction at $4,800 so" thank you very much that's going to be quite the assistant it's making me wait 20 seconds to leave this room 14 13 did you imagine if our YouTube video started and we had 20 minutes of or 20 seconds of nothing yeah have you're not watched our videos hey whoa whoa whoa whoo that's an introduction that's a setup no your appetizers are great I'm sorry okay all right so I went through a portal I mean I guess it looks pretty different it's one of those things where
Nostalgia glasses I think are sometimes stronger than new technology like I'm sure if I fired up portal not with RTX in the last 10 years I'd be like oh yeah this doesn't look very good but um it still looks perfectly fine if I'm honest yeah I mean well this I mean this is something one of the biggest strengths is when those little like glowing balls go through the level seeing that R tracing it's it's very nice very cool okay and this too can be yours for what "was it $48 $4,800 we're waiting for the"
transaction to go through but here you go massive thank you to all of the contributors who sent Hardware over for this one now it's time for us to continue before we do that before we do that craw our way forward through this marathon of Charity Auction streaming no we need to go back line oh we're going back we're going back back we need Sarah about to go back to her job oh right oh cool this is her job yeah right yeah I think so I mean anything you get paid for you do profal s I got the I stick
bom yeah don't put that on like your travel documentation definitely not yeah I'm a professional sticker sorry what's that second word uh okay oh what do we have oh Main your mg1 pre-built oh there's a computer in it yeah okay well well I mean do we really need to see the computer when we've got this to look at uh it's a one of one main gear mg1 do you want do you want to read it out for the people sure okay one of one main gear you miss this bring Sarah to stream oh okay that's like the the whole purpose
of bring Sarah to stream this is a one of one main gear mg1 with two custom front panel designs featuring The One one and only bread sorus I'll be your Vanna they're absolutely beautiful that union grievance all right all right made by the one and only me Sarah but the rest of the PC is to be sticker bombed which has been completed to the best of my ability I'd say if you get paid for it you're a professional uh professionally sticker bomb so let me just put this back down
for you real quick do you want to sign it maybe that would add add I I have signed it already and add a little dinos sure I'd be happy to uh using LTT store LTT store.com sticker packs uh and is to promote the upcoming bread sorus Dino vinyl I don't know if we're allowed to leak that yet but here know about this yes you do you approved it what's a dino vinyl like the little the little vinyl toy oh that thing we're doing that yeah obviously okay more bread the better okay it's beautiful do we have one to
show anyone no I didn't Brak well we can use the little crochet dinosaur instead start the auction for this okay the auction has started tell them the spe tell them the specs yeah we need the specs okay Nvidia GeForce RTX 460 TI 8 GB uh Intel Core i5 [Laughter]  uh sorry 34 thank you Cooler Master hyper 212 Black Edition CPU air cooler uh Microsoft Windows 11 home that's great there was 16 gigs of ram in between there but it had a lot of jargon in it don't worry I'm here to help thank
you thank you uh I do art not computers thanks y um if you got a Mac she's all over it you know no problem I think you're giving me too much credit yeah that's I was trying uh uh 512 gigabyte solid GM is that how you pronounce that it's a brand um it's solid oh solid don't worry about it okay SSD P4 yeah yeah yeah sure PCI I E4 nbm SSS SS uh MSI Pro b660 m a cc WiFi DDR oh boy it's a motherboard you told me to read this okay you're doing really well uh MSI 6 50 W MPG you can just stop
there 650 W this is I know this is the PSU though yes see yes plus plus you get the usual best-in-class in-house customer support when you bid on the system that's right just because it's being opt auctioned off doesn't mean you lose out on any support if something maybe goes wrong in shipping all right so there you go guys main gear system custom bread sorus front panels there you go a little something like that and uh if any of that kind of got lost in the mix uh it's
got a core i5 13400 F it's got 16 gigs of RAM a 512 gig SSD and an RTX 460 and it's sticker bombed and it's stick most importantly it is sticker bombed and signed by Sarah and I also signed it but like I didn't design it so her signature is sort of more important for this one all right we'll see how it does and I think we're going to get our next system going thank you Sarah for being an  okay the AO is pre-installed thank Elijah it it wasn't Elijah why did you why did you take credit I didn't I
just I did thumbs up I was just trying to be supportive well who was it I I think it was Colin but he couldn't tell me if it was that's fair we're not really sure what he does around here but we think it's a lot uh okay it's the all white machine sick everything is like blindingly white uh perfect let's get started on this bad boy do we have the summary I am stuck to this there we go do we have the summary sheet for this one uh uh oh good uh it's another back to front build I like curve balls on live
streams they're good it's a good thing we have five of them yeah where's the description oh no so back to front to be clear if I was building a system for myself today I would seriously consider it the aesthetic advantages are fairly obvious having all of your cables go into the back of the system and I think Asus has done a pretty good job of making their parts intergenerationally compatible even if you don't stick with the BTF thing so if you were to say not invest in the motherboard again you could put
your BTF graphics card in a non BTF um motherboard you could take all those connectors in your case and just kind of move them around to the front of your new board and vice versa with the graphics card uh so it's all pretty  kind of blinding depending how you think about it but total value for this "$3,415 wow absolutely sick so we're" going to kick this off with a core I9 14900 K man Intel went all in on these CPUs I mean jeez okay so we got a total of 24 cores on this bad boy 20 seconds
left on the main gear or "2,637 thought I got the core count wrong" and he was correcting me when I heard 27 cores on it Nel sure okay did you did you just say Nel Intel I I I got a lot of DeLay So timeline where a prominent Japanese gaming company took over the CPU industry um all right main gear is sold 2637 "$2,600 for the main gear fantastic thank" you thank you so much do we have a running total where are we at so far um  that doesn't any of the pending stuff we
"are definitely above like 20,000 25,000" if all that pending transactions go through how do we confirm these pending ones is there is that a there is a team working on it right now we're working on that yeah behind the basically person's bank and whatnot need to have a little discussion you know oh dang it I'm stuck again okay I got this all right let's get our Ram going for this uh oh wow they sent over some more Corsair   54 gigs this is a dual 32 gig kit let's go ahead and throw this bar can be
replaced with a heat sink or a 3D printed decoration does corser provide the files for that I think so that is super cool allwhite design for an even subtler RGB effect than the standard black please check that this kit is "6,000 and not 6600 as procurement and" what and PC part picker disagree oh that  note okay well it's "6,000 oh yeah okay so which one was" "right is it 6,000 or 64 it's 6,000 it's" "6,000 6,000 okay well okay sure fine" you're back can go there uh let's go
ahead and this is going to be so much faster and easier now uh oh we need to do our SSD sabrin sent over yet another one of their rocket 4 plus nvme ssds uh it's using TLC nand which is faster and more reliable than qlc but still has massive capacity 4 terab for all your games and media oh yeah there we go man these just like with the double-sided Nan chips like they feel they feel like they have more capacity what is all over my fingers the Asus computer oh really I think it was when you reached in and
like were trying to get stuff I really it's Sharpie prob Sharpie Mark oh I know what it is it's the smelly Felts that I was drawing on my laptop with during our leadership oh yeah you definitely have smudges yeah yeah uh they they had us do an exercise that was supposed to be to  between unconscious competence and conscious incompetence sure it's a whole thing something something when you're learning a new skill something Etc the point is um I had to write my name with my right
hand and then write it with my left hand and I forgot to bring a pen and paper to the uh session so I wrote on my laptop with a scented marker yep that's leadership for you let's go ahead and get this SSD installed it's also auction something I feel like auctioning a thing sure I've got a few features for this board it's white it's back to front has a Gen 5 GPU slot if we ever get any Gen 5 gpus it's Wi-Fi 7 really wow Wi-Fi 7 seems like it's making its way into products really
fast yeah which is a really good thing because Wi-Fi 7 is sick like we have had some Wi-Fi upgrades that are very incremental and then we've got Wi-Fi 7 which is generational it's it's an enormous upgrade uh what I am CED next you're damn it sorry I beat you call did I he said cued oh CED that makes way more sense you need to get your ears checked line us yeah buddy another backpack from LTT store.com 250 USD they're great they're fantastic and we're going to get lus to sign the
inside sure I need a I'm not prepared I don't have a Shar one oh thank  charge yeah it's not like I'm building a computer or anything you no you're not you're supposed to be auctioning things  how what no you want it upside down so when they okay sorry you want it upside down yeah cuz then you know you take your bag off you're like  okay the autions running for this right    w77 $70 thank you very much heck yeah one the side I don't know where my screwdriver  um have you tried checking my uh Tech
sack I might have just grabbed it and put it in there I don't know wow. two slots love to see it all right let's go ahead and Chuck our boot Drive in here um and before you guys call me on this that's on purpose I don't want to use up the thermal pad on a drive that is not going to be staying in there that's just one of our utility drives crucial sends those over so that we just kind of have good quality drives kicking around all right let's go ahead and throw that on there perfect uh oh where did my where
did my laptop go why don't I hang out with the float plane peeps for a little bit unless uh chewy if you have some merch messages we'd be happy to check those out sure hi lonus I just want to say I love watching your DIY videos with Alex because every time you do something yourself the editors always need to leave a warning say not saying not to do it that way I love it keep it up we don't worry we'll never stop doing it the right way is fine but doing it the wrong way is fun and sometimes really really
stressful yeah which is fun for you even if it's not fun for us which is fun for us we love it when things are fun for you apparently we missed something to auction off from the last table oh no way are we doing that an early prototype of the pen apparently according to the note it has a different screw on clip thing than the final version that is the notes wording bolt action pen pull it down comes out and you can just like flicks it back up which is very cool but are
you going to tell the story about why it exists oh yes so in the first round of screwdrivers when we ended up having the shaft made I think it was what how many "100,000 50,000 an insane amount of them" were not up to what we wanted as our spec so instead of just calling it quits melting it all back down or Throwing It All Out we decided to turn them into fail pens take our failure and make a pen so it wasn't our failure but yeah it was our original Shaft suppliers failure
so if you look this is the nerling of the finished driver so it has quite a lot of texture to it this is the nerling of the shafts that that original supplier tried to send to us um and get us to approve and we basically said well that's not good enough for you to get a proper grip on it for driving in a screw but when we got our hands on them we thought but what it is is a an unaggressive enough grip for just holding as a pen so let our loss be your "gain we have 100,000 of these shafts yes"
we have actual pallets of screwdriver shafts it's "comical sorry keep going we have 100,000" of these shafts and we've come up with some innovative ideas for how to use them uh what's kind of fun is I was I was pointing out to one of the engineering buys that um they had a couple of samples that weren't really quite the same and they were like well yeah why do you think we rejected them as screwdriver shs because they're all the same the tolerances are all over the place so every pen might be slightly
unique so this is it the fail pen and this early prototype can be yours for just whatever you pay for it very cool I think the auction actually just ended I saw the green light how much did it go for can't $341 to uh macalan $341 thank you so much for the bolt action pen uh we need a not um ratcheting driver you know what I'll go grab that you're on you're on  it all right here we  screwdrivers oh come on I was able to get into that one with this please don't  is that all of
them it's so novel putting in all of the screws in the PC I know right you never have time for that but these are actually shipping to customers okay we do need the fix sha for that one yep it's not magnetic this is early oh yeah I know uh yeah which really sucks once you go magnetic you just it's not possible to go back and deal with non-magnetic screwdrivers is such a pain in the butt all right man this build I can smell it it's going to be so fast oh yeah until it isn't until yeah
till something goes wrong we've got another one of these ginormous coolers this time in white uh what's the model of this Thing rugen 2 something Rion 3 something like that know it's here somewhere basically it's a triple 120 with h a water block with pre-applied thermal compound a fan for your vrms and a screen for your dankest of memes uh yeah the rugen 3 360 mm and everything I just said it also comes with a oneyear ID to 64 license that's kind of cool where's our back plate at for this bad
boy uh somewhere presumably nope oh probably in the box that I just had nice nice look I didn't say it was going to go perfectly oh here well he's grabbing that I can tell you guys about our power supply we've got the Susa RG Thor P2 gaming and this label is wrong so let's not worry too much about that nope this is an RG stxs 850 wat White Edition comes with a 10-year warranty and the reason that we chose it is because it's white nice fully modular interface 80 plus gold certified has their hybrid
zero DB fan mode thing that I don't know just turn on because why would you want your fan to turn on if it doesn't need to in order to keep your power supply cool has a 140 mm fan and it should be super quiet yeah go for it alijah on to our next auction another Bob Ross mouse pad retailing for about $30 this is a beautiful mountain scene it's 900 mm x 400 and it's 3 mm thick oh look how pretty it is got happy little trees that's a Bob Ross reference I watched Bob Ross only
because he was like cool for like two weeks on Twitch okay bye Ross was on Twitch what did you not know that that was like why he blew up like well I mean he blew up a long time ago but like but like you know he's not alive right no don't do that cuz that's going to make me look like the bad guy anyways several years ago he's he's  yeah oh boy oh boy yeah Elijah even when they were they did so they did basically Bob Ross was all the all the Bob Ross videos went to Twitch and they
just streamed it on repeat for like a couple of weeks this was years years ago they just streamed every Bob R he died those were from like the ' 80s or the '90s at that time already yeah a rest in peace FL yeah yeah I definitely um but his art lives on most bad oh man I'm sad now 1995 he died in he died before I was born jeez $21 who bought it wow I love this Bob guy on Twitch he should uh he should start a YouTube channel the way you've been talking about him today I just I got kind of a feeling that maybe
you didn't know thought was alive he's alive in all of us oh yeah in all seriousness though there's been a whole lot of like between his estate and like his business partners and his family and stuff I I do wonder who's profiting from this thankfully BC Children's today but um actually just torn yeah it's kind of complicated from the last time I went down the rabbit hole any who um yeah so poor Elijah just lost a friend um I thought he was a really good twitch streamer yeah your bits aren't going up 
control oh I'm upset now I'm actually upset what do the kids say uh O Level O  fleek time to hit that gritty y'all Dan St I am actually crying too  I've been trying to learn all the jna alpha and zomer that I can like actually do that I think the cooler is good to go on okay do we have the hardware uh yeah it's right there okay here I'll I'll get here's some um here's some cables that you can actually getting through this really fast we need to keep auctioning stuff okay go go for it auction
something what color wave is this what way is what color pattern is this water bottle okay guess what's guess oh I remember what's the color yeah we ripped off um Apple's midnight nonsense so it's like 12 past noon green or something I forget 12:00 a.m. green and it's live 12:00 a.m. green you can auction on it bid on it for the auction for it we we were just Ming on the like nonsense names for colors from everyone Sunrise yellow and just all that kind of stuff um so we were we were all like
haha 12 a.m. green ha and then I don't know if anyone's everever really noticed or acknowledged the joke I used one of those for years and I didn't get that once and yeah well no I always thought it was called camo yeah I yeah I know just the name on this the name on the site the name on the site is is 1200 a.m. green and we were thinking we were  funny wow any who Elijah want to want to let us know how that's doing I'm watching it right now ten Hawk for 250 $6 nice on the 1200
a.m. green water bottle thank you very much you hen Hawk fun fact that's the only way to get an LTT water bottle right now because they're all out of stock on the store LOL Checkmate liberal did I do it right yeah that's how you say it medium noct to a hoodie we're just going to go right into another one we've already auctioned off a couple of these we still have I think one more XL and a couple larges later this is the medium size the auction is going to go live right now there you go watch it all
all right fantastic man this build looks awesome yeah even without the back to front this would look super clean where is the CPU fan uh you mean the header it's on the front it's on the front yep oh where um oh I see oh well am I not the one plugging into it anyway I think I'm the one plugging into it or do you want the fans Not the pump I person prefer to go pump yeah go pump okay okay I thought that these were the fans actually so the main function of the GPU fan header is
that it's the one that if you configure it in your bios will safely shut down the system in the event that it detects zero RPM uh or not in your bios rather in your um in your motherboard manufacturer software so while we could plug our radiator fans into it that's a lot less likely to cause a catastrophic failure than if our pump were to fail and the fluid wasn't moving because you can actually get fluid boiling in the the block which is bad because pressure and it could cause a leak whereas if you
don't have your fans running you've at least got a lot longer to figure it out and react to it so I strongly prefer to plug in my my AO pump rather than my your pump dies your CPU is at 100° now if your fans die maybe after half an hour it starts getting too hot maybe it's actually just fine yeah and if you're G that'll happen a lot faster but if it's just you know while you're idling and not paying attention um it's you've got more time so it's less of a problem yeah thank you to uh Von balding
for buying the noct hoodie medium at $181 nice thank you very kindly we actually have our next item our first phone of the night ooh wait we've done two pixels already oh yeah our third phone of the night except those were part of bundles this is its own item this is the red magic 8s Pro it retails for about6 $650 16 GB of RAM 512 GB of storage it's got the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor "it's got 6,000 milliamp battery it's" pretty sick I like the design of it camera's right in the middle there for
you is this like a gaming phone is that how these phones yes I think it has a fan in the back and a vapor chamber what that's sick oh that fancy red button the auction's going to go live pretty right now all right I've got a USB header for you Alex if I could just pass that through you I think I can just grab it wow good job I use small hands power nice oh man this third build going so much faster we should have done it like this in the first place that uh I know you guys going too fast now you
know what you live and you learn and we we lived and then we died a little and now we've learned from that uh do we have a a fan Pub or anything like that in this one that we should maybe we should definitely just throw in SATA power while we're it sure I will throw a sta power courtesy connector in there I don't see any but yeah we just want that I always do that no problem no problem we didn't do that for the first build but gosh darn it we're we're learning as we go here no we did for the
first one we threw s of power on the very first one oh okay I didn't I did nice good work all right here we go J had a has won the auction at $841 for red magic 8s Pro all right  uh what am I looking at here it's upside down there we go there's your problem CP BG pcie let's go with these two there we go power well I'm sorry the thing about building these back to front builds is we can either give you the you know nice looking side to look at or we can give you the side where absolutely anything is actually
happening uh they don't want to see that yeah I don't think they need to see that it's pretty cool the way they handle the power pass through for these BTF uh graphics cards though so they've got this custom connector here and then they've just got a wack ton of pcie power connectors at the back that H can pass through either there we go with 12vt high power here you go so you do one of those or you can just put a wack of eight pin power connectors on here  sick yeah this is one of those trendy
trends that I I don't know I'm kind of coming around to is this a back to front card uh yes it is it says BTF yeah it's got a thing sweet I seriously cannot believe how much of their lineup they're making BTF ready but like the front of this build Immaculate the back right now yeah don't worry about it yeah just look at that side yeah exactly that's that's what I'm saying okay so I just need that guy cool how do these clips work they're just cable managing so we might as well sell
a LTT store.com backpack $250 the auction is going to be starting right  yeah uh we'll try that's us the try guys is that copyrighted uh didn't they get canceled or something I mean one one of them did yeah one of them did wasn't it just like cheating though uh wow the way you say that well but like you know that's like the sort of thing that gets your marriage cancelled yeah but he was like the family  lady do you think it's fine if we don't have a 12 pin and just have three sixes
yeah eight yeah I mean what difference does it make yeah why does the 12 pin exist at all other than to create controversy um yeah sometimes your computer just doesn't catch on fire and you're a little bit sad about that you know what they say there's no such thing as bad publicity although okay Jay Hado $530 for the backpack thank you very much l you got  thanks buddy there you go no thank you I'm doing my best I was I just looked at the spreadsheet by the way apparently my
helmet is up for auction really yeah I don't what am I going to do does that mean I have to go home no we can get you another one okay okay do you want to do that one now sure all right I guess we're auctioning my helmet we'll get lonus to sign it we'll get everyone who's on crew today to sign it the pink helmet it's going up for auction it's purple it's what that's definitely purple I can't see it oh let me look at the it's colored I don't think you're allowed to say that word I that's not what I meant

system yet in spite of not having as much shroudy business wow well shroud's  well maybe if we'd ever given him an invite he would show up you ever think of that can we invite him I want to meet him really bad shroud hey uh big fan realistically we'd probably have to go to him we're not that's fine I'll go we're not that important can you fly me out um XL hoodie by nocta we're going to be auctioning one of these bad boys off this is I think our last XL hoodie yep auction's going to go live right now 
this is the last nocta XL we have a couple more nocas after this but we'll get to them eventually talk to everybody  creators I just I want to be his friend um okay that's parasocial and creepy don't do that whoa whoa whoa I'm the leader of the parasocial gang oh the name changed oh yeah sorry the parasocial social club oh I think blood wig already has that okay well this is officially gone off the rails after just 3 hours live let's get this GPU in here only been 3 hours hours okay four hours who who's
counting um can we get the mother or mother mother mother M monitor can we get the monitor keyboard and mouse over here and let's get this system Going's going to grab that for us Mother Teresa that's what I was going for who by the way Elijah is also ceased who he's not up on current events he just found out that Bob Ross um is not a  streamer you can't put it like that he was live for like 3 months not   pop we all do hey auction ended who was it it was May oh my goodness I'm going
to butcher that name May thank you very  hoodie oh boy let's get these peels done look at this GPU this thing looks sick and so well balanced look you can just flip it around like that wow that's not terrifying at all wow no no one on procurement or anyone involved with this is stressed all when you do that no no no that I got this i got this the problem is when I'm in a hurry or inattentive I'm paying perfect attention to this there's no way that I could drop it here watch I'll do it three more
times oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah see no problem I bet I can even go by the ends see no do you think I could do two what do you think he's ignoring me I he I will not look I want to go home this evening so we need to build some computers don't worry we got this cuz if we break that GPU we have to go buy another one on L do you think you could do it onehanded yeah I could do it one  no damn it yeah Dan doesn't want to go home well he lives here I thought he lived at the don't tell people that oh
sorry sorry I didn't know that was a secret I thought it was just well known all right here we go I have to pay taxes there's your problem right there you living here is a tax write off tax write off tax write off employee but what the what the D why is everything different about this what is what am I even looking at what what is this PCI retention   bite oh well there's your problem right there power connectors not  Wow and then you just wow can I get those on every motherboard please forever oh and I
jammed it okay never mind totally Bob maryed it right there who by the way is also not alive I don't even know who he is is so we're John no no l no all right  it by the way we have a link in the description you can go directly donate to the BC Children's Hospital we're at "about $1,800 I think right now Chase yep" that's awesome that's fantastic oh we should do another little plug for them we haven't in a while sure yeah oh I've been writing on the back I need that one back where's number 
oh I'm doing it yeah oh just a reminder that today we're raising money for the BC Children's Hospital digital lab previously we talked about their work integrating VR and 3D printing into patient care but they've also done a lot on the software side as well um but the goal that information doesn't have to be a PDF like seriously though right yeah PDFs suck they have created Interactive  diabetes.com excuse me um they've created my carepath doca to assist with chronic pain management and
he hub. apppp for children that have cardiac issues uh here oh okay at heart Hub you can see things like a 3D model of a heart with an atrial sepal defect that is much more tangible than an informational pamphlet look at this look at this cool well I show the people maybe one sec one sec one sec he's he's going to show you in a minute I'm going to get this plugged in it's it's  oh look at this that's a hurt it's it's got a something defect I don't actually know what the problem is
but it's really cool that you can look at it look at that thanks Alex yeah very cool so they're doing really great work we've got a donation link and all the proceeds from the charity auction today are going to BC Children's Hospital I think we are ready to fire up another system man these things just get better we need to auction more stuff we didn't auction enough stuff I know I was trying we need to fire up system no we need to auction no we need to fire up this system okay overridden knock to a
bundle Chase get this ready uh nhd15 with three fans as well it's going it literally says like I said earlier the goat of CPU coolers auction Starts Now seriously though check this out is that clean or is that clean D is it okay that is so clean I don't know guess we'll find out I wasn't sure if you had plugged in everything in the back so I just assumed you had memory training probably seems fine yeah seems Seems like it's doing good it's rebooting sick I believe Alex I
believe I don't know if we ever powered on this monitor though is the monitor powered on uh where is it plugged in I mean I don't know maybe yes yeah it's plug give it a sec though I think it was doing memory training I think it's fine I don't know where the light is though hello light hey Travis thank you very much for buying the noctua $454 raised for BC Children's Hospital heck yeah fantastic yeah thank you all right HDMI no signal there we go it's on hey nice F1 to run

came from Y and it's live and it's live and it's live so go for it we thought that would be the helmet but then it sold yeah we really we really did think a lot of things were going to kind of um like a lot of the LTT store stuff was going to be a lot more affordable like we kicked in a whole bunch of LTT store stuff but like we have way more still water bottles have been going for $200 so well it's because you had to start signing them what Oh Me Oh we can sign this I
haven't signed one yet yeah oh you want to sign sign a message apparently someone on Twitter said that uh we have not connected the AR argb cable on the white BTF build a argb cable I don't know if we're missing a cable or not but maybe it got fixed already wanted to give you a heads up the auction has ended for the 1X player 1s $720 $720 thank you very much um this is cool I haven't seen this yet so we coming from the front probably what did you do uh uh also I did just get confirmation that

stting RAB boy he was before he got hired we probably wouldn't have interviewed him yeah sorry lonus I'm really did you know in my first week of employment you know those rocks that were in Luke's PC yeah I took like six they're still on my desk I didn't take them home you know that's weird right they're cool he doesn't I think it's weird now looking at it now I'm like man I shouldn't have done that yeah they're on my desk though I never took them home yeah but it's just like what you want to  day
heyo hey you got one hey it looks like the water bottle sold to Surfer Dude 89 for $280 all right heck yeah see I'm selling lonus all right thanks Elijah good work okay so I guess do we want to auction this one off or if we have to redo it do we want to try some of the other ones first why don't we redo the other ones first or actually well no we can do a first attempt at this one yeah let's do this one yeah sure okay so the value the total value for this one was do we have our spec sheet uh it's on
my computer wherever that is oh okay we don't have the one that was uh printed out for it was "$3,415 all right so summary oh all right" we're going we're on that we're on that cam all right ouch dang it summary for this build is we've got a 14900 K 470 TI we've got 64 gigs of ddr5 6000 memory and 850 W power supply it's all back to front and super clean we've got a triple 120 mm AIO cooler and of course it's rgbd up the butt so we're going to have that live in right now right now Chase
has got it listed this is a five minute auction so lots of time to get your bids in verify your account get your bids in   nice uh sorry yes all right cool did we uh did we fire up frame View uh we did not oh I think you just oh no I managed to survive uh they definitely have    game all right and yep it runs Doom maternal like pretty much any modern PC would it's pretty fast oh uh yep I went too fast and I ran into a tentacle that's my bad though that's my bad  fault sick all right why don't we get on to
our next one do we have another computer to build oh do we ever do we ever two more this one might be my personal favorite really oh what makes it your personal oh it's our first all AMD build it's also our only all AMD build and it's got the Starfield GPU uh hold on my notes Here say easily the prettiest GPU in the that's a bad word what did I write oh I did write that I'm sorry yeah I had to censor that oh in the something World Elijah is very mad that we're not auctioning it as a standalone what you
can't bid on stuff you work here what do you mean I I can if I if you're telling "me if I put $15,000 down you would say" no I'm not going to I would say that I have strong doubts about your fiscal responsibility is what I would say but look how pretty this is all right we're going to open it up here we go so this is our white out build AMD it comes with special Starfield Edition packaging for the 7800 X 3D processor this is the AMD side of the fastest gaming CPU and this GPU is pretty special did
AMD send this over specifically for this or do we still have this from that was the last press kit this is the last press kit all right how many did they make again of this 500 total all for random giveaways and contest yeah the last one they had open there's 500 here it is y thank you to it is so pretty it kind of doesn't matter how good the game is at this point when the GPU looks that cool really does look pretty incredible so this is a 7900 XTX if I recall correctly
correct reasonable size for a GPU yep oh beautiful all right let's get this machine built let's give it a let's give it a good home to sit in a home that is unfortunately I'm so sorry not Elijah's house we're going to just put that aside for now all right we'll start with our motherboard and CPU this is not a back to front build I really wish I had a knife today um that's another thing we're out of stock on on the store right now we don't have a single jurry rig everything
knife ah I don't I mean I got the box open already that's okay all right so we've got a strix x670 a gaming WiFi traditional board but obviously with strong vrms beautiful design is this wi-fi 7 as well no this one's Wi-Fi 6E so clearly hasn't been refreshed in the last couple of months but still a very oh hold on a second still a very feature Rich board tons of IO back here how much USB 3 10 gbit per second is that and good gravy like six of them let's go ahead and get this popped in 
kifa all right uh Elijah do you want to get a yeah I was just looking for something medium we're stilling the other what are we still auctioning the computer the white build it's still going it's got 25 seconds left w187 M oh very cool all right thank you very kindly I'm un muted now all right AMD sample not for resale unless it's auction for charity I made up that part of the rule but realistically what are they going to do get mad at me for supporting a children's hospital that would be crazy
all right let's go ahead and get this  here man even the packaging on the CPU is kind of sick you made fun of Jake for getting rid of boxes that's one you'd keep yeah no I would keep I would keep this box I would keep that box for sure all right the CP itself pretty  go oh look it's Andy Andy you're back sorry I just noticed I've been so focused today quick announcement uh the Asus tough gaming white out build has "gone to acceptable refuse for $5,000" and8 uh oh sorry $587 sweet not pending either that one
went through hey we have our first actual confirmed sale on a system all right should we eat one of the other big boys in one where did the Asus back to front go oh the Asus back to front I think that one got oh I see it I see it here give me one second to just get that one back into the auction system y Oh Holy balls this is heavy is that the first one oh yeah yeah do you need a hand nope okay you want a don't hurt yourself I'm not going to hurt myself all right I'm going to just
lift it a couple times then my arms will look bigger and everyone will be happy yeah that's how that works it is yeah um for our SSD we've gone with the Corsair mp700 Pro 2 tbte it's in here for sure yeah there you go that's a wow that's a lot of um it's a big box for a small SSD but get the SSD hey it's got a big performance for a small SSD this is is our first gen five Drive of the day uh seriously okay I mean not that it really matters but it'll do over 12 gabes a second of sequential
reads and over almost 12 gabes a second of sequential rights if you're into that sort of thing sure uh good hey that's my screwdriver oh whoops that explains why the bits are not organized in a fashion I left it in 105 for a little bit and my bits got stolen yeah that seems like the kind of thing that would happen all right let's get this drive installed um with a fast GPU it should keep the GPU well fed for future direct storage games uh yeah I we can definitely say that with confidence this
is not going to be a bottleneck at some point in the near future we can redo this one whenever all right this guy I don't even remember what we put in it I'm grabbing this 14900 KS I believe it was 48 gigs of5 something or other 8200 yeah 48 gig of 8200 Ram it's a 49d it had a 1200 wat power supply in it um I think that's all the key stuff y yeah z uh Rog Maximus ma Maximus ask me to remember a friend's birthday I cannot say I don't know yeah it's your wife that worries about that stuff so
yeah exactly or Vance it's too bad that she no longer bakes us stuff yeah it's not really it became untenable it I don't know once we hit 100 people that's not too bad that's what like one every 3 days that's like a small bakery she used to she used to do baked goods of some sort for everyone's birthdays um it was unreasonable when I started yeah I talked to her about it many times long after it didn't make sense anymore and she was like yeah but I enjoy doing it and I'm like 
reasonable how how's that PC doing oh wow currently at "$5,650 people are taking their second" attempt that can we $ 5750 they should man you only get a second attempt depending on how many times it bounces so between this time so between the straight donations and the sales are we over 25 Grand US now easy I think so that's awesome we're at 23500 confirmed on what not and then on the BC Children's Hospital we are at 1804 again both of those links are in the descriptions on float plane whatever
else you're watching on they'll be down below yeah pretty please just go to their website like if you're not auctioning or doing stuff in the auction just go there and like throw them five bucks 10 bucks or 100 five bucks for all of you right now that'd be insane yeah that would carry it's going to the digital lab there which is very very cool did you know that Jordan's brother works there I did not Jordan's one of our writers here if you're not familiar did you know that
we have 64 gigs of ddr5 6400 for this   installed oh interesting we just hit six grand six grand for this machine 2 minutes 20 remaining I mean it's a pretty sick machine that kind of makes sense oh shoot there's a peel on here what the heck is this power supply what oh it's one of those it's one of those ones those side ones those are actually super cool for some cases do yeah I don't know if they make the most sense for this case I hope you don't want hard drives yeah
that's what J2 s had to do to get it to work okay well that's fine we'll make it work uh basically here if you check check out in here Andy they've got these little mini connectors and they've got the modular interface on the side rather than on the end um for a more traditional case layout it's pretty cool because it means that struggle I had earlier where I got my Knuckles all scratched up never happens cuz if you ever need to plug a cable in you just pop off your back panel
and it's right there instead of having to reach around it um H for this I might  justs oh I see are there any that come with the Box well what power supply is for our last build cuz realistically the power supply is behind the motherboard anyway you're not going to see it doesn't have to be white o I don't know it's they all white build yes so what it's into like wine tasting and antique carpets rugs hey I like wine tasting and I didn't say you don't that's someone who indulges in the
wine uh let's go I don't think I've ever actually had a glass of wine you've never had a glass of wine are you old enough to drink but I am old enough Dan well my voice just cracked so that might have sold my case but hey you know what oh that was beautiful thanks uh did any put the crucial Drive in here the boot Drive uh I had it on the table right here nice oh seriously this is one p oh dang it well I guess I'm going to take out some more screws then yeah honestly this kind of makes sense I mean I I
understood what they were going for before with all the like little tiny pieces of m.2 Shield but realistic like you can just take the whole thing off and then real it's probably going to be a little easier to align anyway man modern motherboards have a lot of m.2 slots good gracious okay  here did it sell did she sell uh the auction finished it's in pending again but it was "$6,050 all right so we'll cross our" fingers that that pending offerer will go through if it doesn't this computer
will go back up for auction again yep but it has gone to Crystal fire Crystal Crystal uh who has purchased other items during the auction so hopefully we're good there very cool all right uhoh uhoh uhoh what what's uhoh they just said uh in in chat they said uh cancel that so we might have to roll it again all right all right we might have to try let do some let's do some other smaller items cuz we got so many items to power through here stuff oh let's do a not small thing actually
what all right Alex wants to do a not small thing we missed this in the last one we were supposed to do it with the last build oh but it's an Asus Rog g16 this thing right here has an Intel Core Ultra 9 185h one a 1 TB SSD 16 GB of RAM an RTX 470 which in a laptop like this is really great and it does have that OLED panel that they have 56 or 50 2560 XGA whatever that is either way 240 HZ OLED it looks absolutely incredible do we need to open it up I don't think we need to
they they can do that you can you can you can open it up okay has a 90 W hour battery it lasts like what 10 12 hours something like that oh yeah not gaming  exactly are we still using this white power supply in this going up now oh yeah um yeah great should well I don't really want to to be honest with you you know what though we could oh no we couldn't uh hm okay so I did look at it and that P the power supply will work just fine in our other case so if we want to just swap
them and not have a white power supply that's probably what we should do I think oh but cables or I can take this to the shop right now angle grind off this and then we can just put the face plate back in and they can never have a hard drive in their computer actually they probably can they can just tape it back there like don't recommend that I like that idea the way hold on how sure are we that these aren't going to fit in here like I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be a Debbie doubter here but
like hold on hold on let me just let me plug this in first so if you want to yeah yeah plug this in first and then if I mash it down flat okay maybe it's just fine I think it's fine but I want to break it the angle grinder no no you don't need the angle grinder I can get it for you we can it in here not necessary let me enable him no do not enable one time we don't angle grind something conveniently there are these little tiny mini connectors instead of the big full-sized
ones so they're pretty low profile I I don't think this is going to be a problem think we got this all right let's get this motherboard installed right after those screws here we go how you doing Elijah I am so happy right now are you we've raised like how "much money this is sick $23,500" dude for the children like Elijah what I'm not in oh I'm a child oh sorry quick update on the BC Children's uh support page uh We've "hit over $2,000 so watch" 2089 oh thank do we have any sort of
incentives uh like if we hit like a no we don't not that we've announced oh anounced all right 5 seconds left 2731 "2,781 do you think we have 2,800 we have" "2,800" 28 laptop oh sick 2850 I'll throw more Welches at lonus I'll do it and sold 2831 very cool and that was for this g16 laptop where's my Welch's sponsorship at  point too B we can't auction Welches today thanks Elijah we can't we can sell one pack yeah we could do anything there's probably like food we probably
shouldn't but I am going to eat some realistically what are people going to do getting mad at us like maybe yeah but that would be stupid I still want the food safe people I don't want to screw around with it's prepackaged it's sealed it's probably illegal in some states you never know yeah you never know actually they can't do anything if we ignore their email we should just go and get a bunch of Kinder Surprises and oh no oh no no no no okay another smaller item now we're going to go for the knock to a
hoodie I think this might be our last large size um we still at least have one more medium so there's still a chance to get an OCTA hoodie they're so comfy uh  now all right yeah we got to Blitz through some auction stuff we have one more large noctua after this one how many items do we have left you guys we have too many items left we haven't even started on this build I'm trying to but the problem is is people keep bidding which is good but then it delays the timer we're going just be sitting here
after we've built all the PCS just selling things do we want to give out a number on how many we have uh how many do we have left yeah how many 37 products but some of those have like a couple uh involved so so we're looking at probably at least 40 more auctionable items wow just start ripping we're trying but we got to wait for the first auction to end I'm probably going to end up having to cut you off then lonus to keep auctions going so that's fine you just do what you got to do I lost my
chat computer uh chewy do you have any merch messages you want to throw at us yeah I got a few let's see with projects like seven Gamers one CPU taking too much of the team's time just to justify today what project of a similar caliber do you wish you could tackle but probably never will ah I mean it's not that we don't have projects that take an incredible amount  yeah we do all kinds of really ambitious stuff these days that I think maybe people just don't realize because it's
not as memorable for them or they are at a less formative stage in their journey into you know computer hardware or technology enthusiasm um trying to think of what would be examples of something that would be I mean oh man even okay even the console tier list video guys watch that video like the production values that David and the editor put into it I mean yeah it not it might not be um you know the the the the effort or whatever that you might expect from a from a you
know fighting with motherboard bios's standpoint um but in terms of the amount of sheer work and and passion that went into it it's it's unbelievable we got a freaking CT scanner yeah that's that's a really cool video that's coming soon I mean even just even just getting that into our warehouse required us to obtain and operate a larger forklift than the one we already have because it was so heavy because of the lead shielding in the panels that we couldn't lift it with our regular forklift um we
do huge projects all the time I think you guys are just kind of used to it now if I'm being yeah the April oh man holy cow the April Fool's video was by far our most expensive project by far it's not even close that we've ever done um yeah I don't I don't I don't know what to tell you other than that if you if you think the old days of spending   um our last hoodie so sold for $271 by the way we're going to sell another one the medium I think this might be our last medium so this might be the last
noctu a hoodie it's not Colin shaking his head there's going to be another no there's going to be two more there's two more what sizes do we have left another medium and then a large okay so I was wrong about the last large as well we have another medium and another large after this Elijah can you stop false advertising it's it's accidental which is then I I'm clear right I don't actually know if that's a valid defense it is not oh why do you know that Dan uh do we have another 18 we must PS oh
here it is oh oh no that's Dan fled wait was that in there to Dan Dan left yeah you called him out he's he had to run away now now we have no producer way to go Elijah what it's not all right you're up I have to produce it now Wan show with Elijah no I'm please gosh no you guys are here till like 2 in the morning playing Super checks now it wasn't 2 in the morning sorry 1:30 in the morning something like that it's okay when we played uh tape to tape we were there till like 1:30 in the morning yeah that
game was lit I haven't important to Hoodie is sold for $221 Last Friday fantastic that's awesome thank you very much $221 we're speedr running some of these auctions now this one might take a little bit of time though we're doing that yeah no yeah I don't want to no because I just want it no same no okay oh my God no apparently we're doing this um this this one comes with a warning this is a zylar clear screwdriver Do not drop it for real Do not drop it it will shatter it is fully
functioning but it was built as a test to determine if zylar will work for our clear screwdriver that we have been hard at work on um it will not it will shatter if you drop it uh these findings are why we currently do not have a clear screwdriver L drops them a lot it is it is otherwise a fully functioning LTT screwdriver just wow clear clearer so you can clearly see and it will actually explode if you drop it yes Do not drop it do not okay do we have an extra one I want to drop one now you can see the you
can see the mechanism while you're using it which is super cool um yeah it's it's it's kind of sick we've been man we've been trying to build this thing forever um wow hopefully we're getting closer but anyway if you want one knowing about the problems with it then that's it that's a prototype apparently we're auctioning it there you go I love the amount of things that lonus just didn't know we were going to auction today I had no idea we were doing this or the metal screwdriver I think what
happened was we had asked creat a warehouse hey what are some things that would be cool to auction that's why you got the bit bit storage or whatever it was that's why we got this all the other prototypes uhhuh man very 5 Seconds "1,160 10 seconds we got 1,200 bidd War" bidding war we got a bidding war we're not going to make these 1 "second 1,160 sold to Just Jared" congratulations congratulations that is went through actually sale went through so it's not pending you're a one lucky dude
"$1,100 for the clear we kids who are" going to be benefiting from your generosity thank you very very much they're going to be in VR the next time they have to do something unpleasant it's awesome well it's not awesome but it's better than it could be yeah all right let's go ahead and get front USB plugged in do we have front USB we're to protect that one when sh so all good oh nice okay yeah keep it with us okay dual eight pins those are there uh what else is uh what else is pending for this
boy are we getting close oh you need to install the CPU Cooler oh balls we need to take the thingy off which thingy off the the chummy oh that's fine that's quick yeah it's not I gotcha I gotcha o all righty next item oh Chase walked away so we can't do the next item but I'll introduce it the Sab Rock 4 plus the 4 tab version we've been putting I think we put two of these in some systems already today 4 tabes of mvme storage flipping fast pcie gen 4x4 if I I I can't open it cuz my fingers are too
chunky but it's pretty cool the auction is hopefully going to go right now can you tell I I'm awkward no I'm   doing that went up I'll be on that yeah okay cool um chewy do you want to hit us  message will the team ever explore quarter-inch ratchets or any small Automotive hand tools um we would love to do something I mean obviously we we love our ratchet design but it's not exactly the size that you would want for an automotive ratchet like it's it's it's pretty bulky
so we would have to completely design a new Ratchet mechanism for that and while we do have the engineering capabilities to do that now it's not a major priority for us we've seen a lot of folks talking about using our uh using our screwdriver for uh Automotive applications even aircraft applications um but we understand that most of our marketing reach is to PC Builders and technicians so if we are going to put realistically the same kind of development time into building a like a
ratcheting driver for you know Automotive uh we'd have to see we'd have to see a return on that investment and I'm just not sure if that's realistic so that's the that's the bad news speaking of return on investment uh nerfy won $556 for the SSD thank you very much all that still all these Pro proceeds going to BC Children's Hospital we have links down below to just donate directly if you can't auction and bid on anything today um but thank you very much nerfy $556 heck yeah all right what else you
got anything else that's like you know precious internal development Hardware uh I'm sure well we do but we have to do other stuff we have so much we have more we dude we have so much let's this not even funny do I look like I'm laughing ha okay you're doing great buddy this right here is the Logitech couples gaming bundle so you get two mice they're both pink but you know if you're comfortable with pink stuff you're probably cool we have this right here what is it um Logitech gpro x60
light speed keyboard front too I know but I need to read the notes here it's a 60% layout as you probably guessed debuted last week damn I didn't know that it has an endless key mapping via ghub it has a good old volume scroll Wait no that's that one no no it has it on the side of it has it on the side okay that's pretty cool and we also have the Pro X tkl light speed that right there is in magenta looks very nice also has the infinite volume knob right there  yeah by the way shout out oops oh we're
just bringing over the the key lights as well shout out Corsair for oh moving away from we have more stuff to packaging oh this also come this also comes with the ltra beam lighting lra beam oh that we looked at some of those during the all log setup sick all right so just lra beam or lra glow as well both oh okay so they've got like a whole lighting setup yes so if you're a streamer or especially if you're two streamers then this is for you yeah anyway total value of this is
"$1,000 uh shout out Corsair for" transitioning to more paper in their packaging this is plastic for some reason but at least there's more paper in the packaging uh we need to get their IQ hubness figured out over over here me help oh dear yeah it is super cool and it like Works super good but goodness gracious wait how is that radiator mounted I have the radiator screws right here it's got screws in it Colin looks very  nervous no I can see their screws in it colum but I'm holding the screws that
came in the Box are you I mean they were in the box that's fine it's fine it's in there on a side note uh repti won the couple's gaming bundle for $520 so that's a pretty good deal uhoh uhoh what did you do those were those were the screws that were in it that's probably fine okay modern radiators don't have the tubes I'm going to check okay oh sorry modern radiators don't have the tubes under the screw holes because people would and put screws that were too long um do you want
to swap that out then I mean they're in there now yeah cool where did those screws come from though I was going to say the box but I remember I did a sarcastic comment earlier and he got mad at me so I held back excuse me you two the uh screws that are in there are from that bag oh there they're from this bag yeah well didn't you pull out a whole bunch of them earlier with the screw driver I can't remember if that was that was a different computer we're on the fourth computer now they all look the same
after this many computers they're different okay okay they did come from this bag everything is okay call is shaking his head okay trying to throw him under the bus he can't even fight back um okay everything is fine there's a whole other set of long screws in here which is pretty unusual but I guess that's just in case you want to do a push pull configuration they include all the hardware you need for that okay so that's good good here's the thumb nuts that I need and let's go ahead and get
these back in the bag o I smell food we're going to do another backpack let's do another back I think we have five more after this one four more four more after this one s this is six uh we're going to get lonus Alex to sign it it's going to go up for auctions retails for 250 us normally so their signatures might bring it up to $100 um but we'll  go what a troll uh Chey hit me all right speaking of Automotive are there any updates on the automotive spin-off Channel I'm curious I'm curious as to
how channels that aren't technically under the tech umbrella would work with  workflow so Alex and I had a fairly long meeting about this uh not that long ago I guess it was a few months ago yeah was like months ago no there's no way it was 6 months ago does time fly that fast it was 6 months ago dude I'm getting old um all right well anyway Alex and I had a long conversation about that as you probably realize there is a good number of Automotive enthusiasts here Alex Andy
Jake Gary spring to mind I'm sure I'm missing out on others I know shad's at least into his car I don't know cars in general uh sorry Andrew Maria yeah basically we've got a lot of Gearheads here the challenge is that as Alex and I discussed one of the one of the coolest things we think we could do that would be a lot of fun would be projects um and the easiest way to get your hands on cars for projects is to use ones you already have because as we build up the channel to you know
Financial viability um we we're not going to be able to just buy vehicles that it doesn't it doesn't really make any sense so the problem with using cars we already have for projects is that doing that in a way that promotes fairness is quite challenging and we've had issues in the past I won't name any names but we've had issues in the past with people getting uh what's the word salty as heck when someone gets something and they don't also get the same thing and the reality of it is if if we do a video on
I don't know um hacking Elijah's Tesla to unlock features he didn't pay for oh please I hate that and then all of a sudden we have to we have to do that on what I don't know every Tesla that anyone here like so it's um it's a weird balance basically it's political um and I hate that it's like that but I have discussed this at length with Alex and he understands why it is is probably not in the cards for now however we are kind of doing some experiments uh so for example plof is on vacation right now and you
guys probably saw the video where we upgraded his car with uh an Android auto deck and we put in a rearview camera um I think that mostly everyone felt sorry enough for plof and the car that he was driving that they didn't mind us making it usable um okay to be clear it wasn't unusable it just wasn't very modern we okay don't be a hater okay don't be a hater the point is no one seemed upset about that so we are experimenting while he's on vacation with taking that up another level well actually we're
experimenting with that next week yes while he's on vacation no he he comes back this Friday oh so we're just going to tell him hey you're here but you have no car no uh Honda Canada is getting him a brand new Civic for a week oh really yeah oh that's hilarious okay well anyway there I didn't know that but the point is uh we are going to be uh we're going to be upgrading a sound system I think on this one is that no that's next that's the one okay so what are we doing this time I forget uh Power L windows
power locks uh remote keyless entry right yes that's part of the power locks okay uh I don't remember what else a cabin air filter everybody go change your cabin air filter right now if you don't remember the last time that you did it they are disgusting they are absolutely horrific for a while oh yeah headlight upgrade so he's going to be going down the streets and he'll be able to see and hopefully not blind everyone else I don't remember what else and this was uh this was my idea in
order to make sure that nobody gets upset or jealous it comes with a catch I get to paint his car I didn't know that that's awesome yeah can I help yeah should be good I wish that the color of my car wasn't so bad so I could let you do that to mine or the color of my car is amazing all right I hate to interrupt it but we're going to go back to a little bit of auctioning our last auction ended with 494 on the backpack thank you very much I think it was spawny was the name I might have gotten
that wrong we're going to move on to our next water bottle I think we only have maybe like I think this is the second last one second last water bottle we might have to re auction the home one and that would be the last one but we're going to hold off a little bit got it okay our water bottle here we're going to try we're going to get people to sign it after the show because we have to just get through everything else here but it will be signed by members of the LTT staff uh the auction is going to go
live right now uh where the devil am I going to put this IQ Hub anyone got a big uh big IQ um idea for where to put this uh we could just kind of stuff it right there I'm not putting it on the back of the rad uh okay so this has to reach the front of this rad y okay so that has to go there this has to reach power this has to reach a USB header they don't ask for much do they okay I think I've got it I think I'm going to put it on the side of the power supply where normally the
modular interface would be here Andy I can get you a look at that here we go uh man oh God oh God all good oh no it stuck oh boy there uh yeah uh h no it's going to have to go deeper okay there yeah that's should be fine right yeah yeah okay here's the front USB  that nope all right I'll do it oh what good uh oh I got it and then these fans I guess I've actually never hooked up an IQ Hub you haven't oh wait I did I did it CES but that was kind of putting their system back together as opposed to
building from scratch when I did the video on back to front and Corsair ah there we go all right Alex would you like to auction something else off sure what do you want to do let's do the Doogie v3t so right here is a rugged phone for someone that wants all day and most of the next of the day and probably the day after that battery it's a what it it's that many milliamp hours you can buy "battery Banks smaller it's 10 ,800" milliamp hours has 66 W fast charging 108 megapixel Samsung sensor
for the main camera this thing right here it it does have Android 12 so that's not great and the mediatech dimity 1080 processor yeah dimensity dimensity y it's a weird phone yeah but like you could probably kill a man with it oh on our next dogy one that's my notes for it and the auction is live here's my note 9 for scale oh it also has 12 GB of RAM uh 256 GB SSD or storage not an SSD wow 120 HZ display do you think you could hammer a nail with it like oh for sure like it's
got the weight yeah it's got the weight for it as long as the head's wide enough that it's not just going to stab it like I you could definitely Hammer something home with that don't but or do or or don't it's yours you can do whatever you want with it that's true true we're not promising it won't break it though so that's the that's the point we need to oh you already did that yeah oh wow good work uh oh seriously did that peel just come off Midway oh boy oh boy now there's no there's no way
to get under it and I just clipped my nails oh you should have done that here so we could sell them oh my God and thank you to Hunter for winning the duif phone v3t at $510 damn I can't believe how generous everyone today oh what I was really concerned that people wouldn't like spend a bunch of money but I was really wrong speaking of that oh man this is the worst peel I love you but this peel is the worst peel do you know how to say that uh I don't know it depends what it is a oh no a
okay Zoe sure yeah it's a handheld gaming PC that is valued at $750 AMD 6800 that's that's the last gen last gen one 6800 U processor from AMD 16 GB of RAM 1 tbte SSD 65w hour battery and 65 wat Gan power delivery charger this thing runs Windows 11 and looks very very cool just look at this thing auction is live auction's live oh which one is this is this the like um hold on a second let me see this it's the a1l is it a special edition or something uh yes I think so um is it bad we're giving it
away yeah whatever it's for it's for charity should be fine yeah yep um I think it might be a special color way of it or something  enjoy this sticker is going to be the death of me okay I think I got all the pieces of it but but if you get this computer and there's still bits of Peel on the CPU Cooler my humblest and most sincere apologies it's character that's how you know it was built by lus yes that's hey I mean that a positive way no I just said it has character character uh okay where's our
GPU for this bad boy the Starfield uh we're going to need one more pcie power connector could I get could I get one more of those I thought I already put that in there you put one in quick thank you to uh Jay Hayden Ramirez for the aoso a1l at $750 they are the winner wow damn first MSRP no I think we had one other one earlier the first pixel bundle also the Logitech bundle was our backpacks have also been going for like 500 so like if we're not making it on the products we're making it on our products
heck yeah let's go yeah cuz we had 10 of them right yeah speaking of which you want to do another one yeah let's do another back okay we're going to do another backpack uh LTD store.com do it your in this box let's go I would open it up but then I have to put it right back in but all of them will be signed we'll get them signed either after or during the show all right $250 I'm fading lonus I'm sorry you're doing great I'm going to go inhale a burger one sec you can inhale a burger
you can try oh yeah I mean you can do anything make sure you turn off your mic oh yeah I'm going to turn off my mic no I want to be I wanted directly into the mic I want to hear that can you stop stop what uh stop not installing the Starfield GPU oh but that's torture you know I want it and now I have to it's for kids do you think they'd notice if I [Laughter]  sir probably not they wouldn't notice the kids wouldn't notice the person we s in the system to would well no we'll just be
like oops sorry no we won't we will do no such thing 7900 XTX honestly I think it's the prettiest graphics card that's been made in the last several years I love this thing you can have your thoughts on the game whatever it may be but this is a slick looking card y I have upside down you're doing great Elijah I'm trying you're very trying I'm so yeah we  no and thank you to digital media guy for the $449 winning bid on the LTD backs pack number seven heck yeah thank you very

we've got an in studio audience $5 $400 $6 I mean 400 might be liable it's at 390 on the hook I don't know we can make an exception it's sold for 390 to NJ it's us it's Lounge night we've got a bunch of got a bunch of peanut Galler ear over there we should get be getting work done what it's loung 6 it's 6:30 yeah my brother's I need oh I I eat be oh you have a burger you can inhale as well I should well I'll wait for Alex to eat and then I'll eat all right I don't need food um do we have where did the power
supply box for this system go probably near oh right here buddy sick I think we're ready to do a quick test on this one oh well do we can we start our next auction first before yeah absolutely all right we're also like we said Starfield GPU I is this a bundle Chase can we confirm or are these separate it has a bundle and it also has things that aren't here oh what else is it missing low profile a shock and a pop filter got it so the mic stand for the wave three and the pop filter as well
the low profile mic arm okay so we get a stream deck MK2 Starfield Edition looks pretty sick we get a wave three mic Starfield Edition pretty sick and then the the mic arm the wave shock mount and the wave pop filter they're stuck at the border uh why are they stuck I just need to give them Customs okay y Customs help Mike arm I'm  tired I'm never invited back for another stream yeah did anyone did anyone clear him for for stream appearances I did you did you vouched okay so now I know who's
responsible all right let's get the power I came workp and Alex was like like hey can you help with the stream and I was like yeah I think I should be free and he's like good cuz you're doing it I was just asking out of courtesy hey and thank you to um absolute Prodigy for the $76 winning bid on the Elgato Starfield bundle Starfield bundle very very cool all right keeps going up number go up let's go Burr Etc get your monitor really quick and I think we're just about ready to fire up this system this
is awesome looking well maybe not quite as clean as the last one but hold on let me just uh let me just fix that up a little bit here yeah just touched that okay that can go oh well okay that's uh I can't say I'm the biggest fan of how these tubes are like here like it's such and like there like that well yeah cuz the fans are over there not there did I say fans yeah you said I'm not the biggest fan oh thank you Elijah I'm doing my best man you are you know what your best is
truly it looks like a lot of effort the biggest um oh that's true thanks Alex would you believe that they're both professional writers I mean no I'm a professional Junior writer that's true well I guess that's as good as it's going to get all right no problem it's got that cool GPU in it though let's uh you know what I'm going to leave the peels on we'll leave the peels on for shipping and let's fire this thing up uh display is connected we need perip what' you call me uh we need peripherals where'
the peripherals go people keep moving things we're working on them no no you're doing great am I while you work on it maybe you should auction something off here we go call never mind ready and one two where's the power button there  is uh-oh oh is this going to be our first you're not plugged in buddy like at all well there's a problem right there gotcha oh man I was so busy checking if the extension cord in the power bar we should just do every video as a stream we've built four computers
now you know with how YouTube treats stream archives differently um algorithmically oh yeah go ahead Colin um honestly I've kind of considered streaming our edited videos just to see what happens they tend to get very low viewership out of the gate but in the long term they tend to do really well but what we've seen is it's mostly the really long ones that tend to do that so uh this video is kind of an experiment to do a really really long stream again and see if that is a
thing that we should do a 24-hour one a 24hour stream did you just volunteer 100% tape the tape 24 hours okay shout out tape to tape for real Alex is all being dismissive of it but it's really fun game if you tried it it's so good it was fun enough for me to get a call at 900 p.m. and drive like 45 minutes to Li's house to play it was pretty it was pretty fun we got a beta build that supports uh five player local multiplayer so every player on your team is a human controlled
player there's all these powerups you can like throw your stick at people and uh you can like fart and push them away so they can't body check you and all kinds of stuff the hip checking you know what you can also do yeah you can auction this uh oh oh yes I can the all for nothing bundle we've got a nothing phone 2A oh yeah well we've got the right one can see it clearly labeled here uh we've got a nothing phone 2A with a mediatech dimensity 7200 Pro 5G it's an 8 core processor it's got 12 gigs of RAM and 8
gigs of not Ram um 8 gigs of storage allocated it's got 12 gig of ram dual 50 megap cameras on the rear a 32 map front camera they rated at 1300 nits Peak "brightness and it's got a 5,000 Mah hour" batteries also comes with their nothing ear 2s uh you daily Drive these do you yeah I like them okay 24-bit high res active noise cancelling personal sound profile and they look oh God cool they do look really cool sick all right the retail value of this bundle is is $435 man their stuff is priced
reasonably wait wait wait wait it's not a 2A it's not a it's a phone 2 just says two right there oh so that's the better one why why notes wrong whoops because this one was stuck in shipping and it showed up literally an hour before we started stream oh okay so we made a slight oh never mind it's not a 2A yeah it's a nothing phone too well that's even better then yeah fantastic ignore all the specs except it is a 12 gig 256 config duration so make of that what you will what color is it should we at least
find out what color it is oh yeah you need to break the packaging that's why this one right here is Right ruined yeah I'm not going to open it I'm guessing it's white because this package is white and that's or this but you know cool there you go thank you nothing phone 2 not a 2A box okay all right all right all right look In fairness to me hold on can I have the box oh In fairness to me this was stuck here so  had all right did this work oh I guess I have to reset it yeah I guess so all 
Boop my fans are oh wait what happened to the thing spinning plug it in I plugged it in uh did you plug in the right one I I thought so build is going 925 for the whole nothing bundle and then I'm not sure if the US b c has to be plugged in as well but you can't even plug it in that is that's just not working that is true that's probably really bad for the uh the CPU hold on we'll figure it out uh oh this panel is on uh okay what oh what happened to all the accessories for this 
boy where' that USBC cable go here it is I found it I found the problem you got it y what's up look at what wasn't plugged in back here there's your problem right there fantastic uh do we have the chummy that goes into it I will in a moment uh nope uh yes nope yes nope yes yes I do I grabbed that cable twice really this one yeah oh all right well maybe you should have plugged it in one of those times got him oh but I had a chicken burger to eat are you going to plug this into it than go we did it it's
teamw work I heard it makes the dream work all right sometimes sometimes you just end up teaching someone something and it takes longer than if you just did it yourself oh my God come on come on no it may actually need the uh manual you got to light you're poed uh yeah the issue is that we want these fans to turn on I don't for this  boy there's no way that they need you to plug in the hub and the uh daisy chain to a front USB two header I find that I'm going to just try it in the other spot I find that
quite hard to believe but I also don't  get H is this pump working yeah if the pump's working why  fans I don't think so Alex I think that's an alternative one cuz we have the we have the Hub and then we have the IQ Link cable that goes up to the top of  radiator oh I remember okay yep no I figured it out uh which way did you put the fans on cuz we have to daisy chain from the  ah racking my brain here um oh boy oh dear yeah so I'm glad we put in all the screws on this rad power it off real quick that's why
the pump spinning in the fans aren't because the pump is powered and the fans aren't hm makes sense yep IQ that's a that's a lot of screws super cool just haven't really wow these are really long screws um do we want to do something else while this get fixed uh yeah we could do that should we auction some stuff yeah all right let's do it should we do some of the other builds oh yeah do one of the builds or should we do some quick items sure let's go through some quick items um our team is just
contacting people who have previously won so a little bit later um if people respond and say they are going to get the their bid through and figure it out later we'll we'll sort that out but if people we can't get a hold of them uh we may just have to push those through again okay perfect what do you got oh another one of those Pulsar X2 whand Edition these things right here are great 56 G super light Mouse want to pull it out I think you got to I'm absolutely going to this is number three
of five three of five this is three of five we have a couple more of these left but after that they've been going for pretty good prices though look at that designed by the well the whale design by the one and only Sarah but I personally daily drive a pulsar X2 fantastic Mouse highly recommend it and you can auction for it right now I think well you can bid for it right now you can bid for it on the auction I think I can use auction as a verb I just ate a whole Burger No
Bananas all right the fans all have to come off would you like me to work on this and you can try something else or yeah doesn't really make a difference we're all here until we all finished you want to start the next one I I can start the next one you're going you're going solo Elijah I believe in you I'm a solo boy or you can auction more stuff it doesn't matter I'll auction more stuff I have to wait for the current one to  finish nice you're doing good lines good work thanks Elijah uh this one went to
Chen for $342 i42 bucks I believe it is pending come back to it we've had a few that went to pending um work out like minutes later so it's not like a huge worry but we we'll get around it all right well we might as well just go right into our next one our next one Asus r G14 another laptop this "one is valued at $1,500 it's got the AMD" ryzen 98945 HS 1 TB SSD 32 GB of RAM and an RTX 4060 it's a 14in screen which will fit in your LTT backpack if you bought one of those earlier we're also going to
have a couple more later um 2880 by 1800 OLED 120 HZ screen and a 73w hour battery the auction for this starting now uh I would like to do a quick test on this before we actually scre that radiator back in just to you know just to see just to see but I think what we need to do is just give it the old switch the fans around I had to move the fans 180° and then now we're just going to go like that and then we're going to go like I believe these are reversible don't quote me on that
I'm certainly going to try plugging them in any which way though so I guess we'll see the Magic Smoke go flying if it's not I believe they are I've plugged that one into both and it's worked fine so  yep ha let's go oopsies I don't see any RGB and it's a Corsair product though I find that alarming yeah there must be RGB H those look very RGB oh yeah oh yeah  H it's also possible that the software just hasn't loaded yet so I don't know  yet normally you just get like generic RGB though
yes okay looks like it doesn't matter which way it goes in or which way it goes out super cool thank you Mike by the way $270 for the G14 laptop oh that's fantastic absolutely fantastic we could just plug in the USBC and see what happens yeah go for it oh it's a bit more difficult than normal that will be that will be a challenge don't worry small hands power to the rescue there you go we have a bit of a side question for you lonus yes sir do you want to get in on our Chipotle order our Chipotle
order you know what I'm good I think I will just get through it and get home and I'll something there oh do you mind um you know what it doesn't matter you can hot plug USB yeah ow gosh darn it concern it okay all right so we want to try that now sure why not I mean what could go wrong right okay I bet the manual says only use one of these while they finish that uhhuh we have another product the late prototype pen the note says this is the final prototype before they are headed
into production the LTT store bolt action pen as we talked about earlier made out of the failed screwdriver "shafts that we ordered a 100,000 of that" was not our fault that was it was not our fault tldr they boned us on that one "but 100,000 which we are turning into" pens and we're turning into some other projects and test stuff but volt action you pull that down got your pen out and you just like pretty sick I have one at my desk I don't I don't deal with like analog

that's my like try wings and stuff in it all right well we wait for that to post is it time to nope never mind oh what did you want I'm sorry I was going to start building our final computer uh you can work on that if you want but I was going to do another auction all right I'm going to get started on the final computer before I promise this is the last one Chase is this the last medium Noca  sec can't type it's okay it's okay yeah this is going to be the last this is going to be the last Mee
last medium knock through a hoodie it's going up for auction go for it very comfy lonus wore one earlier and he said it was comfy I did it is comfy very comfy can confirm auction starts now they're also really warm and I'm already dying of heat so I will not be putting it on right now I can put it on and you can get some of my sweat if you want o that would raise the value uh no no let's not go to a weird place any weirder than we already have in this stream we were talking about only fans earlier uh I  
aha there was also no CPU fan detection  great damn oh  all right radiator's going in this is it last machine uh where's my spec list at well whatever I can Wing this probably it's a 14900 K because everything's been a 14900 K so far on the Intel side except that first one probably it's got 64 gigs of RAM we're in a Corsair case so I'm going to assume it's Corsair Dominator titanium's I already saw the RTX 480 so this thing's going to be flipping fast not a 480 no the platinums
oh they do sorry dominator platinums dominator platinums 12 individually addressable capellic RGB LEDs though ddr5 6400 CL 38 okay so that's a pretty Speedy kit love to see it and what else we got going on here I'm going to assume I'm going to assume H oh sa could be sabrin it could be Corsair on the SSD uh you know what I'm going to go sain dang it it's Corsair we've got an mp700 another Gen 5 Drive oo "with oh wow 10,000 megabytes per second" yeah cameras that's flipping fast you
got to stop measuring in megabytes per second gigabytes now right holy cow and then you already you did claim it 4080 the Asus R stricks Edition look that 4080 look how beautiful that is you know what what what what sorry oh what was that that was me oh where's where's the other one what other one what what you looking for uh a camera another camera a camera Cera a camera well it's just a piece of paper because the camera's actually at the border oh oh we got it this is a big one oh
oh it sadly is not here but there's also ones right there that we can show you know those made it into the list so I might have tox3 oh uh yes uh that's not the one though uh that's the fx6 uh Colin do you mind grabbing an fx3 all right so Sony C reached out and wanted to participate which I have to say I I wasn't really expecting but wow absolute Bros I don't think they've ever done anything like this with us before but they came hard for this Charity Auction uh here it is so this one has
some extra rigging on it ignore that but uh we've got a Sony fx3 camera this is the same one that we use for our short circuit shoots we've taken these to CES computex they're absolute workhorses amazing image quality astounding low light performance like we've come to expect over the last I mean yeah realistically like 5 six years from Sony they are killing it when it comes to L light performance it'll shoot 4K 120 or up to 240 FPS 108p um 12 megapixel fullframe cosos xmor R sensor these retail for3
$700 and ours it's stuck at the border so I only have this piece of paper and a a very used one but yours will be brand new and is that live now Chase live now it's live let's go shout out Sony C that's really cool oh you should say how much it's worth I did we did "$3,700 yeah absolutely sick camera now I" get to start on my last sick build of the day yet another 14th gen core I9 14900 K 24 cores absolutely outstanding gaming performance we've got a z790 Tai Chi light from ASRock this time around
mixing it up on our motherboard vendors it's been the Asus show up until now oh no I see we salvaged this from our warehouse we did well you're getting a piece of LT this one oh no special is certainly a word oh boy so this board has gone places and seen things um that's why it has insulation on the back of it this is the one that we used for I believe the city's skylines to build uh where we went Subzero with our Chiller and put Shmo all over the motherboard it's not conductive or damaging
but it is Sho nonetheless and cleaning it off is a lot harder than putting it in a system and auctioning it to you so a big thank you to lives for trauma for purchasing the Sony fx3 at "$3,570 it's a good" deal fantastic awesome oh my God sick this CPU socket um check this out Andy does this ad value I'm not sure I've cleaned a couple of these when I was in logistics uh it does not Alex yeah when we did this video If I recall 14th gen was just just coming out and Gary had our only 14th
gen chip or something so does this have a 14th gen compatible bios in it or no that's a really good question cool we're going to find  it's okay things have already gone off the rails cuz this computer's no longer posting oh was it posting before it was "cool Dominator Platinum 32 gig 6,400" megat transfer per second getting this going in here oh boy see I knew things were going too well I knew it I had a feeling o no not that kind of feeling okay I had a feeling things were going
to go off the rails at some point I honestly didn't think think we'd make it this far we're doing pretty well dude we're doing so well yeah I'm surprised it's not midnight I told you 9:30 what time is it now Dan no 9:30 no way there's no way we got this no I mean there's no way full stop we've got this not the other thing that you were thinking is it no way or no wave h no way wave no way wave so that one's dead huh it's not dead it's just not functional at the  see pining for
the pining for the F he's Stone  is well let's do another auction then shall we yeah cuz we have so much more to go through uh Chase we have one more noct to a hoodie right yeah I believe this is the size large is our last one the last no the last noct hoodie I think so many people have this internally just because nocta gave us a wack ton and everyone just found so comfy so they were Bros and we're going to send more by auctioning it for charity thank you come on balls what are
you doing I don't have pliers don't worry about it I'll go get we have pliers what we had pliers right here why do you need pliers do we have pliers where are they you mean snippers no why do you need pliers oh I see why you need pliers yeah I need pliers okay Line's left that right there is in the way as you can probably tell SSD no like screw   this ha why is there two I don't understand why but  right I really don't understand this like I've never seen this before even
though I have used this board so I've definitely done this but I don't get it a big thank you to Casey 7241 for the purchasing the last knock to a hoodie at $6 wow $56 for the hoodie yeah fantastic thank you so what yeah probably a good time to mention too that we are uh what are we at give me one second here I went a little early we are at "$2,476 on the BC Children's Hospital" donation page which is amazing thank you guys we're almost at 50% of our goal so you know $5 goes a long way and uh if
you can't participate in the auction go and check out the link below to donate to the um or is it on the side now is the donation how is the whole YouTube page thing oh yeah YouTube changed their like page now right yeah it might be below it might be to the side but there's a link that you guys can go donate and if you are watching on one of the other platforms there is also a link to go find the whatnot stream and that's where we're doing all these auctions huge thank you to them because they've
decided to wave all fees for this to help go towards BC Children's Hospital okay actually do we have a final talking points for them I think  haa do you want to do this sure oh BC Children's Hospital number three a common misconception is that the government funds all or most of the hospital costs a number of programs at BC childrens that um make it a worldclass hospital are partially or almost fully donor funded uh child and youth therapeutic services for example OBC childrens is the only Hospital in
the province devoted exclusively to the care of children 1 million kids including some of the sickest and most seriously injured count on the hospital for Specialized Care that they can't get anywhere else every year more than "138,000 patients visit the hospital and" they have one of the best Childhood cancer survival rates in Canada and uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cancer so especially when uh kids have it um let's get these guys funded let's go uh we've got our SSD in I think we're ready to get the motherboard
mounted we are making progress this is our final computer is anyone else excited about that W yeah speaking of uh you know getting kids funded or like the BC Children's Hospital we're past "$40,000 on whatnot right now which is" incredible and that's still with some stuff pending so it's it's incredible do we have that like on the stream in any way I don't know if they're able to see it um I I I maybe Chase can confirm is that something um yeah if you have the if you have what
not you can see it but we don't have it available on the main stream I don't believe um not sure if that something it's available through the whatnot you just go there yeah we didn't do an overlay at the moment okay do you see these trippy new fan screws from Corsair what the heck yeah it's like one two screws maybe one or two turns one turn that's pretty cool wow look at that threading that's  who yep uh where are my motherboard screws at did did did oh I might have 
them thanks Alex one second they're also power supply screws nice we're doing great we're doing great here what are the odds of this board posts hi yeah thanks it's it's like the only tested component that we've had here that is true really does look like it's been through hell though it has but it went super cold so it couldn't have gone through hell I mean every once in a while I've heard about hell having cold days like my wife married me what is that a song again no it's not a
song or another artist that I don't know about no just an expression means it'll be it means something is a very unlikely outcome okay thank you like me moving to non Junior Raider you're going to get there not with that attitude hey Alex Believes In Me All right what else do I have to do CPU here we go man this is not going to be the prettiest of our builds Alex yes it is no it's really not it's going to be so nice looking that people are going to be like wow I can't believe that they
put in that much effort to making it look good after streaming for that many hours I really thought they just phone it in now you've set the bar there which is  which is great yeah no we got this though no it's fine we'll fix it in post every screw fix it in post yeah I mean everyone knows these are pre-recorded anyway so if they were pre-recorded yeah you know we wouldn't be able to say pre-recorded oh that's a good one right there we're just waiting for Chase to get the listing ready but this is the
lambo screwdriver okay you got a big cheeky smile but here you go in the classic Lambo colorway with the green accent ring the green cap the pink selector and the pink handle lius ended up building not this one but the exact same colorway at LTX which he uses daily in his kit cuz of course I do this is my this is my specialty bits driver so it's got uh kind of my TR WIS and weird uh weird bits but the auction is up for this one on whatnot it is live I this one's like  stop it's a cool driver though it is
very cool I like this color wave wave no I said it right I did say it right and then I doubted myself that's your problem Elijah you got that you got that mad self yeah I'm man you're not supposed to look at me at at least you got to at least get weird with it the camera how's the screwdriver doing it's still going up it's still up for 4 seconds left $481 and it looks like it just sold to high voltage we'll make sure the transaction goes through wow process thank you very much High Vol
very much high voltage $480 for the lambo screwdriver pretty freaking cool someone in chat's like 500 for a screwdriver you guys are dumb it's not 500 for a screwdriver it's 500 to a really worthy cause and a screwdriver by the way there's a screwdriver don't worry about it IM imagine being like charitable donation you're dumb we've reached out to uh some of the people who had payments pending just a quick update yes um we're going to be trying to put some of those items in the
buy now section so they can just go through and try and purchase them but um they will be in that section until ideally they get purchased by someone so just giving you an update yeah it's a little bit of a while West this is the first time we've done something like this so okay we're going to try and get it done though but okay yeah your mic right Chase yeah M okay good just making  that look what you've done Elijah I do  nothing that's a hot take Elijah did nothing wrong what do you mean a hot
take my goodness yeah yeah 100% I'm taking we're going to get Ariana down here to give you a talking to about bullying it's like 700 p.m. bro she drove home still here yeah she's in Lounge of thing yeah she might be at loung now fine I'll just text her tell her to come down yeah you got to admit for HR she's pretty cool she's all that's where they get you can we have they get you can we have an official hurt feelings report um my list is 30 pages long my feelings are hurt every day okay you guys
actually probably shouldn't be joking about that I'm just saying well let's do another screwdriver then for auction yeah that's that's like just one minut Chase needs one minute but I will introduce it still it is the extra long shaft AKA a long boy it is literally according to the words here literally just a standard screwdriver but with an extra long shaft has a knock to a ratchet cover this if if your normal screwdriver wasn't TSA safe this is definitely not TSA safe 100% will not make it in my
experience the TSA will let your normal screwdriver through about two out of every three times which means he's lost lost one it means he's lost Le two cuz you had to be able to make that ratio no I did two connections and on the third one they took it can we compare it to a regular one and then let me gra a regular one I I got one in my pocket all right we're starting it all right this is the regular length one it's it's got like what what would you say another like inch on the long
boy that's a lot which I've heard is a lot it is it's oh yeah that's like an  yeah yeah he's he's got that math down pat yeah pretty freaking cool extra long shaft how' grade 12 math go for you like I said only reason I graduated teachers went on strike actually math was one of the  52% what it's worth that's better than my first year Cal grade is like 9 is evil okay all right it's like one of the few subjects I was good at that in physics yeah look how I turned out well you've got the hair
what does that what do you mean what does that have to do well just the you've got the like physics hair the mad scientist look I thought you don't have to look angry mad scientists are not necessarily angry oh well they're mad like doof and Schurz he seems like a pretty happy fellow overall if I had a nickel for every time I was compared to Dr DZ I'd have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice that's a dof quote what about every time you're compared to Sam bman freed I could
afford to retire if I had a nickel for every time someone but could you afford  bail my goodness it was one Reddit post and then Taran every time he walks by me he's like what's up Sam what's up SBF and I'm like Taran I've talked to you like three times you're amazing but  sell I'm sorry I just coughed in the mic um yeah the long boy just sold for $341 to Justin wow to Justin would with an L not not an N at the end oh yeah I was like Justin why didn't he why did he buy it he works
here he could just but anyways Justin different thank you very much for buying the long boy very very cool um oh what up cool yeah no again I forgot I haven't played around with these IQ link ao's much uh I forgot that you don't have to plug in anything by the CPU socket it just all runs through here and then it's all hey how you doing uh it's all handled by IQ link so I was I was looking for the RPM monitor wire all that stuff there isn't one uh what I do need though is my thumb screws so yeah

it's at least a little easier learn from your mistakes kids yep hire Elijah once what I mean technically you hired me twice cuz I was hired into the logistics department and then hired into the writing Department technically I didn't hire you either time which means I've technically been hired once fired once and then  um all right let's put W how's the mous doing Chase one second we're just confirming okay we're confirming the sale and sold to uh bobe for $370 wow $370 I these Pulsar mouses like
mice oh my goodness these Pulsar mice have definitely generated like over "$1,000 now and we still have one more" that is incredible fantastic what else we got hit me I'm working on I'm sorry I'm one man I can only build this computer so slow oh oh we have another we have another doobie or DOI oh wait what Doogie S100 this was that like brick phone that you said could kill a man uh no this is a different one I think is it a different one yeah no it's it's a different one
but the same so then oh okay oh my oh gosh what a good guy this could kill two men can we try there's three of us in right now read the notes all right I spent so much time writing all of those "10,800 mAh battery 108 megapixel Samsung" sensor for the main camera primarily though it will shoot at 12 megapixels unless you specifically want the highres because there's a lot of light uh it's a large sensor though things will look okay it's got 12 gigs of RAM 256 gigs of storage a 120 HZ full HD Plus display
and if you hit someone with it it would hurt a lot more than a normal phone because it basically has a battery Bank it uh the retail value for this one is $300 is we think at least it was at some point and that one is up right now it already oh right now it's got 10 seconds left 10 seconds left let's go this is insane yeah oh yeah my brother actually has one of those phones and loves it do like people like work in construction is that like kind of the Target or what what yeah he does like scaffolding
actual Killers to like have a blunt weapon he he drives from can more to Fort Mac and and doesn't charge his phone yeah and and just doesn't have to worry about his phone at all uh that one just went to e uh for $445 but sale is currently pending we'll loop back if Happ 441 you said ni fantastic all right very cool all righty should we go into another one Alex yeah do it you want do uh are we supposed to be putting more fans in this I guess uh oh I'm kind of getting that Vibe yeah there's a lot of
fans right here uh oh well there's a lot of fans everywhere right there a lot of fans right there thanks Elijah right there oh and um quick shout out to um Xavier Romeo they scooped up the random Frank P bundle from earlier the one with the one of three mouse pad I don't remember it's the same person but we had to put it up for buy it now for the price that it was originally bid on so someone got it how much was it uh I think it was like about it was $400 fantastic crazy awesome that's a good bundle
all right should we do this one Alex let's save that for a little bit o we'll tease them but we can do oh this is a good one right here this one's a really good one holy cow that's a lot of stuff okay okay oh my goodness so we've been doing some Bob Ross I'm going to go over here cuz I need a table to put this all down on my goodness we've been doing some Bob Ross mouse pads earlier in the Stream and we have another one here but this is a whole bundle what does it include includes open back headphones
holy cow that case they are beautiful these things are awesome take a look at these absolutely wonderful I have notes I don't remember exactly what it is it's  sorts oh wow that's a lot of notse yes is the uh Caspian open back headphones they have 50 mm k tin Dynamic drivers hand hand Stitch sheep skin right here what yeah feels really good oh wow yeah also uh the oak is sored from the or sourced from the cassus mountains I don't know where that is but it's very nice looking wood also we have an apost
white fox Eclipse mechanical keyboard so that's this guy right here it looks  so this keyboard that we have right here retails for $140 but we have a key cap set that goes along with it I just saw the price $281 so your key caps are like almost twice as much are worth twice as much as the keyboard these things right here there are people out there for whom that will make a lot of sense though look at that sick they look so good look at those there's it's designed by hetian produced
by gmk and they're double shot ABS plastic they look wow so good so just  this or not you can just keep the white if you really want to wow and these are the same people and then the mouse pad now we got earlier the Bob Rass mouse pads these are the same people L yeah so huge thanks to apos for sending all of those most pads and this right here total value of $951 for this bundle the it's live now yeah very very cool I think this is our last I might be wrong on this again
Chase do we have any more Bob Ross mouse pads after that's the last Bob Ross mouse pad yeah that's the last one it's included with the bundle okay oh it's going in here as well that is really Co r oh system work died yes it was the issue was I had enabled xmpp and we're having issues with I guess getting everything to run at their full speed it worked with two sticks with XMP yeah with four sticks that's a little questionable okay that's awesome so it's a working computer we're not shipping you a bad
computer and we are going to auction it once this uh apos bundle is done fantastic wow that apos bundle's going  yeah all right yeah uh and don't worry we'll figure out the RGB on the fans before we ship it to you I could probably look it up now but realistically I think we've been live for 5 hours or something like that so we'll probably just figure that out offline all righty so that sale ended on that epos kit 1514 s's still pending so we'll wait for that to go through and if
it doesn't we'll try to re auction it but I guess line is should we should we auction off this uh Starfield PC or we booot it in uh hey Alex yeah what's up were you expecting the female housing for the front USB 3 connector to just detach uh is it not yeah there you go wait what that happens a lot you can just push it back I had seen that before yeah I've never seen it on a right angle one I know how it got off how did that happen I don't know why were you taking that out I wasn't oh I was just like
moving the cable a little bit came well that's awkward okay well let's start by putting this back on oh God I hate these pins they're so fragile oh no oh no oh no oh no okay well um never take that off can't run it cuz AMD drivers there so we got an error sick perfect Flawless victory yeah we'll test that USB port before we ship the system or the rather both of them the the two front USB ports that are connected to that header all right well we were going to show you gaming on this
AMD system but because this is our only AMD system and we're using the same boot drive we got an error that just said hey wrong drivers Chief uh so we're going to we're going to power down the system we're going to take that boot drive out so that way we can put it in our last system show that one posting this computer will be working with an SSD and everything windows installed for you guys when we ship it out um but we can't game on it right at this moment but oh my goodness look at that GPU I am so
jealous of whoever is going to win this one we have we auctioned it yet we have not I was waiting for you cuz you you're the main man Li yeah go over there we already we already sent you built them a Compu it's live now but you want to go over the specs I'm I'm working on it I'm working on it Alex do you want to do the IQ Hub then um we've got the 7800 x no I'm an idiot you're talking about the CPU ignore me uh we've got the 7800 x3d um we've got I believe it's 64 gigs
of Dominator titanium memory we've got a Radeon 7900 XTX Starfield Edition these were only done as either prizes or media kits these were never actually sold retail uh we've got a I believe it was a th000 watt power supply but don't quote me on that yep rm1000x power supply uh bunch of RGB it's us using Corsair IQ link uh for all three of these fans as well as for the CPU Cooler we'll get that running before we ship it out to you and of course it's in this gorgeous case from height Starfield boxes as well

Riser got the wife wondering if I am ever going to be done working today hi lady the good news is we raised over "$45,000 for BC Children's it's going to" be over 50 with this one I'm not going to see my children tonight but hey at least um yeah I think so okay good night 9:30 no no Dan we got this we got 90 seconds left and we're at "$5,900 wow we're making a really good" time this is this is great oh boy I love vertical you think we're going to break six knock on wood 59 so intuitive to
"install we're going to hit 6,000 who can"  "$6,000 absolute mad Lads one minute to" go I'm working on it I'm working on it I have to take our boot drive back out so  100 nering on this shaft is very impressive where can I get one of these screwdrivers oh I don't know 6150 40 seconds to go why you've lost your spunk I've lost my sponsor no spunk my spunk no I I made a good joke and you just went 250 30 seconds to go do you think we can do 65 in the last 20 seconds of course we can 20 seconds

I wouldn't have even had any idea what price to set for it like seeing how much people are willing to donate for it this really maximizes the amount that we can donate at the end of the day uh how's the just straight up donations doing Dan Chas oh yeah we are at "$2,883 in just donations so check out" the BC Children's Hospital listing below our goal for the straightup donations is five grand guys if you can get us there I'll match it so donate away yeah linked under the video whether
you're watching on Twitch or YouTube or  "5,000 come on Chase let's no I no like" now so keep the camera on Chase Chase keep an eye on it they got to do it now let's go pressure on boys don't look at that don't look at that look at that now look at it now I just want to see that number go up up every time I refresh please let's see oh there it is went up let's go1 that's more like it 100 bucks let's go come on guys I'm the wife's not here I want to open the wallet how we doing we're getting there

retail for this one was over just around the "$5,000 Mark so if we can get there that" would be incredible I believe that one was "$5,400 and change wow that's the MSRP of"  "components $600 $5,600 according to Matt" so very cool that auction it's live now it is live now you guys can bid on "it is climbing 3,000 4 bro oh you're" holding my "$5,000 holy cow we're almost at" MSRP no that is "incredible $5,200 this one has a five" minute timer okay I want to check in on how we're doing on the donations though
Chase where we at okay refresh 428 that's more like it that's what we're talking about thank you very much  "$782 782 bucks let's go $4,500 we only" need $500 yeah I need 72 of you to do 10 bucks guys come on wait what it just went up oh that's fantastic we wow we only need 497 4793 27 I should just demand you guys throw money at things more often this is fantastic this is working  go all right wow thank you everyone that was quick it took us forever to do like the first three Pips of that and then we
C is is this still going up it's probably still going up click it click  6548 freaking awesome keep refreshing keep going all right if we go up to 10K I'll match it keep going let's go hold on you just changed the rules I can change the rules whenever I damn please "it's his channel for Pete sake 7,000" let's go spend my money and yours it's two to one you will never get better value out of a donation 7146 okay sometimes IHOP has two for one pancakes but all right we're
going to jump back over to the build the iOS Asus Rog back to front build the "very first one we did it's at 5,700" currently 3 minutes left on this "computer it's at 5,700 sick this was the" first computer we did in the Stream it has a 4090 which isn't in it but it's because we're getting ready for shipping and everything uh the 1 12200 watt power supply this case is like $500 holy cow it weighs like a boat it weighs like a boat how else would you say that no I can't argue with you 
please don't hurt yourself why that's kind of my character art now no no no no no we sold his helmet we sold the helmet already oh God which sold for like $650 the guy in chat was like yes that  it 2 minutes to go two minutes left on the auction for this computer thank this computer is pretty sick as lonus and Alex are powering through our fifth computer here we got this we still have other stuff left to go after this including some more backpacks an Elgato kit I think I see another
prototype screwdriver let's start eating some backpacks I think we have a we can't we have to wait for this one to finish but then we'll do a backpack we'll do a backpack next and we'll get Lions to sign it all right why not sounds good I'll open it 90 seconds left still at 5700 how we doing with those actually like pretty solid okay value even the donation page for BC Children's Hospital is at going to refresh you hold on hold on hold on I'm coming I'm coming  "$1,150 all right all right that's more"
like it guys thank you so much for your generosity that puts us at a total now with whatnot can I have a look at where we're at with whatnot yep so we're at "5200 there we're at 52,000 excuse me" "52,000 so we're at almost" "$65,000 which in Canadian rubles is over" "80,000 this has been an incredibly" "successful event oh plus the 10,000 I'm" throwing in so we're we're actually "knocking on the door of 100,000 Canadian" I think we should probably set that as our kind of final goal here then so we
don't quit till we get there which means uh if you ever want Dan to go home we got 30 seconds left on this amazing system you got another 300 bucks to make it six grand well while we wait for that lus do you have time to sign my backpack do of course let's do this we will be auctioning this backpack off right after all the backpacks will be signed by me at least some members of the LTT staff even if we don't catch it on camera don't promise the whole thing there's like a hundred people here now no no I
said some I said some 10 seconds left  know we're at 5750 8 seconds we see  5750 Jaz 2575 the payment went through  5750 for the first computer we built on stream today 5842 I may not have been aggressive enough in my target here because if doing some quick uh Mental Math can you go back to the uh BC Children's page so we're at 58 428 "we're up to almost 12,000 here so that" "puts us at 70,000 plus my 10 puts us at" "80 I think we've already cracked 100,000" Canadian uh yeah I think this probably
Merit a uh Round of Applause thank you  much big day and we still have more and we still have more we're not done yet backpacks all right we do backpack send a backpack I'll talk about it once you send it yep send the backpack backpack is going live I think we still have a couple more of these after more two more after this one this one has definitely been signed by lonus all of them even if we don't catch it on camera will be signed by some members of the staff we'll try make sure
I get them just my office there you go we'll just throw 10 backpacks in Linus's office it'll be a short we'll do a YouTube short how many backpacks can fit  these retail for 250 us just on our store but obviously with Linus's signature I think I made the joke earlier it's about 100 but thank you for that well people might be tuning in they didn't see the joke I need to repeat it it was definitely worth repeating professional writer here  correction I'm just a weed Junior all right well that sale is
pending uh it looks like it might not have gone all the way through but we'll wait we'll move on to something else in the meantime how much would did it go for you're covering the the bottom there so sorry if it goes through it was $512 thank you very much but we'll move on to something else real quick and just a quick reminder um to anyone who's auctioned or bit on an item in one uh we are going to be throwing some of those items eventually in the buy now section so you can go back in and try and snag
it again at the price if you had a transaction issue or something but doesn't possibly stop someone else from snagging it so you never know very cool this one is missing some of the peels is this one also battle hardened did we use this in a video uh we've used a lot of graphics cards 4080 this might be our launch card I think Matt just said the one we got for the launch sick it looks like there's about four items in the buy now tab oh there is can we read off what those four items are in the buy now tab
yeah if you guys want to check something out in the buy now tab what do we got yeah we have the Google Hazel bundle so it's the pixel 8 128 gig uh with all the other additional items uh we have the HP Omen case 45 L the main gear mg1 pre-built and then the red magic 8s guys get that main gear pre-built it's where is where is it yeah it's oh go grab it mat sticker bomb one the sticker bomb one with Sarah's custom bread sorus front panel you don't want to miss that you probably won't get another one of
those so like that is a one of one wow I guess oh here it is Matt's just brought it in yeah there it is I guess we'll come all the way around with it oh my goodness put it on the back here Andy hopefully you can kind of see it and that can be yours for "$2,637 sticker bomb the heck out of the" side panel and main gear has these interchangeable magnet panels it's got the first pixelated bread sorus look how cute is that one that one is did you find and then we've got one more here as
well so you can swap out whichever one you want look cute he is look how cute  is okay  now this piec is coming together fantastic it's very close very very close I'm getting tired this this thing here are some of the other Buy It Now stuff just so we can go over it like Chase said we had the pixel 8 Pro which one was this this was a Hazel kit yeah yeah cool pixel Watch 2 it also comes with the pixel Pro buds a case for the phone and two lens is that apparently then you can make
your main camera lens into a wide angle lens which is pretty sick this one's in the Buy It Now page for how much Chase do we know uh for that one it's 1438 MSRP but by now it is "1,290 bucks off you get 200 bucks off" all of these items and they can match you know you got the matching phone you got the matching watch you got the matching ear buds pretty sick that's that's the P bundle not the Hazel bundle oh well that's what I you said Hazel showed porcelain well Chase told me it
was Hazel oh well sorry there's a Hazel bundle somewhere then okay set me up for failure not the pro you did it to yourself that was my bad what it's been a long day guys it's been a very long another item in the bi it now was this red magic 8s Pro it's like a gaming phone it's pretty sick you can buy it in the Buy It Now section oh this this the one from the short circuit I think you did a short circuit on it I think so yeah this is the one that actually has a cooling fan in it like what
$841 who does it's $841 in the Buy It Now red magic pretty freaking cool go check that out but we should move on to another auction item yep which I have here if you want oh the very early noctua prototype screwdriver apparently this was before the final color scheme the accent ring was mil out of an end cap the orange bit holder from before we changed it to White oh here and the official knock to a bit set I have two oh our official ones yeah I have two official ones so it shows you the color
scheme is uh not quite right uh um oh yeah I didn't even and uh these have a white bit holder um here if you close it so you could see it yeah it's yeah it's not yeah it's not correct man my my screwdrivers are very beat up well you use them everyday line yeah I know so we're going to be putting this one up for auction I think it's going right now oh hold on fantastic it's already at $250 early prototypes we've been a lot of giv away a lot of prototypes auctioned off sorry not given auctioned
off a lot of prototypes here today this is another one I think we have one more prototype thing we have one awful prototype I love that we will definitely be going through that let's do that awful well no we got to do something not a prototype next but we'll let this one go or we could just do the really by prototype right now do we have like a Ste for last thing uh oh we still got someone rebid again it's at 262 for the KN to a proty pretty freaking cool buy the red  with no just I mean if we see the
purchase yeah I don't see a problem cuz if someone who does buy it doesn't want the signature right yeah we'll do it we'll do it after the guy puts the sale through 100% we'll get it signed very cool wow still going up auctions and it's sold we'll make sure the transaction goes  "$322,000 looks like he sold he's bought" the phone as well wow he bought the phone okay and he asked for was that the guy who asked for it to be signed let's get the phone signed thank you very much
getting the KN to a screwdriver did he want the actual phone or did he just want the Box signed I feel like if you sign the phone it might do both both sure why not big maybe what do you think goes well Dan do you think the silver Sharpie or the gold Sharpie that would probably be a gold gold Sharpie kind of thing yeah all right we'll try to get are the fingerprints included need to move this huh are the finger that's why I was going to ask for a microfiber cloth I mean we can include the fingerprints so
you can steal our DNA good catch but got a dirty one steal our ID lus I'm tired I'm doing my best buddy hi tired I'm I tell my kids yeah some Welches there you go can you sign this phone the guy said he would buy it if he if you signed it and then he immediately bought it I need a gold Sharpie sure I hope it stays on this glossy back not okay um maybe on the screen though we can also do the Box let's do the box cuz that is uh not going to work um can you do like the edges yeah I

we'll get all the RGB configured in software before we ship it out or I don't know you can decide if you even want to install RGB software maybe we'll leave that up to you but either way it's it is all hooked up via IQ link uh this one is functioning ah there's a Windows desktop that's what I like to see we're going to leave the peels on so you guys can uh enjoy a nice nons scratched perfect pristine glass experience when you open this up but that looks fantastic I want to take a moment here
before he does that to shout out all the hardware partners that sent everything today uh exus and corer came through big time uh Intel sent 80% of the CPUs AMD sent over that CPU GPU um what man what else we had Logitech we had sa with all the SSD sa with all those ssds we had stuff alien Weare alien Weare main gear Sony cameras yeah we've got another big camera we're going to save that that okay we're saving that but we do have that but there's been ah man thank you to every partner here yeah we have a one
of 100 Mouse oh what's this the Pulsar X2 so I kind of lied when I said we had one more but we had one more of the the that gen like that model kibuts suuchi M muen okay I'm not even I feel like Chas something about this whatever it's anime it's anime so it's a very limited edition uh Demon Slayer oh one Demon Slayer they've got a whole collab they have a bunch of them on their store but this one is not wow there's one of 100 wow okay well I guess we should open it yeah we should that's a nice
Mouse no it's fine it's fine it's good it's good they all do that don't worry yeah all right very very cool okay so that one's up now it should be up now retail value is 95 but that's misleading yeah it's definitely worth more 56 G  cool you think we can break 400 with this $400 5 seconds for 391 anybody else got another 10 bucks come on come on come on come on there we go sold $391 wow TJC amazing fantastic I would congratulations very very cool oh he's so  right okay what else have we got well do
you want first we've got to show this system "working we've got three 3,000 FPS in the"  got this bill total value $556 5500 holy cow that's an expensive computer at "$55,000 our notes for it is Corsair sent" us Corsair sent us a whole bunch of stuff and they want to specifically show off their 6500 X mid tower case okay maybe we should close the panels so people can kind of see what it looks like then uh do we have the do we have the top panel yes okay I'm really not going to take the peel off because I
really do want you to get the glass and PR condition uh really easy Cable Management though is this back to front compatible it looks like it has extra punch yes super cool so some of the BTF um uh boards and gpus that you guys saw today from Asus uh this is a compatible case from Corsair results in I mean obviously this build is pretty clean but those BTF builds are super clean and you can use that Hardware in this case it's as you can see compatible with conventional Hardware too it's really cool the way
that Corsair did that we did a video in booth on kind of the this BTF Trend and where it's come from where it's going back at CES so that's probably worth checking out if you want to learn a little bit more about this in fact this is the case I built in there I think probably oh did that just turn off did you just kick it yeah that was my fault I thought it was the computer I was like oh that was the power bar talking about you know Corsair and they're good computers and it turns
off anytime you're live that kind of stuff you know does happen even if it is good quality stuff they make good computers but they do need power yeah they oh no that's their heal no well we've defeated you Corsair we found out you need AC power H okay what this was the one we teased earlier this one not that one we already did that one yeah we already did this one no this one yes never mind I lied wait no we did this one another one we did that one which one did we do three we did the
three three so you just crumbled up my my notes for the one we need that's the one that we need yeah this is the one we need yeah Sony cine coming in clutch again with the fx30 we have one here this is our main talkie-talkie camera we use on short circuit it's been there since the channel started do we have one hard to like take it off oh is that the only one we have yes because again this one got stuck we're waiting for it oh one uh no no don't rip it out they look the same as fx3 but like smaller
sensor yeah fx3 except smaller sensor it's just the camera body it retails for "$1,600 oh and this is fun we're going to" take one of our handles that we've used in our shoots and we're going to include that oh very cool with it very very cool okay so you will get oh is this the body well this is an fx3 fx3 okay so the fx30 looks basically the same uh so you're going to get one of the the fx30 and then it's going to have one of our handles and then I guess does it come with a handle so we're just going to
swap out the other one B basically you're going to get a used handle from LT from LTT that was used to shoot our videos uh just to add a bit of a personal touch to it so retail value "$1,600 and that one is live thank you" very much Chase thank you very much Sony sin as well yeah yeah CNY sin no not thank you SNY Sony who for real though thank you very much Sony and everyone else who has helped contribute of course especially you guys do we have a few more things do we have

fantastic wow we are at how much Chase go back to that page please we just broke $ "73,4 180 on whatnot and then on the" actual BC uh donation page we "$1,075 plus Linus's 10K that he is" matching I'm getting emotional sorry are "we going to hit $100,000 US we might we" might probably try all right well I think the next piece we just broke 100 Grand Canadian on whatnot alone yep heck yeah so yeah I think we're going to do "100,000 us let's make sure we get there" "we're at 22,000 plus we got this system"
so let's do it let's break it right now let's do okay so spec recap do we want to do the system or the alien wear bundle first uh do you want to do you want to close off on the system cuz we can do that not let's do the system let's do the system let's do the system now let's break it now so we've got a 14900 K we've got 30 2 gigs of Dominator Platinum memory we've got an RTX 480 uh I mean I think that's most of the pertinent specs I think it's an hx1200 high power supply yes it is I love this
got Andy come you got to see this you got to see this we're playing Doom Eternal right now on this system with an RTX 480 in it the fan is not even spinning that's how efficient this bloody thing is uh any who the total retail value of Corsair showcase build here um they're showing off their 6500 X Tower is $5 5560 us and a lot of that is the like super high-end fans we have not configured the software my deepest and most sincere apologies corer it's been a very long day and we really do need to
go home but don't worry we're going to get that configured before we send the system out let's get this live and see how much we can raise I was also told oh yeah go sorry yeah uh if we hit 100 Grand us we're going to be auctioning your shirt my shirt the one you're wearing right now the one I'm wearing yes fun fact this shirt is a prototype shirt even better we never released this shirt are you okay with that to my knowledge I it's actually one of my favorite shirts but I would never say maybe not I would
never say no for charity so yes okay the shirt you can have the shirt off my back when we break 100K of actually approved transactions they've got to go through I need to see that number now I feel bad no no no it's fine it's worth it no no it's fine it's worth it yeah no Sarah did a bunch of really cool colorways of this design and I I believe this is one of the ones we never actually made but I was like that's nice I will be taking that and then I wear it and then Nick
gets mad at me because I'm repping merch that we don't actually sell well now we're pleasing Nick and we're getting 100 Grand US for sick kids well that computer just broke "$6,000 oh my gosh it did so and there's" still four minutes left in the auction well that was quick uh why don't we take this opportunity to show you guys what our next item is going to be we've got one more of these alien wear bundles $500 in total value we've got their 720h headset we've got their uh Pro
wireless gaming keyboard and we've also got their Pro wireless gaming mouse the retail value of this bad boy is around $500 uh this will be the next one and then I believe our very last item is going to be a pretty unique piece of LT fumble history um yeah we we'll get to that in a moment first let's get this computer done uh is that is that it I there is still some stuff in the Buy It Now section oh yeah so head to the Buy It Now section on whatnot I think there are some of the
screwdrivers there's some hoodies there are some screwdrivers are gone but we're going to list a um cashmir hoodie and a woman's 3D down hoodie as well I don't have a price so oh wow these are very prototyped what do you think we should list it on buy it now for okay this has a story um um you're going to put these on by it now yeah I mean unless you want to auction it these both have stories so the 3D down jacket super cool jacket um way out hits its weight class in terms of insulation uh
but it's like super light very wearable we wanted to do a women's fit version of it this is not going to fit me very well because it's like fitted um but whatever you'll get the point so this is a medium but it's going to be a little small on me cuz it's more of like a women's medium so it's like fitted in on the sides and stuff um we just could not make the business case for it so this is a one of one prototype medium 3D down jacket uh we'll have that how much should we put on the buy now for uh well
I mean the 3D down jacket's like 150 bucks I think or is 250 I can't remember put it at retail I think that's uh I think that's pretty good ret fantastic yeah just uh put it at retail for the men's and then this this is a very unique item um the the story here is pretty interesting uh the code name for this during development which has been cancelled was Lux hoodie um it uses this kind of uh gold styled YKK zipper uh it's got a cute little LTT pin here at the back um but that's
not what makes it special what makes it special is uh does it actually have the development tag on it no it doesn't so I forget the actual mixture but what makes it special oh is it this tag oh there it is I missed it yes perfect is the nope it's not on here but whatever basically it has a um some percentage of cashmere in the uh in the inner lining so it's incredibly soft uh this was actually intended to be an internal only item uh was meant to be kind of Staff only but we had some serious problems getting
the fit right so you're going to see it fits kind of weird it's like medium length arms so you got to be a stocky boy who's not you Elijah you can't have it it's for the um so you got to be kind of a stocky stocky boy who has kind of kind of short arms like a like a medium size for your arms L of start to interrupt we got about 30 seconds left on this Corsair 6500 X RGB showcase build we're at 6350 can to make it 64 uh I think 6400 I think they can make it to "6,400 in the last 10 seconds now anyway"
for this one 10 seconds this very bespoke garment you guys have kind of seen the fit on me yeah we should auction that we should auction that okay we can auction 3 seconds 2 seconds I have no clue what the value would be so wow okay the computer has been purchased we're going to make sure the sale goes through come on it was at cool let's just put it on the buy it now for the same price yeah we'll we'll get to that we're going to contact them in a minute and hopefully sort it out all
right okay let's do the alien wear auction now then oh we're doing the alien we now y all right let's do the alien wear I got a couple merch oh yeah if you yeah yeah sorry chew I totally forgot about merch messages hit me uh favorite Mexican food oh well that's got to be the burrito sure yeah man Mucho Burrito one that's like the size of a small child oh but what about a chimy chonga chimy chonga is good but I love me a burrito lots of veggies get all those sauces in there get that
Rice some people put lettuce in the G yeah czy that's not my thing um the burrito bowl by all means put lettuce in it but man I I need that I need those beans and that Rice heavy you know I want it to weigh something yeah exact yeah exactly okay what else you got he needs to make sure that can taste the  office my desk is right next to that better update child sized burrito I don't want to provide an ETA for a release for the Precision driver but I I think we're targeting this quarter um
things are going well the I showed the case earlier on the stream uh the first first run uh off of the actual production molds looks really good for the actual case uh the driver itself I believe we have our order in for final uh final bomb drivers so theoretically soon soon yeah I don't want to promise anything though sorry Andy I got you all mixed up in your in your cables there should we put this next um did we do the Alienware bundle already it went through but the uh purchase is pending again it was
about $5 500ish I don't remember the exact amount we're going to contact and if it doesn't go through we'll put it on buy it now so then it's just this and whatever the mysterious thing in my hand is I think it is so it's the casm hoodie lonus just went over it yes oh I love The Bling dude well and we've got the Asus Pro noctua themed build back up on "buy it now for 4,800 oh wow okay yep so" one of our builds didn't go through properly earlier so we've got that on buy it now if you guys want to check it
out anyway just bear in mind the fit of this if you plan to wear it is a little unique okay it's kind of a it's kind of a thick fit he GNA roll but the arms are not but the arms are not super long so in the zombie apocalypse you know if you have long arms you're going to have bare sleeves and your your dead flesh is going to maybe rot faster there but it'll be comfy a one of one you said this was a one of one prototype it's too scary okay any who um so we've got this up it's up right now up right now it's
up right now 30 seconds already almost at $600 it's past 600 oh wow okay oh 650 and you're never gonna make one of these again ever uh I'm I I never say never  did 10 seconds over five but less than 10 rounds of trying to get trying to nail the fit on this and um the fabric was really challenging to work with and it's once we once we encountered this we were like well nothing else would be Lux to us ever again uh so 5 Seconds we were either going to do this or we were going to do nothing so
we settled on nothing 928 can we break a th000 for this one of one cashmere failed hoodie it's not a failed hoodie oh forgot I never even showed them the gold oh yeah look at those LT 5 Seconds pulls  goes oh man "$2,263 coup and we're sold" $108 to Crystal fire all right I think that's their third payment has now processed let's go congratulations okay uh can I put this with you for safekeeping thank you so much okay is this the last piece believe this is the last item we're going to be
auctioning there is still some stuff on the buy it now though okay so you guys are probably wondering the carabin or zipper pulls for the backpack what took so long the  everything um what we had explored at one point was rather than doing does anyone have the the one the final ones the new yes on my bag the new zipper pulls I have the old ones okay hey look we can show the whole Evolution yeah Alex if you could bring over the OG ones okay so you guys may know if you've
purchased a backpack you'll have gotten a notification or if you watch the WAN show um you might have seen this but our oral zipper pulls have a bit of a design flaw uh some of them are better than others but the manufacturing tolerances of this piece right here are such that if they're thinner than normal it's very easy for this to break off um that's kind of a drag because then it's not really a functioning Carabiner is it because it doesn't have a spring and and closing mechanism anymore so we explored
the idea of building a buffer version of this and realized well man these are already gigant antic zipper poles it would feel ridiculous to have a bulkier version of this hanging off of every one of your stupid zippers so we started to explore a one piece zipper pull made out of a much more expensive material so these are made out of titanium and they've got this really cool um I don't know what to call this pattern but basically spring well yeah I mean I guess but so it's a Cool Spring but
basically it's cut into from both sides alternating and because it's titanium you can bend it out of shape like of course you can you know it's you can but because it's titanium you can bend it back don't do that it will eventually stress the metal and it will break but it is much much more durable than the original now of course because we were working on our Luxe backpack at the time and because we just love doing things um hard mode uh one of the ideas that we explored was
these heat treated are these heat treated I believe these ones are heat treated I think it's a combo of heat treated and anodized okay we were exploring different suppliers and a bunch of different finishes but what you've got here is a lot uh let's count them here come come have a look at this Andy uh you've got a lot of a combination of heat treated and anodized titanium W those are pretty um uh Carabiner poles they're in an earlier design where we just had kind of like a ribbing here and we were hoping
that the spring here would be enough they actually compared to the final ones are less functional because if you look here they're kind of too thick so they kind of stick off um I would recommend this for someone who's kind of DIY enough to shave them down or something if you planed to actually use them uh these are more I would say of a of a collector's item little piece of LTT lore they have LTT um laser engraved on the sides of at least some of them it looks like all of
them and there's a variety of different colors and finishes you'll probably have anywhere you'll probably have two matching ones of pretty much anything but they don't match match because this was you know very early uh in the development of this product we we had wanted to see this through to completion but it just wasn't possible for a variety of reasons so we're going to auction it off let's auction them all we start it right now 45 seconds uh it's said invalid product we'll
wait give me one second here overall while we're waiting we can still go over some of the sales numbers shiny this will probably bring us over "$75,000 on whatnot so what Matt you said" that we're at 92591 right now including Linus's double up including Linus's double so we're nearly there these bids are ridiculous look how fast it's going I haven't been watching the bidding process some of them go up like again like these are one of one right you're not going to make any more of these we do not plan to
continue to explore these anodizing options so the fact that this says anodizing test means they probably are all anodization I thought we were doing heat treating at some point you know I don't know point is that's what they are they look like that uh wow 561 dang 5 seconds left can we 600 bucks for these how many do you get three like 20 handful yeah oh no 20 bus more I don't remember how many it was it's something I don't think it's 20 it's like 600 bucks oh someone bit again come we want
we want him to sell that shirt don't we three two one and soul1 awward let's see it go through come on come on come on come on come on let's go it's processed okay so hold on no applause yet we're still a little short right I think so what's in buy it now can we Chuck some of it into an auction the pro art is on Buy It Now on all right well tell you what here's no here's my deal right so what what are we at let me get my calculator I want to break 100K and I'll do whatever it takes
"so we're at 75 339 plus 10,000 I" committed plus oh that's it that's it we're at 93 192 yeah um wait how's that right that can't be right converted your like the BC page was in Canadian right or is it in US good question want to say it's in Canadian I think it's in Canadian because it's a Canadian children children okay well I thought mine was in us so let's go with us for mine um okay so what's the can you convert just the  quick I believe also go to BC children right now
donate link is in the description Link's yeah Link's right there to donate l "already matched over 10 or $110,000 for" it BC is 8926 right now 8926 in US oops where's my backspace okay plus 8926 uh okay oh my goodness can I even compute um math expert to help uh no okay plus 8926 okay so we are at 94 265 by my calculations and then what's that system 48 uh 4800 is what that's sitting at right now Okay so we've got to find some stuff um pineapple no no hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on who who hold on
hold on a second we can find some stuff we can find some stuff let's find something good I got a microphone I'm standing in the stuff this pineapple wait what no no no no that has no that has no LTT my bikini story bikini Village okay get this get this out of here what do you think 750 bucks hold on we can we can do better than this Ste okay Sans drive my framework laptop you only get the shirt if they get to 100 100K daily driven framework laptop complete with complete

you can coordinate I'd like to sign it inside because that way it'll last so if you could just have whoever tears out the SSD um just have them bring it to me before they close it up and then I'll sign the inside um also I might have pinched the display cable at some point so maybe we'll coordinate with framework we'll make sure we get this thing in in working order like obviously it's going to be as much battle battle worn as it can be so all of the surfaces will be the same but if there's anything wrong
with the display cable for example we'll get that swapped out for you we'll make sure it's in good working order and then we'll get it off under the SSD slot just somewhere just just anywhere inside just so that it's it doesn't come off cuz otherwise it probably will so um you know what I'll give it to you on I'll give it to you on uh um let's say tomorrow or Friday okay uh okay I'll put this in my bag for now then uh where's my backpack can we get a total of what we have uh working working working he's
