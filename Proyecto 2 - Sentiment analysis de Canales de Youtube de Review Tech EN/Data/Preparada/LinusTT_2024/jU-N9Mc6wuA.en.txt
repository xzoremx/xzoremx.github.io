building your first PC from Parts can be frustrating but with our videos it should be easy even if you're a total Noob at least that's the theory to Benchmark the quality of our teaching we've assembled a dream team made up of the only people shorter than me at the company oh my God alamad and Maria ladies have either of you built a computer before no that's a bit of a problem because you are going to be racing against me to see who can build a gaming rig the fastest wait what did
they not tell you no they know nothing oh that's great hey but we don't know anything about this don't worry you guys are going to be on a team against me and you can watch any YouTube videos you want as long as they're from LT and you guys are going to get some lifelines you'll get some extra help I on the other hand will be given a more challenging build but this looks the same actually oh does it Hardline water cooling okay like this okay segue to our sponsor that's bad MSI if you're msing a
new motherboard the mpg z790 carbon Wi-Fi 2 is a great option with features like a pre-installed IO shield and Wi-Fi 7 compatibility there's no reason you shouldn't pick one up at the link below that's a thumbs down link below each team will be equipped with our wits these tools including the gorgeous retro Edition LTD screwdriver LTD store.com and two hour 2 hours at the end our builds will be judged with penalties and bonuses depending on our speed and the quality of our work games master David
will explain all of that as we go Maria Alum feeling confident yes kind of as long as we can see a video of someone of you Buc some I'm just someone now before we start can we go lower we start short on the short end of the stick really this seems like a pretty good height really can we seems fine uh line is you're almost our height okay yeah that's better oh my god oh why is it going down oh it's still going down oh my God stop what's going on is this okay hype for you guys no you
good come on I never get to be the one making the short jokes three 2 one go oh my God okay where should we watch the you here yeah yeah yeah uh you can bring that laptop with you over here if you want under normal circumstances in one of these competitions I would fool around a little bit but I have been burned time and time again doing that so instead I'm going to get things going our builds today are based on our standard workstations for a few reasons one we already had multiples of these
components kicking around the office so that's uh convenient two these parts were picked for easy assembly in the first place and three it means that when we're done we can just deploy these systems to our team convenient how would you rate your technical ability out of 10 eight mhm eight depends on where where you but I mean yeah it comes to sewing machines yeah I could be like a you know 8 10 do you think that computers and  no for our CPU we've gone with the core i5 13600 K it's got 14 cores and it's
just generally good bang for the buck also unlike its roed out I9 cousins it is pretty darn power efficient don't oh Mary don't stop you're going to want to keep going I feel like we're going to take forever yeah I mean we chose the easiest gaming PC build video and L said here it was so hard to screw it up so hopefully we're good am I allowed to help them of course I mean if you want to lose yeah are you guys into POV content this one is really easy to follow along with okay perfect it's a
little bit less modern but this one's really good and then if there's any details you want to use how to build a PC the last guide you'll ever need I should have just let them struggle but I I can't I want I want a healthy competition okay for our SSD we've gone with the crucial P5 plus we like these because they're cheap we don't put any data on our workstations it's actually against company policy everything is supposed to be on a redundant and back up server but they have a 5year warranty
and have proven to be very reliable in our deployments I need to tell you guys about the lifelines you get so you get a medium help which is me coming there and I'll I'll be able to instruct you but I can't touch anything for 2 minutes okay uh and then you're also going to get a video call with someone much more knowledgeable than me Jordan you'll get another 2 minutes with him you have to match it with the dot at the corner of the socket but I don't see there's no dot wait wait wait wait wait  should
be for our Ram we've gone with some "Trident Z5 DDR 56,000 C 30 not the" tightest but it's definitely sufficient for office use okay CPU installed I think I gave lonus every possible out on Hardline water cooling making it simpler but he assured me he could do this in two hours I don't know if there's any orientation can we ask David maybe David David you want to use your Lifeline we have two with you right you have two  minutes okay David we need your help five seconds um this there's an
orientation for the r like yeah so if what I would do is I would line it up and see where the notch in the ram lines up with the notch here um L you want to use slots two and four right furthest away from the am I being asked for Tech tips right now that's that's what you do here's a tech tip open up the box and find your manual a for our motherboards we're using the Asus perart z790 Creator which is very much unnecessary Overkill we've talked about this on W show but Asus
insisted on sending some sick gear over if it meant that they could watch lonus lose what do you mean watch line is lose I'm not losing it's got 10 gig ethernet Wi-Fi 6E dual Thunderbolt four ports PCI Gen 5 and four m.2 slots lonus do you think that the LTT video library is enough of an edge for a new time Builder oh yeah you can easily build a PC with the LTT video library that's the purpose of how to build a PC the last guide  video okay there you go okay did they just get the RAM installed one of them
they're moving a little faster than I'd like right now water even yeah this one is high oh no sometimes it's good to rotate things around so so you can see from another angle hey that's for both that's that's an advice for both teams uh-huh they didn't even hear you I got to respect it I got to respect okay now it should be fine yay okay woo let's go okay thank you oh I think you just need to rotate this those are for different ones so I tested I don't have nails you have more Nails I okay uh where
I yay okay we're making progress you know in some ways I'd actually rather do custom water cooling than an AO cooler these days cuz of all the hookups and everything and all the RGB and all that stuff can be such a nightmare I've notice that you're not using the manual we use it for a little bit but then we prefer to use at least me I prefer to use the video because I'm more visual yeah I win good teacher down there oh that you will need that I took it off the table cuz lonus isn't using that
he's got something way more complicated okay so this is the cooling for the CP know you have to what does it say lonus has you all custom water cooling so he's got EK Parts including a velocity 2 water cooling block we're going to be using the noctua NH u14s on this side which is our standard one comes with 140 mil fan how does it make you feel when you watch your boss in a video weird I think this is the first  like yeah yeah but it's good I mean watch you explain really good life thank
you before I move on to water cooling my GPU I want to address a comment that I've seen a lot of times and it's that building computers is easy it's just Legos for adults um number one it's Lego not Legos the plural is Lego and number two I just think that's really unfair there's nothing wrong with the fact that they're taking their time looking things up going slow and when you're experienced you don't think about all that extra overhead that's involved in building a PC I am functionally done
I've mounted my cooler even though I haven't hooked all the water tubes up to it and as soon as I put this GPU in and plug this in I have finished building this PC that doesn't mean that they're doing anything wrong I can't help but you that's not quite correct oh no what's not correct you want all of them on the other one yeah okay on number two let's make sure it everything is in  um no but that's the wrong one I have no idea hey we should watch this oh so we need to rotate it uh if
you guys are looking for nocta cooler instructions uhhuh I believe you can look at the short we did recently mounting one of their coolers from 15 years ago or whatever it was it be the same it's the exact same mounting mechanism all these years later it's been about 43 minutes since we started and uh both teams are making progress are we really making progress oh no way thank you Corsair it's pre-added dang it Corsair you're making it too easy you were missing something yes you
you you've already picked the right ones but they should go on before  mean oh this this ones there you go and now should be able to did you guys get the cooler removed yet for this have you have you guys done this part yet no what is that oh gee uhoh where is that from are you trying  us okay so we are good because the cooler will be facing this way so lus says like what injecting I don't know why it's this funny but hearing them talk about L is says do this and do that
I'm like stand here I do say nothing oh my God I'm scared okay good well they don't have anything in the case yet we need your help 2 minutes of your help minutes of my time yes we're supposed to put something here before put in this yes okay so where's no no no sorry that goes directly into it if you look into that there's like it'll screw right into it in this position right yeah that's the only way it'll go right now yeah and then we need to screw those I was given multiple options for a pump
reservoir combo this might be a little easier to mount but I'm not sure if there's enough room or at least it would have been if anyone had checked to see if this case has any 140 mm fan mounts oh done oh done oh done just do wait this is cool EK includes a little sticker that's a hole guide now so you can just take this peel it slap it onto wherever you want it and you're good to go how is he going over there that is a radiator have to get some how are you doing over here oh
terrible I've never I've never built a computer before either so this is huh I'm doing good you already have like the motherboard and everything St we oh my God okay hopefully the water cooling goes wrong and then we have time for you know ouch wow Maria somehow manages to make even Trash Talk sound pretty nice you know I mean hopefully you hopefully you screw up everything and die okay that looks good I think I think we have to connect this also do I have fans for my rad I thought the case came with fans
ah but it does not it does not we're going on a field trip let's go oh they restocked the snacks yes Che got granola bars get some gamer fuel Y how many fans in it hey there we go classic LTT Edition 120  not David we did a cooler yay you're making progress yay Hey where's the excitement for me making progress  Yayo wow you know I just thought you guys were nice  easier o that's a demerit hey my camera op Knocked Up Glenn hit that I didn't hit that yeah Glenn loses points yeah Glenn you lose points
no it doesn't go in I will need a different radiator I'm giving the games master a de Merit for sabotaging my build it fit in the case that I originally tested with but we changed cases because Asus was so generous to  here so we need to align that and that's going to yeah there you go have one perfect hey you never have to look far at lonus Media Group to find water cooling crap oh  mm here do  Jordan hi Jordan how are you good how's it going there we're struggling that
looks pretty good what else do you have to put in here uh we have the GPU on the power supply here you should be good to put in the motherboard and then uh I would do probably the power supply next and get everything wired up and then do the GPU last okay bye Jordan steal all of light tools so we can't finish oh  yeah de Merit David I'm going to end this video with the the longest time somehow me I found screws okay this GPU doesn't fit in this case are you kidding  it I don't need to close my side panel
there no I I won't judge you on that okay demerits for the game master uh uh no one needs to close their side panels  panels okay grab the CES of the power  cheat I mean I guess I could just bend I was planning to just use 90° fittings for all of my bends it's a bit of a hack but I think it still counts as hard line especially when you're time constrained  them yes CPU this one got all my fans lined up and I realized this was just a be radiator there's no mounting hard is this not there
no oh my God it helps it all I'm having a great time too why do you choose to put the fans on top of the radiator fans go on top of the radiator for easier maintenance down the line also these are orange and I didn't want to see them in there this is the side of the power supply I'm use the CPU fan header for the pump it's far more important that your pump is running than that your fans are spinning in that that'll kill your system a lot faster experienced that firstand a little while ago uh they have
the names here of the things we have to connect so CPU should be somewhere around and then the other one is the PC I don't see them we're missing things yes you have 45 seconds my help okay where should we connect the PCI and the CPU connectors PCI is for the graphics card but this graphics card won't use this it'll have a specific 16 pin one I will attempt one freehand Bend if this doesn't go flawlessly then I will not attempt another and I'm just going to go  hot push it okay a David this is not fitting 
then you're you're not wrong okay  go yeah kind of ugly but it'll do right now the problem is this is too thick to fit under here and so in order to get this inside normally you could kind of like Jiggle It in kind of make it work but I actually don't think we have enough clearance to make that work L we might need your help I might not be good enough for this what do you need can you make this fit watch the master in action I thought so oh wow I thought so thank you w wo whoa whoa whoa whoa
what do you mean thank you I thought so you have to do it no well what I'm going to just hand them the W they're almost done true this is the last thing once you figure it out yay nice high five nice nice nice nice nice how's the water cooling going lannis extra demoralizing doing Hardline tubing in a case where the thing isn't even going to fit together when you're done it's just extra air flow because I need so much air flow in my water cooled computer are you going to keep are you
going to keep bending or are you going to fit it uh you know what the bending was pretty fast and I think it's going to be faster for this one too how do you find the screwdriver while you're building the computer for the tiny screws here inside like this tubby yes perfect it's good if I'm going to lose I might as well at least sell a few screwdrivers thanks ladies it is that one but flip it yeah yep I didn't help man love Hardline to me I love my build taking triple the amount of time for all
that performance benefit you ready for a high-risk maneuver we're going to fail let's fail in an exciting and   who needs a guide when you have a KN holy I think we got the angle how are you finding those little connectors I can't find a lot of things like because they have names on the connectors and we try to match those spel right now mhm the only thing that says panel here is this side but I don't think that matches there so like the real question is if we need to use all all of them are or not
um probably do but why is not working five more minutes no no no no no I'm going to use a little tiny piece of tubing as a bridge okay I think that was the right one yeah okay I don't know fingers crossed who knows if it works or not we have good chances of winning this what do you think I don't think so PL there okay there's a red light I don't know if that's working you're missing one very important cable which important cable the one that uh connects the front power button here we go freehand
90 oh that's my ugliest one yet it's on right I mean it's not the fun is not on I think we're past the two hours but neither team is finished do we go till someone finished dishes yeah all right I'm going to be first let's go I'm just going to help you at this point thank you let's plug in a monitor see if we're getting display out I'll need a monitor too what do you think Glenn how's it look Dandy huh tastes like  okay just got  please all right okay now we're cooking
let's give the CPU a receipt here shall we there's bent pins in my socket at least three what but it worked I didn't bend them on the way out and I can do a board swap in like 4 minutes if I have it I'll be back all right let's go technically they're not done yet okay I can still win this I think the best learnable today is that PC Building it's a team exercise everybody works together the curve ball it's  working oh my God hey I posted too I don't see in Windows they got to figure
that out still we do we have a video for that I don't know guess figur it out still got to get my GPU back in got to get my Loop filled they've just got to get out of the BIOS that's lucky it's actually the same bios we still got this  this okay okay so what did you what did you two do there walk walk the camera through what you did oh my God F1 hey woo okay everyone's Fortune's turning around this thing's coming together those I need to hit numl let's go when you can't keep giving them hints come on
David okay y good job we made it oh my God yes I am putting in cable ties right now if you're not going to finish on time you got to go for those bonus points okay 1 minute   plating wait shoot did I reboot    1 what was our total time just over 3 hours and 20 minutes but I'm very impressed and proud of both teams a thank you thank you do note uh Mr judge that my uh CPU and GPU temperatures are in the top right of the screen wow okay that's we don't know we don't know people can't do
that I have to say the fact that you were able to Hardline this computer this is a good-look system yeah it is goodlook so the front looks real good and that's the most important part but let's go take a look at the back oh you don't even have the side panel on it's so much cleaner yeah I would that was okay uh I'm a little bit disappointed by the  ties yeah there is there's some on the front yeah there's two okay that's pretty nice we don't have that we need to win don't say that yeah I mean it's
not perfect but for a rush job this is this is a darn nice system L unfortunately due to technical difficulties I had to step in and help the first impression is it's not quite as clean uh Cable Management leaves a little bit to be desired uh though you had cable ties I brought those specifically they don't need cable management they need cable one  management wow I've really had to struggle for that it's not as bad as lonus is because there's just not as many cables but yeah why is this going
over that's what you did WOW before we go any further I realized we never even talked about this GPU I talked about every other component and then Asus sent over these gpus because we needed matching gpus for this uh they're 480s they're super quiet they have gigantic coolers on them uh they're really fast I actually have something that David missed this computer unfortunately is a fire hazard ladies your high voltage pcie power connector is not in all the way however any points I might have
taken off for that if I was judging which I'm not I would have given back for using my trademarked little uh Ty pretzel in the CPU fan cable trick I like it I like it good job this is really hard I I think you got to give it to [Laughter] us I feel really bad doing this but I think I am going to award the victory to lonus your what all by myself this beautiful t-shirt wow did you make this shirt all by you know what I would have given it to them really to be perfectly honest with
you yeah we don't know if I broke the motherboard that's true there's also a lot of water in my computer you didn't look that closely okay put it on we should put it on together what do you think how do you put it you guys are doing great yeah this is so wrong yeah yeah now smile oh wait wait wait oh God oh my goodness so all right well this devolved um extremely quickly you guys did great GG there you go and GG to our sponsor Squarespace are you looking to create a website but lack the technical
