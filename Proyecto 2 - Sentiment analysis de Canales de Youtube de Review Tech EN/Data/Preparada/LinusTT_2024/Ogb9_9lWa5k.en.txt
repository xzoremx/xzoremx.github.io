and we're live we are celebrating 16  channel and 16 million subscribers and we're doing it the best way we know how by building computers with some generous help from our sponsor Jawa and from many of your favorite Hardware manufacturers we are building 16 gaming PCs that we're going to sell on Jaa for an amazing price of just "$1,600 each and we will be donating the" profits to charity we're also going to be looking back at 16 years of memories testing my recollection with some
pricing challenges oh no and we're going to do it all in Just 4 hours oh my God we barely started and we're already like an hour behind actually um okay what am I supposed to be doing next ah yes when in doubt segue to our sponsor Jaa is the number one gaming Marketplace to buy and sell gaming gear and get awesome custom PCS at the best prices with Black Black Friday just days away what better time to buy a new custom gaming computer than now on java. jaa's PC finder can help you find the perfect
PC with just a few quick questions about how you game and how much you want to spend and you don't even have to give them your email everything we're about to build should be already live on Java so all you got to do is check out the links in the description it is Continental us only sorry rest of world including my fellow Canadian Patriots um also the buyer may need to pay duties but hey we're doing our best with it we're going to tell you a little more about Java a little later but first we
have got some work to do we've got to get to building and I think the building that I'm supposed to get to is over here with my co-host Riley welcome lonus to my build to my build station that's my we've got two different base builds one is AMD one is Intel we're going to be building eight of each of two at a time we'll talk about each part at some point during the afternoon but maybe not during every single build the exact gpus are going to be the one thing that varies Jawa sent over a dozen gpus for
us and Jordan over there is going to be interrupting us with some memories from each of our 16 years as a channel as we go so without further Ado why don't we get started um which one do you want to do I I don't know it's been a long time since I actually built a PC I don't know if I've I did build some at LT but I was going to say since NCIX but no it's been are these custom stickers that's so cool double sweet 16 are we putting them on the computers that is so cool too 32 stream cuz it's double
sweet just um thank you what are we supposed to say what the components are are we just doing it we're just going we could just do it if you want have half an hour half hour I have half an hour until I pH out of existence we have half an hour well 28 minutes now well I do well is he going to build a new pc every half hour he's going every half hour whyus you better hurry up uh yeah I'm going to actually have to go pretty quick no pressure on me okay well hey while I get the
motherboard and CPU and stuff built up why don't we do your first uh your first little memory thing Jordan all righty well let's talk about uh first memory from our first year which was November 2008 to 2009 uh what video do you think got the most views in that time 2008 to 2009 yep brother I probably couldn't I probably couldn't tell you a single video that we uploaded in 2008 to 2009 okay all right well let's get no no no I'm gonna try right no I'm gonna try I'm gonna say it was an
unboxing which is I know a very bold guess given that uh pretty much everything we uploaded on the channel was unboxings at that time it was just all unboxings I'm going to say it was an unboxing and is the question which one got the most views during that time frame or which during that year during oh during the first year of LTC existence during the first  oh boy okay we could have Dan threw up the thumbnail maybe that'll give you a clue no no no no no no I don't need the
thumbnail I don't need any hints was the firet truck that year no no no it was not in the first year I'm going to say it was an unboxing oh I'm torn I'm torn okay I'm going to let Riley caty do you think it was I'm going to let Riley pick okay do you think it was a motherboard or a case in 2008 to 2009 yes big year for for working in the PC indust big one and I remember like it was yesterday you were a Mac guy you have no idea what was going on in the PC space I was a guy I
was a Mac guy at that time I was still rocking my Core 2 Duo white MacBook that I got for University nice okay but I installed wine on it okay I was kind of a dork that's pretty cool okay cool did you install wine or did you spill wine on it huh little bit of both I'm I'm in seconde University sitting at home swilling burning the midnight wine oil studying yes economics uh is that what you studied no I was just trying to think of something that you might study in University right
got it what did what did you study in University I'm I actually don't know the answer I got a uh psychology degree how's that working out for you great I've learned so much about you oh you know what that's kind of fun I said in the uh what it's like to work did I don't know if you did you watch it no I'm not allowed oh right well I'll tell you just this part once the company I I told myself that once the company was shut down and or none of those people worked here anymore then I would
allow myself to watch it so I'll tell you just this one if I retire I'm allowed to watch it I did say that I have a psychology degree and that's sort of a joke because it's not actually true I'm like I could talk for hours about linus' psychological profile or something to that degree okay could you talk for nope not right now is that like is it like an ethical thing like you're like you're not allowed to no of course it's doctor patient confidentiality so like we could we could do a session we
could do a session we could we could do a session right now I'm sure the people you still haven't guessed What the freaking well you still haven't told me what category it's motherboards motherboards you're you were stalling okay I'm going to go with Rampage 2 extreme motherboard unboxing not even close not not well okay are you even the real lonus I got a camera right here okay oh he's got a camera this big thing right here is called a camera okay look In fairness to me hold
on a second In fairness to me this place is chalk covered in cameras how am I supposed to know which camera is pointed at anybody I mean Dan doesn't even have a camera pointed at him so Dan are you just are you just flipping between all the things are you're moving all over the place oh is this the one oh he's  here he's got he's got the video up on the screen get out of here guy that sounds like an old timey what are you doing here man come on oh man uh okay all right so not even
close not even close Okay well I saw it's a GPU yep man maybe this will help you it's "got uh 25,000 views in that year" "25,000 views it's actually had more" views this month that it did in the  out wow what was even what was even the hotness back then what if I break something here this is do I take this off don't do that no no don't don't take it off you just leave it like that you can just kind of slide so they did a little bit of pre-building for us but in some ways
it's actually complicating the situation because it prevents the uh the hold down on the ilm from actually like um coming all the way up so you'll just have to kind of hold this here the CPU in there and then it's been it's been so long that I've built a PC that I the last time I built a ryzen PC it had the the pins were the opposite way yeah yeah it was um not LGA the other one PGA is yeah yeah you didn't give it the old no I that's right though right PGA yeah yeah what the what the I'm all about
tech news now I'm all about just talking about platforms and Google and antitrust uh yeah it's land grd away gr grd away man I am I am off today I have I have now tripped over my own tongue like four times already on the stream land Golf Association land AR as opposed to the much more difficult seag golf or pin grid array those are those are the two options man these are nice machines for "1,600 bucks we're going to get into a" little bit more detail later but we've got 7800x 3D processors it looks like
we've got uh 32 gigs of ddr5 memory uh all the gpus are going to be a little bit all over the place but the point is that at retail these would be costing hundreds of dollars more and because of the generosity of our partners Who provided the vast majority of the parts for them here's your RAM Riley oh thank you yeah we just kind of randomly move the parts around because of the generosity of our partners Who provided all these parts uh when we donate the profits from them
it's not going to be like you know 10% or whatever like it would normally be when you're building a computer it's going to be darn near the entire amount of the computer because most of these parts were sent over for this charity build stream which is pretty exciting for me and when we talk about profits from the computers that were crypto mining right what oh man I think it is it's been a while look I'm building PCS it's taking me back like am I at ncx right now that would be funny if it was
like a year ago but we are we are fny we are headed into another crypto boom so I have no idea what GPU pricing is going to look like I well I oh I should probably just because I don't say it is not going to change the reality we actually have a video coming on the main Channel very soon um main Channel you know who whoa whoa whoa uh we have a video coming on the main Channel really soon asking and trying to answer the question is now a good time to build a PC and there's a lot of factors to
consider like on the one hand you've got um according to the rumors nvidia's 50 series coming but on the other hand according to the rumors and also you know nvidia's pattern of behavior Intel oh sorry no you go you go you go you go I have so many thoughts 50 Series isn't going to be cheap uh and also that could be exacerbated by the incoming us administration's plans to put some serious tariffs on basically all Goods coming from well pretty much anywhere um I've caught up to you by the
way you've caught up to me I thought you were ahead the whole time no no that won't be the case sorry okay so sorry you had some thoughts on whether now's a good time to buy a PC well no I just thought you you mentioned nvidia's uh cards coming up mhm just maybe allegedly maybe we don't know anything uh that's what the rumors have been pointing to if we did we wouldn't tell you and this week there were also rumors about Intel's gpus I did see those rumors yeah I did see those rumors
does this feel like a make or break moment for Intel's GPU division jeez Louise like if battl Mage does not absolutely crush it and movees some serious numbers are they just going to pack the whole thing up yeah well I mean I thought that they were packing the thing up already like cuz there were previous rumors talking about how they were like okay we're not really going to focus on discret gpus like in the investor calls and stuff yeah that wasn't even just a rumor that was the
CEO directly just saying we're not really going to focus on it yeah yeah how do I what is this oh this whole thing comes out that's a that's a big yikes if you're working on discrete gpus at Intel now to be clear I'm not saying they're going to they're going to stop developing gpus anytime soon now that we've seen battle mage integrated into what has been a I mean by Intel's recent standards yeah what successful launch yeah the integrated gpus on lunar Lake are part of what makes those processors a
compelling option against amd's own um so I don't think that Intel's you know GPU architecture unit is going to go anywhere but it does seem kind of unlikely if if these battle mage discreet gpus don't absolutely crush it it seems kind of unlikely that we're going to see many more of them in the future but we'll have to see yeah I mean the one that was leaked so there was an Amazon listing leak for the oh I missed this yeah this was just this week just uh on the weekend actually The Arc b580
so like the not the top one that they do which was the a770 yeah uh or the a750 50 yeah 580 so this is the b580 the successor to like their lowest one I think it was the one of the lowest oh that's mine yeah I know but I already put my box away can I have your thermal coup please I'm just about to use it fine while you're waiting how about that video you can't remember oh yeah right should try and I guess that  2009 this is post 8800 GTS this is pre98 is this 8800 GT you know what how much
do you use is that is that too much I'm going to say it's an EVGA 9800 GT is that too a little bit more no all right fine can you just all right I'll put you out of your misery yeah put me put out of my misery show show me the show me the video Dan's got the thumbnail there okay where's the thumbnail on his live screen there oh H there's a computer screen in between me and that screen computer screen a computer uh Tower hang on a second we'll fix that it's not a screen it's quite
quite opaque and oh it's an XFX y so that would be an 9800 GTX 5870 587 had they already made the switch to radon only I'm not sure but no kidding you're a fake te Tech Tipper yep even I knew that I totally forgot when XFX made the decision I wonder all these years later if they regret that move or not because the the old school among you will remember that like EVGA and BFG XFX was actually Nvidia exclusive before they went AMD exclusive they are to my knowledge the One exclusive Nvidia
board partner who has ever just gone completely the other way and gone AMD or or well like radon exclusive I think gainward may have been Nidia exclusive at some point don't quote me on that one um in fact don't anybody quote me on anything because I'm going to I'm going to get my cheat sheet or as I call them lat the cat the chat I'm going to bring that I'm going to bring the chat up and see if you guys can remember anything that I'm forgetting here uh here we go first time
float planner love the show okay great I don't think that's working we've had some internet issues today which is why the stream started an hour behind schedule oh man this is this is really taxing my my brain here it's been a while really I I don't I don't do this anymore yeah I stopped kind of makes sense I stopped writing LTT videos CU I really wanted to make Tech longers and you let me to my surprise yeah how are uh how are those doing are those doing the analytics for those lately oh I mean
they just take too long ah okay well I mean it is right in the name but we'll have to see take longers take longers I think that was that joke was it was made a number of times has that made have I made that joke before yes I believe so oh okay I don't remember making that joke I thought it was fresh I think everyone made it we all made it we were having a great time together sorry Riley no it was good I think I have my I think I have my chat working now oh I should pause these because I'm Tethered
to my phone right now do I need to go all the way with oh yeah yours are tight uh yes you go all the way until it bottoms out I'm just trying to be like you lus so I have a quick question for you Jordan yes sir no not I'm implying anything about my current co-host or anything of that nature um but uh but how much help am I expecting to have like completing these PCS like do most of the I'm helping you right now you really are um do most of the co-hosts sh know how to build computers or am I am I
going to be I I know how to build computers I care about quality over quantity okay take longers right there you have a mix of a veteran and somewhat less veteran help got it um just so that we can sort of gear me up and prepare me for what's going to be happening today who's my most veteran co-build geez lonus don't say Riley don't say Riley I'm honestly I'm honestly probably on the upper level side right I'll I'll give it to Jake Jake okay so Jake's my most veteran Builder he's a pretty
veteran Builder Jake's okay I mean he's a he's a young man but he's definitely built his fair share of computers okay  please say Riley please say Riley not Riley not Riley okay okay I used to i' I've built I mean this is why it's so funny because I I feel like I've built particularly at NC I built a crap ton of PCS oh yeah 100% it's between a couple of people we'll find out later I feel like close to a 100 over the years yeah I I just pulled that completely out of my but you were the
main like techy guy I was the guy at NCIS you know at a certain time yeah Chris was there yep um and other people actually you know what I'm going to say did I do this wrong no no because one of them's Well normally you would have I shouldn't say normally often these days you'll have a CPU fan header and then you'll have like a CPU opt or like a secondary CPU fan header but in on this motherboard you've got a CPU fan header you've got a pump fan which Often by default is configured to run it 100%
uh and and then you've also got a system fan header up here so because I want I just stabbed my finger it's not bleeding I don't have to fill out the form um nobody saw it um so be I just did it again wow that RGB header is really sharp we're using this as evidence I just stabbed two of my fingers we're off to a really good show them the wound um you did it for charity Linus yeah yeah yeah yeah they they take they take food bank right I put my fan on the wrong way buy a system with lest blood
in it no that's fine what yeah no that's fine it's going to go this it's going to go this we want to go that way don't we no it's not it's going to go this way you're good what don't worry Riley you're doing a great job you your instincts Oh no you're right have kicked in your PC building muscle double cheing things before you get too far in has taken over and then you yeah you build the entire thing and you realize you have to disassemble the entire thing because one thing went wrong yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah but nothing went wrong you're doing great honestly you're a little slow I mean the fact that I'm can you just hey he's got 11 minutes left he's got tons of time yeah 11 we've got 11 minutes to finish this the PC is basically built and Ian we have to stay on schedule today like we don't really have a choice because um other hosts are are coming in they're they're coming in hot Riley they're coming in yep and but well you know but like I'm stressed I want to do go as far
as I can but at the same time I'm not what I'm not going to get in trouble if I don't finish this or wait yeah I don't think you do are there Stakes I don't think yeah hey Jordan are there any Stakes like if people don't finish does that person just get a crappier unfinished PC like is that the idea like do we get Stakes at the end who who brought who brought out this antistatic strap came with the uh the pad it came with the pad oh it came with the modmat that were're hey are we ever
launching this thing do you know can you do you want to send a quick message over to Nick I have no internet when we oh talk to him later right the internet problems it's been guys it has been an actual Adventure today zomer says line is quick question how many screwdrivers  problems well legitimate question though I mean I'm sure that every Tech problem could be solved with some amount of screwdrivers you just have to get creative yeah I mean you need thermal paste like there's metal in screwdrivers
if you grind it up fine enough you could kind of put it in there mix it in with a little bit of peanut butter or like toothpaste or something I think you could make that work as pretty bad de advice um well look if people wanted good Tech advice then they can go watch toasty Bros okay this is we're an entertainment Channel purely an entertainment Channel I get I get such a I get such a kick out of that right because uh I get about for I think for every LT is just entertainment for every
one of those messages that I see I get a message or an email in my inbox or I have an interaction with someone in person that's like Dude LT kick started me on my it career and I'm like a system admin now or I just finished my uh I just finished my degree in compai or whatever else I think that people I think that people underestimate how hard our writing team you know people like Jordan work to make sure that the content yes is entertaining because that matters I mean think back to your
teachers right if you had an entertaining teacher in school were you like oh yeah but it's like just entertainment no the best ones will entertain you while also teaching you something do we get absolutely everything right and are we absolutely perfect and do we go into the greatest depth on every subject no that's what you go to Tech link for subscribe today yeah subscribe to TechLink that's that's where you'll get the deepest the deepest depth the deepest yeah analysis
expert all right but but we do go out of our way to bury to bury knowledge nuggets you know in between all of our in between all of our cars okay and mansions okay we also want to deliver on knowledge knowledge is he still culturally relevant I don't know but I made that same reference the other day and I was like I don't maybe this isn't a good idea like like on the show or like in person you know what I like more than Tech tips knowledge knowledge I don't think he has a New
York accent but I did it for a second okay Riley let's have some fun or at least I'm going to have fun do what no I'm going to have fun I don't know if you're going to have fun but I'm going to have fun you put that in wait I want you to do don't I put can you do some accents for me like how many accents can you do you know what it's a bit of a dance let's have let's have fun uh Andrew Andrew can you for a second you know what let's have fun yeah let's have fun I've decided today we're going to
have fun I can I borrow you Andrew we have fun here can you go stand next don't do no not with Andrew no okay Riley can you do your no no Riley has an Irish accent I couldn't I couldn't possibly there's no way don't don't make me do it lonus I won't but no no it doesn't matter what I think it matters what you think I'm very insulted right now well cuz I don't know I I you did reveal what area of Ireland you're from I've revealed it yeah yeah but I I I I have one Irish accent I don't know like
the different you know so you don't somewhere in the middle I have one Irish accent you don't even have that I'm sorry I'm so sorry to put you both on the spot I'm not actually sorry I actually found that really funny but uh I'm not even sorry about little it I  why don't we uh shout out our first uh donor company here on oh let's do that let's shout out our first donor company um okay uh uh Jordan do you want to do that because I don't actually know who they are it's right on the screen here
for you oh it's right on the screen uh Kingston there you go Kingston sent over eight of their what are they nv3 nv3 two terabyte of their two terabyte yep Kingston sent over uh 16 eight they sent over eight of their two terabyte ssds for these machines um that is all completely free of charge which means that when we go and we donate the profits from these machines to oh boy this is uh this is kind of scary when we go to donate the profits of these machines to charity uh the entire value
of those ssds will be part of that donation now my understanding is that we have not actually settled on an exact charity is that is that correct uh we're looking at uh probably a local food bank but the exact one is not sh certain yet you know what seems like uh seems like a good time a good time to donate to the local food bank what with things being challenging and this being a particularly uh challenging time of year so hopefully we can get that process pretty quickly and uh help make a few
people's Christmas a little bit more merry is that mag the plan for now uh is which magnetic this little doohickey here Corsair you know what it really looks like it is Corsair link it is the least of my concerns right now I'm figure out why my motherboard's not going in you guys have 5 minutes left my good oh come on oh you know what we got another memory we got to get to as well uh okay so uh Dan do you have any merch messages we're kind of runting some casual Black Friday sales on LTT
store are there any people are any people picking up merch messages yeah there's quite a few coming in all right hit me Dan sure I love the magnetic Cable Management idea but it's a little on the expensive side have you ran into any competition with this product has anyone tried to copy or undercut you to your customers uh that's a really good question so the thing about our magnetic cable management is that a majority of the cost is in the neodymium magnets uh so neodymium is you know a commodity
material which means that the price is the price sort of no matter where you are or who you are or uh what currency you buy in or sell in um and so in terms of undercutting right you could try to undercut us on the neodymium by just taking less margin but I can tell you that um you know if you're an Amazon Marketplace seller for instance you're probably going to be spending about what our margin is on that product just on Amazon listing and selling fees so you're not going to be competing with us
on Amazon um and if you're sort of you know running your own Marketplace or whatever else then um you're probably going to want to make some margin so you're probably going to be priced similarly to us because the reality of it is is once you are once you're working with injection molding Plastics are functionally very little cost um and the same for the little plates that we have for them that so you can attach them to like you know wood surfaces or or whatever else like those are those
are literally pennies the vast majority of the cost is in the neodymium so because neodymium costs what it costs um it's going to be pretty hard to Undercover us without um significantly harming the quality what makes the magnetic Cable Management products work so well is that the magnets are super super strong and uh they they hold stuff really really well and so if you were to have a competing product that's the same as LTT magnetic cable management but with less magnet in it then you would
just have a worse product so will someone make a worse product at a lower price probably but I don't really have any interest in competing in that space if they want to do that I think that's chill um and I yeah I'm not into it no I'm not really worried oh the round ones oh Riley is Riley listen for crying out loud Riley is Charity it's a yeah that's a you're going to you're going to Dent the glass panel Dent it two minute warning you could Dent It 2 minutes jeez you know I
was actually feeling pretty good cuz I was pretty close to you we like we got our case out at the same time and the I had my mother I mean you were talking the whole time what else is new you know you know what I mean like geez wow wow Riley thank you for that what a guy but now I'm just wait way behind I just like geez don't worry Riley I think that you are doing absolutely what are you doing oh jeez Rick what I I got to put the screws in the oh yeah in the motherboard
oh yeah yeah no that's great that's good is that's where the screws go in there right they do I think they go well they don't go in the motherboard they go in the case um through a hole in the motherboard you know so they so the so it's attached like a motherboard should be yeah right that's what you usually do uh Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message I am I'm not going to lie I'm getting I'm getting a little stressed out here because even I who build a lot of computers like now oh I didn't put the
shield in have you didn't put the ey always at least I checked at least I checked yeah now was a better time to check then after you had put in all of the uh all the screws all the motherboard screws you're getting stressed because why um because even I who build computers on a fairly regular basis still um not exactly finishing these in half an hour um we're going to have to try and who can can like I feel like that's like the fastest people can do half an hour I mean I'm sure some of
the builders at NC could do that no in the I love in the I love building computer stream where I was actually trying to build them as fast as possible I think I got down to about eight or nine minutes I want to say no what 17 17 is that 176 Oh I thought I thought it was lower than that oh my goodness so I'm actually going to have to haul butt in order to make this happen you know what I can do it though we're so we're are we going to Time Each one we going to Time Each one yep you're moving over
here now no no I got to finish we got a set a baseline no no we got uh guys coming in to finish for you I know but I got to set a baseline at least for my machine don't worry I'm going to make it up in the next one I'm going to make it up to the next one Mark you want to start on that one oh hi Mark yeah you can have a head start Mark all right go for it uh I'll be over there at a minute you just give me well maybe a slightly more than a minute oh man so Jordan did I really start at the half hour mark on
this you started at the half hour mark okay if I can finish this one in 35 minutes minutes uhhuh right then if I can finish the next one in 25 minutes I'll be caught up after just two PCS and then if I could finish the next one in 23 minutes I'll be 2 minutes ahead which would be incredible and if I could finish the next one in 19 minutes then I would be slightly more ahead you are one minute behind already Jordan Jordan Jordan Jordan Jordan look look look Jordan I sir sir sir this sir this is a
Wendy's not even supposed to be building PCS yeah but PC wasn't built in a day okay supposed to be building Junior braking cheeseburgers a we're not sponsored by Wendy's don't what um oh is it jbc's is the acronym in case you're Wonder that's what you're trying to think about right no that's not what I'm trying to think about at all I'm actually really scared right now because I feel like you and I may have up a bunch of our stuff no and because these are systems that are going
to actual people who are going to actually use them at some point actually you know wait I didn't think about that but I I've done a good job um they might need to have all of their accessories included with them and and what not you didn't no we didn't cross-pollinate our our deals here are you sure yeah what do you mean how how is that possible I mean you took some of my thermal pce so whoever gets the cooler is going to you know get a little cheated there I can't believe
we have a team for that it's okay uh no no we got this we got this I've got this you know what I've got this totally under control and I am no longer stressed at all because of math I did the math earlier and if I can build each computer two minutes faster than the last one I'll be ahead by the time we're done that's why I'm not stressed oh my goodness this case just tripped me out I went to lift it up and there was no there was no anything there it's starting Hallucination is starting Oh no
you're an AI Linus this isn't real if I was an AI I would probably uh probably be building this faster right now okay probably I think I'm in I think I'm in pretty good shape here right now I'm mostly um certainly looks like I couldn't help wondering what these fans are for just in case just in case now they're just in the case  father that's content puns like those that's cont okay uh J hey Jordan which GPU is me whichever you like whichever I like those are both from java I can have
whatever I like please please I'm going to take the one with the bigger cooler let's go like it a little faster what what a little faster leg it a little faster he's like stressing about getting the build's built on time but he's also stopping to dance and do a little yeah you're 4 minutes over now and I'm uh and I'm more done than Riley so you also four minutes behind the next one too dude this guy this guy's a Mac guy you think I'm not going to catch up to Mark in like the first two minutes look at
him he's got a manual out for how to   don't if you're slower than Lions you don't get to have any cake okay so C I'm I'm off now right yeah I think you're off I need a handicap what no no I'm still going to finish mine regardless Mark what yeah you're good Riley huh you're good so our skilled team of procurement professionals are finishing up any PCs that don't get finished you're going or is it Reese Reese okay mix of logistics and procurement you know you know the people who do the real
work skilled regardless who aren't just pretty faces they're also pretty faces everyone's a pretty face okay I'm just gonna leave this yeah perfect I'm not gonna do any more damage I mean it's you can PR pretty much ship it like this I it's a it's a concept PC Riley this could to you could totally take this to computex and just be like oh we have a bold New Vision you it transforms into a caterpillar you can kind of see where you were going I think I think that's really good great work Riley all right
uh all right wow that makes me feel so great patronize him like that I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to put a side panel on this bad boy and I'm going to figure out how it's Oriental mated and then do do I have to post them is that when the stopwatch stops okay well the stopwatch never stops so you know everybody see you later Riley thanks for dropping in happy happy birthday me it's a weird thing to bring up when someone's leaving happy 32 years uh uh Dan stall them hit
me with a merch message yeah sure sure sure sure hi less what do you think is the next big Tech change you're excited for I'm hoping for a drastic leap in Battery tech sometime soon man doesn't Battery Technology feel almost like uh like carbon Nano tubes at this point I wish Riley was here so we could talk about so we could talk about carbon Nano tubes you know where it's tubes what hey he's back he's back he wants to talk about car I'm sure Mark knows about carbon nanot tubes
machines yeah it feels like carbon Nano tubes you know where every other week we're hearing about some huge advancement that's going to absolutely revolutionize the entire world and week after week it just stays mostly relevant to the lab and uh and not really not really applicable to the real world um to be clear I'm really excited about you know solid state batteries and some of the headlines are extremely promising like you got companies that claim they're putting them in cars right now
and the range is awesome and it's incredible um I just want to touch it you know I want to see it uh I do think that better Battery Technology will change everything like oh man this is this is something that drove me crazy when I had this realization I pulled my old iPhone 6 out of my nightstand drawer because I wanted an iPhone with a headphone jack I wanted to like listen to headphones on my iPhone and I couldn't find my uh my USBC adapter um don't ask why it doesn't matter the
point is I pulled it out and I was like wow this is really thin like that's really cool man they've gotten they've gotten chunky you know if Apple could put a if Apple could put that same capacity battery in a in a slim form factor again you know they would because they're apple and it's kind of what they do uh Hey were we expecting there to be an HDMI cable um on this monitor by any chance I suspect this is posted and I'm going to I'm going to call this one down I think you're good I'm calling that
time so uh you're seven and a half over okay you know what not bad I am about to just absolutely clown on this Noob wait where's my PC H where the heck is my stuff oh it's oh it's way up there mark you're taking up the whole you're taking up the whole table here brother I mean what's the what hey look look I got AI Ram that's that that that's probably A1 AMD system one I assume right not not AI I'm going to go with that it's AMD system one uh okay Jordan yeah buddy what am I supposed to be doing this is
we're on year two now for those of you joining us a little bit late this is our double sweet 16 we we're on year three we missed year two we missed year two you were kind of slow so I skipped it what no we have to do year two all right year two okay year two well hold on I got to update the people I got to update the people and I got to get I get got to get Mark's tower out of my way apparently I'm supposed to supposed to do everything around here I'm supposed to compete with like a tiny sliver of
table over here um so we're doing a double sweet 16 stream where we're celebrating 16 years as a channel and also 16 million subscribers by Building 16 PCS in the most chaotic way possible for charity where is my motherboard how did it how did my motherboard end up I have no idea how that were you stashing my stuff to slow me down no it was in my way did you guys see him where's where's chat chat's GNA chat's going to out you did he do that they didn't see it he was C off camera wag you yum yum I saw
nothing I saw nothing nothing happened stop gaslighting your employ that's right go I don't believe liting isn't real I did nothing wrong I don't believe you I don't believe you and I especially don't believe any of you I am quite certain that I would have I would have realized if my computer was supposed to be like that uh okay okay year two okay year two let's do this thing all right year two so November 2009 to 2010 you were a wee "baby and uh this video got 110 ,000" 
views 2000 2009 2010 yeah so mostly 2010 cuz it's November to November man see you guys don't understand the you guys don't understand the pressure I'm under trying to answer  because we unbox random stuff back then like I would I would unbox a portable hard drive you know I I would unbox a a a coupon code for a game that was coming with like a like a bundle you know when you buy a a GPU or CPU motherboard bundle or something right like I I have no idea which videos performed
well I know which ones have performed well in the long term I might be able to take some stabs at that but he wants me to tell you which ones performed well  let's just say I'm going to oh no no no I don't want any hints I don't want any hints I don't need them I don't I don't need the hints all right you're try to buy more time that's all I am not trying to buy anything I'm trying to sell these amazing PCS that we're building at java. G okay and all the profits are going to
charity that's what I'm trying to do today and how dare you how dare you how dare you question my motives today Mr Jordan block yep to say to say to me that I might be stalling for time never why I find  be I find it to be unconscionable to say that I might be stalling for time he Mark you want to hit him for me I'm are you are you taking my stuff again you know that I've already installed that CPU right you have effectively hidden nothing you have achieved exactly nothing and also I saw you do
it I saw you do it this time you will have absolutely no one on your side now I'm going to go check I'm going to check right now while I unbox this fan because I can multi did you just take all of his Ram you guys all saw that I saw nothing I saw nothing no no you saw saw everything he actually did it he actually he put the ram a different place what no it's in his computer where'd he put the ra Mark Mark you only get one kit of ram there's four Ram slots yeah there's four
Ram slots but this is AMD so two of the  decorative if you want to run them at uh if you want to run them at an optimal speed you don't use them at least my CPU is inde decorative uh my CPU is not decorative my CPU is right here oh I was making an Intel joke so how about that year two video Dang Dang now hold on hold on hold on  on this we don't need light because Mark casts all the shade all by himself this is also I think I've created a serious problem for myself oh no it turned back on on its own oh good
the power button up there which if you guys have followed any of dbrands marketing you'll know that I'm 4 foot one and can't reach it room okay here what is what does it say on there andy oh that's right that one's I amver short.com yeah I remember now oh boy okay well I am in a flow now and what you guys may have noticed is that even though I'm still behind mark I have 15 minutes to complete this PC which I have made excellent progress on and this time around I have pulled out all the
things that I need ahead of time whoops toles oh like wires and thermal paste and IO Shields and all that stuff I bet he doesn't even have his IO shield look at him he does now Mark you were going to build a NZ a little while ago what is the last what is the last PC that you built the last PC that I built yeah did you end up building that Naz oh yeah yeah what kind of what kind of machine did you go for AMD oh okay uh it's uh  ago and it works no one saw that right had the plastic bottom on the
bottom of my cooler who needs verify for you h no no you don't need you don't need to see you don't you don't need to see any of that uh now what do you what use your Nas for are you still super into like VHS capture is that like a side hustle still or like yeah I learned all about the uh beams Day project duplicated oh okay you're going to have to tell me about it because I have to confess that while I find the topic interesting I haven't dedicated nearly the amount of time that you have
to like old analog video capture so uh tell me about the Doomsday project so well uh so I got my whole analog capture set up posted on uh X and uh they told me or somebody DMD me and was like hey there's this better thing that like can capture your footage at like the original uh right potato yeah but like way better in terms of like instead of going through your RCA output okay yeah oh like you can pull the internal tape quality like kind of like with like consoles where you can like pull the
original quality right off the chip instead of taking it to like the uh the RCA output on the console or whatever like there's an internal right there's like an RF test point that you can tap into and uh get more detail which is amazing uh I'm not good with soldering so Dan Mr Dan helped me out with that yeah that was a lot of fun yeah um it was pretty interesting I have never seen you know like the snow on the VH yes oh yeah I have never seen it perfectly Pixel Perfect like all of the squares
like you can see the brushes going over the well the heads going over the tape cuz it's it's all magnetic in incredible yeah I was uh I was floored okay that's pretty cool is this a new thing yeah like 2018 really and it was used originally for laser disc and the cool thing is because it's all magnets yeah it's all magnetic you can uh basically do it with anything that has an t so very cool even if they don't haven't decoded the actual signal it exists so this is the end game
once you capture it like this there is absolutely no point in continuing to hold onto your original media in hopes that a better capture method could come along or anything basically but I've heard that this is the end game multiple times in my life so right uh we'll see I'm I'm I'm very impressed with it though oh that's pretty cool yeah and so is that something that people like come to you for often or is it mostly a hobby or like uh right now it's mostly a hobby but uh we'll see we'll see maybe I
uh can make a little side hustle out of it I mean we did that video a little while ago if you guys remember uh we did that video on capturing one of my old VHS tapes and um Mark was brought in as sort of a an outside well an inside consultant because the truth is he's probably forgotten more about analog capture than I ever knew like I always found it I always found it interesting like my first real GPU was actually one of those Allin Wonder ones that had the the TV tuner on it because
I loved the idea of being able to get video into into the PC like if you can if you can take video out of the PC surely you know you should be able to get video into the PC but as it turns out video capture and encoding  magic yeah half black magic and half half science um well it's it's all science I know all science I know but black magic yeah yeah yeah black magic design yeah yeah you know a company that makes capture I'm more of an Aja guy myself which is fair which is fair and valid I'm just that's
based that's just not a joke it's not funny yeah no I know I mean mine wasn't funny either but uh minutes how many minutes 11 11 minutes no problem no problem brother because because I couldn't help noticing a little thing I couldn't help noticing a little thing here remember remember how I told Mark I was like he he probably doesn't even have his IO Shield remember how I said that guess what he doesn't have in his  now that's two two for two who needs an  Shield nobody needs an you do what do
you need it for what does it do he actually pulled it out and showed it to me and then forgot to put it in it's the most common it's the most common Mac guy PC Building error wow wow wow I've seen Lots these days that have it just built in yeah yeah also I still don't know what it's for uh grounding dust grounding I actually think it's more to do with RF Dan oh that would make sense I think it's to make the uh it's to make the entire chassis enclosed and you know safe or whatever so the
reality of it is it doesn't you're not still putting in screws are wait what screwdriver you using what is going on over here nobody give me a screwdriver I'm what are you you taking out the motherboard or you leaving it in oh my what's happening how many have we done um we've got some great Black Friday deals running on LTT store so if you wanted to leave a merch message now is as good a time as any we've got free shipping around the world I think it's on orders over $300 is that right I've got so many
merch messages I have no idea probably okay cool well go to LTD store and buy stuff I have to put this in beforehand oh yeah buddy oh man oh yeah buddy so uh I have in uh what what am I at like 12 minutes here closed the Gap and pulled into the lead not that it's a competition not that it's a competition cuz like I said it it was never going to be a competi it was never going to be a competition well it's not really trash talk when it's like over you you know I didn't have a
screwdriver I mean for the first little bit I mean that sounds like a skill issue to me buy yeah it's not like you work a place where uh yeah this is a pretty good screwdriver screwdrivers run like milk and honey I'm a video editor we don't edit videos with screwdrivers I mean if you did I'd be pretty impressed well that would make for a fun short yeah I should I should pitch that to Arty like okay here Arty hear me out for a for a spot for LTT store we uh we have one of the video editors Ed it
with a screwdriver LTT like uh Edward scissors hands but we just like like zap strap a bunch of screwdrivers to all their fingers I'm into it screwdriver hands um shoot I actually missed something on my last machine I didn't plug in this front USB two header I didn't see it so uh I I'll I'll penalize myself I'll give myself a small uh 30- second penalty so so Jordan you're keeping track of my times right sure where the devil is my front audio connector on this case are these all the
same case yep okay so all the first eight are so whoever's job does this go here arrange hold on miss my front panel audio yes sir does this go in here or does it go in here yeah yeah it goes in here it goes in here yeah okay it's funny how many things I kind of take for granted as an old school Builder that um that people who didn't really build back in the day I built back in the day won't know well or may have forgotten I rebuilt my G5 Power Mac okay that doesn't count
yeah that that doesn't really count oh here it is cry out loud okay why don't we uh shout out a couple of more donors for us yeah let's shout out one of our donors okay so uh massive shout out to noctua who contributed 16 of their these are NHD 15s hey yeah yeah 16 of their nhd15 chromax black coolers you can check these out here these are a great cooler for cooling well basically anything and uh that means that when we are donating the profits of these machines which we are
selling at uh java. when we're donating the profits the entire value of those coolers gets to be donated rather than contributing to our costs so thank you very much nocta we were actually blown away by the generosity of our partners when we told them what we were doing um we ended up man I I think we ended up getting almost everything comped by someone they were all extremely excited to help contribute to this and it's just uh it's heartwarming especially this time of year so massive shout out to
noctua and then I think I've got another one yep I also want to shout out gskill who sent over eight of their flare X5 memory kits these are a perfect pairing for our AMD systems they are ddr5 6000 and the exact uh CL rating I'm going to guess 30 because G skill gskill ain't no fool yeah there you go so they're DDR 56000 cl30 32 gig kits they sent over eight of these to make sure that our systems would have enough memory and enough highp speed memory that you're going to be playing the latest games
let's go uh what else we got here that's five minute warning uh five minute warning huh I don't even need five more minutes to finish this PC you wouldn't even believe how fast I'm going to finish this one yeah let's take B on that it's going to be so fast fast it's going to be so fast look at this I'm plugging in my front panel headers and everything Dan just to show how confident I am yeah hit me with a merch message I'm going to build the rest of this PC in 5 minutes while also replying
to merch messages wow easy hey dll uh it's just DL and M now what is the worst computer parts company my personal pick has to be HP oh see I could get behind I could get behind the HP pick if we consider a printer a computer parts because I am not a fan of some of the incredibly anti-consumer things that they pull with respect to their printers however if I have to narrow it down to computer parts HP does have that case but I wouldn't really I wouldn't really classify them as a computer parts
company I would say they're more of finished goods company so if I've got to pick a computer parts company am I allowed to pick ones that don't exist anymore is that an option because some of them uh don't exist for  ocz Dan you spoiled the answer oh sorry I actually have a personal Vendetta about them uh I guess that's unrelated you and everyone has a personal Vendetta against ocz OC OC was the one that I was going to pick to give you some idea of how Shady this company was they marketed they
marketed a product that used um what they called utt dieses um and these these UT memory dieses the way that uh the way that ocz marketed them was that compared to the really desirable dies at the time uh so things like in the lower capacity DDR days like wind Bond bh5 or later on you had uh Samsung tcds for instance uh the way that they marketed these UT dieses was that man they were flipping fast all you had to do was pump enormous amounts of voltage through them and you could get them to go like like
wicked fast um and like don't worry we got your back if anything goes wrong we'll like we'll get you a new one so UT was short for was code for untested so basically instead of actually binning them and making sure that they could run at the speed that they were selling them at they just marketed like as a as a as a bullet point like on the product page that these were untested dyes and you could just juice the snot out of them and they would cover it under warranty and uh that was that was their
product and you know what oh yeah sorry what's that I have a fun story about ocz do you yeah I bought one does it involve an agility SSD uh yeah uh I bought one because you recommended me one on nzx Tech tips years ago okay so In fairness to me agility ssds were a crazy good value and I have a theory that they were using similarly unvalidated nand flash but that was not something that was that was I don't know if that was ever actually confirmed but it sort of came out later
that that may have been the case so I did not I did not know uh did your um did your agility SSD live by any chance no not for very long not for very long no the funny thing about that is that some of them did great I mean that's the thing about you know random you untested Hardware hey speaking of that ocz doesn't exist anymore but there's some very ocz like practices that are going on in the dram industry right now particularly ddr4 so there's two competing lowcost approaches to ddr4 memory which is still
relevant because you still got am4 out there using ddr4 you've still got LGA 1700 older gen Intel CPUs that are using ddr4 um and also some of the some of the the nonwestern um CPU platforms are using ddr4 as well and there's this like there's this competition between the folks that are taking harvested dyes off of like old memory modules and remanufacturing them into new modules so these would be like South Korean dies and the the Chinese Fabs that are building brand new DDR for
at super super cut rate prices um I wasn't going anywhere with this I just thought it was really interesting also it's time for me to install my GPU I've got an XFX Speedster 7800 XT so this is the same class of GPU that we put in those last two systems over there and basically it's going to mean that you're going to be getting a fantastic 1440p gaming experience out of this thing uh and in slightly older titles you could even drive these systems at 4K so these are really nice little systems uh 7800x
3D this was sent over by Jawa by the way who is our sponsor for the stream and who is the one who is handling selling all of these machines for charity for us just going to go ahead minute over your time yeah but remember last time I was like eight minutes over time and I am just about done I already got my dpu in who when did when did he get all when did he get all caught FR P that's pretty impressive yeah but he doesn't have have his eight pin power connector Wi-Fi well
you know yeah yeah is the io shield in properly it's in wow really I even I even got the uh the little Wi-Fi antennas in it's amazing what having an actual screwdriver will do for you no kidding do you have your Wi-Fi antennas in my Wi-Fi antenna is in I don't need those I use wired ethernet like a chat you know got them roasted well you don't have a power supply though do you not have a power supply Mark well hand yeah the hand is very what's in the box this is even with him trying to
sabotage me look the cables were inside the case I didn't know that see unlike mark my my completed PC here is actually um actually completed okay we're going to do a quick post test do I have an HDMI cable yet to demonstrate my confidence that I have made up ground here I'm going to go ahead and put my side panel on which I know is bad jues but I am extremely confident there you go look at that what a gorgeous little machine HDMI oh here you go Jordan oh wait uh okay yeah so do I have uh do I
have a power cable here did we did we think of that yep it's here oh okay it's uh okay so not here it's over there that's fine that's fine that's close enough and Mark you put you put all your stuff are is the plan to put these on yeah oh cool do I get to pick where it goes yeah or maybe that's your priz if you get and done on time all right I'm putting this excuse me no I'm putting it on Dan do you want to hit me with a merch  sure there's a peel yeah yeah yeah no I know the Peel's there I'm just I'm I'm
eyeballing it I'm eyeballing it plastic on plastic I'm thinking right here right here okay hit me down hello to ask what would be the one Tech tip that seems obvious but surprises you the most with how many times it slides under the radar CPU you know what I think the one for me has to be um buying secondhand gear even though we talk about it all the time even though it's like it's something everyone's probably heard at some point it amazes me how often I see people buy something brand new for reasons that
um just for reasons that I cannot that I cannot understand there are times when buying brand new makes a ton of sense but I would say that for most people unless your budget is quite High uh there are at least some parts that you should at least explore getting something secondhand um it does take more work and maybe part of it is just me being in my my hobbyist mindset and being like well what what like deal hunting isn't like the best part of building a new pc you just you just want
to go to a store and walk away with everything you need H what that's crazy right I I do think part of it is just me being sort of you know out of touch in that sense but it is it is probably the one that surp me the most how few people are open to picking up a used something and for reasons that just don't seem rational to me sometimes we did that recent video on uh picking up home theater equipment secondhand versus buying a brand new Soundbar and I saw this I saw this one
comment that was like I don't want like some like herpes AV receiver and speaker coming into my house it's probably dirty I'm just like bro you ain't got any like license All wipes left over from the pandemic you can't you can't you got you got no disinfectant that's it's fine chill brother it's okay so I think that's my I think that's my big one all right here we go oh oh we got any uh we got any lights hey there we go let's go also for bonus points I'm removing the peels from these there we
go you're five and a half behind no man you're doing okay I'm doing great better than okay and this thing's going to post you just watch she's got all her power things plugged in everything's going to be great I'm so confident Dan go ahead and hit me with the merch M hey let's go all right I'm on to my next system see you later Mark thanks for tuning in to the Sweet 16 stream thanks for playing good effort you're pretty good at building computers well thank you I mean you know has anyone ever told you the
thing today is I'm going to build them until I get good at it so uh he's getting better I'm getting better I'm improving all right so this time I've got 24 minutes and speaking of no competition what do you mean I am up against the one you just dropped my stuff why are you even using that stuff uhoh wait Dennis what are you doing I'm taking the plate off you are un you're currently unbuilding it how could I possibly lose against this guy oh wait you don't even have a mic yet what is
happening here is it your screws they're all over the I'm looking at the the the the instruction they're all over the floor my goodness well I think I'm going to win okay so what was my Mark it's the competition no one told me is a competition yeah of course everything's a competition I thought you Head Start do you want Life's a competition Dennis that's all we do here Dennis no one tell me come come on let's go faster well that's not a very competitive mindset and I'm afraid you
might not win then what's the the the the paste thing there we go you don't need to worry about paste yet you need to get that CPU in the socket first all right right right I'll tell you what I'll tell and stop no no okay oh my goodness one sec one there is so much wrong here already okay so that's no just wait oh okay well here's the thing oh sorry there's a little prompt open on the thing I need to there we go here's the thing I can only guarantee that eight of the computers will work the eight that I
built uh uh Jordan what was my time for the second one by the way uh how much over were you the first time I I don't remember I thought that's why I have an official timekeeper got a lot of stuff going on over here okay maybe someone maybe someone in the chat maybe someone in the chat can help you out but I'm starting this one now okay you're 8 minutes behind so like 20 I no I was at more like 23 more like 23 behind what cuz I'm not behind Dennis I'll tell you that much he has been
unbuilding over here he took off he took off the CPU Cooler in Brackets and then I'm going to put it back on exactly he's trying to make it fair that's what I'm saying Dennis I'm saying you were unbuilding and then you're like no I'm not and then you proceed to tell me the thing you unbuilt well I haven't watched lotv a while I don't know how to do you're not missing much jeez I mean In fairness we don't really build computers very often anymore so exactly yeah you're not
really uh yeah you're not really missing watch the build streams we do a lot of these do we though I don't think we do that many of these it just feels like we do a lot of them cuz every time it's uhu I don't think we need this anymore all right I'm not do the the the the paste he's going to do the paste doesn't it come with paste I'll tell you what I'll I'll tell you what Dennis you've done enough paste in your life uh no wait no um tell you what Dennis why don't you move your RAM
first so you want that in the slots that but how do I put it on after if that's is that kind be on my way like in the way um right well no it's more just that you have one of them in the wrong slot oh yeah so you wanted in the second one from the well okay you took out both of them okay well only only one of them was in the wrong slot so you want it in this one right here right there yep there you go and then you also want it in the farthest one from the slot why those two are the
most electrically stable they have the best signal Integrity on most motherboards so who put in the first and third uh the first and third yeah oh my goodness we click these all in okay don't worry I'll help you Dennis um first and third would be if you're putting in four sticks and you don't mind if they run at a much lower speed did you okay hey how come they're not the same here I bet you watched this video um it's really complicated and it has to do with like uh like like the
signals effectively like like bouncing back and causing some kind of interference on it's it's I can understand it if I'm like reading it and I'm like oh yeah I get it but it's one of those things that I don't get well enough to remember it later and then explain uh well okay hey I bet you watched that uh that Taiwan computer video right the one where I built the machine in the yes I I skip  end sorry well at any rate wow yeah it is it is you know it's a really funny thing
it's a really funny thing to see the speculation that takes place online sometimes about um what an ogre I am and how my staff is obviously afraid of me and stuff they they could use a little more fear is is what is what I think I'll say about this guy um just anyway in that video one of the things that I critiqued about the build was that the Builder opted to use two lower capacity kits instead of one Higher capacity kit and the reason that I criticized that was that if you run
two kits they're stuck running at a  speed you're not really listening so "instead of running it like 6,000 or 6400" megat transfers per second it runs at like 5200 which doesn't make as big of a difference to this is just old numbers yeah well one number much bigger than the other number yes yes so it runs at lower number oh and slower Ram right could be bad right probably maybe might be fine but could be bad okay okay finish that video hit me with my guess with your what hit me with my my my my my guess
thing those are tuning in a little bit later this is our double sweet 16 stream we're having a lot of fun today to celebrate 16 years of LT and 16 million subscribers we are building 16 PCS for charity and when we build each pair of eight PCS Jordan is supposed to be giving me oh wait so you're supposed to do two years per PC oh yeah you're way behind oh okay well let's do a few then all right let I'm supposed he's supposed to tell me or he's supposed to have me guess or to number three now I'm on
number two still Dan yeah the the card thing okay yes yeah oh my gosh so put the thumbnail up don't listen to him which video from that year was our most viewed so 2009 to 2010 November to November yep here's your thumbnail oh I got a thumbnail now okay what's the thumbnail wait we already did that one it looks very similar well that you said that was number two Dennis yeah number two 2009 this one one is labeled as number two yeah that's right oh we're still doing it okay no I did that one no
no you you did number one I never finished it no no no there's they look very similar really yes another XFX GPU you are correct oh this was the uh HD 5770 really yeah that was the most feud in year two wow XFX gpus were like bangers for me back in the day apparently I didn't remember that at all uh so year three is a little more interesting okay all right hit me with the thumbnail for year three and yes Dennis that was a thumbnail back then okay because I don't even you want to
see a real thumbnail I don't think thumbnail was a think back then right did YouTube support that's a real thumbnail custom thumbnails yet I think they might have but it might have been a frame they must have was it a still frame from the video though yeah oh okay so it's not entirely my fault take on Reese can you L that down so we can see the screen so that one I remember no I already saw mind you're good you're good so that was a special edition EVGA GPU and I'm just going to have to try to
remember what it was I want to say I want to say it was a Oh God how did you take that a 560 TI you're pretty I want to say it was a 560 TI and it was a special Duke Nukem Forever Edition card because that was back before anyone knew what an absolute turd sandwich Duke Nukem Forever was going to be yeah was it a was it a 560 TI you're very close a darn it what was it it was a GTX 580 and the uh Matrix 3D Monitor and 3D Vision you were doing a giveaway apparently back then oh cool dude I wish
that I had archived all the giveaway entries for some of the contests that we did back in the day for LT some of them were so funny and the thing is you you you treat YouTube like it's going to be there forever it's not most of the really good ones are gone even if I could find the old spreadsheet you know on my NC you know email or like like sheets account or whatever even if I could find it most of them were pulled down over the years and I it's sad because some of them were so
creative and so funny there was this really cute one where they did like stop motion and they were like a monster or something and there was uh there was this there was this one with like really really bad acting and like uh like someone was attacking the city or something and like I don't know it was it was really cool and the community was smaller but it was hyper hyper engaged at that time it was a lot of fun it was a really fun time on YouTube oh my God all right let's do one more here okay
okay one more guessing game oh God you want to fire up number four there Dan okay what year is this this is uh 201 yep parad drone so this one had uh "820,000 views in the first year this I" think was the closest thing to like a viral hit that I had had up until that time uh I ended up doing multiple videos featuring the AR drone uh I did like a range test in the NC parking lot uh I did like a a weird jousting thing where we got two of them and Luke and I like tried to fly them at each other and have
them hit in midair uh tried to milk the heck out of the AR Dr but in the end nothing ever really came close to the  video all right time to get this thing in a case okay I need some help what can I do for you sir how how do you attach this thing uh you got these wire Clips you take that off to here uh no you you get more of them so you put them on just like this okay and everyone does it a little different you know some of them you hook it onto the inside one some of them you hook it onto the far one
whatever so it's better to just find one that's already done and just do it exactly the way that they already did it that's the safest way what do you think Jordan who's going to be the first of my co-hosts to actually finish their PC don't want finish uh it'll be the next one I finished not on time yet though who was Mark was the last person you had Mark and you've had uh who was first Riley did he finish Riley did not finish H In fairness to them half an hour he just need to finish doesn't need to work
right um I mean might have worked but sure it needs to work before we sell it people are actually buying these we selling this on Jaa yeah it might already be sold yeah wow yeah actually yeah can you tell has anyone has anyone bought any of the systems Jordan I'll see if I can find out I'm kind of curious now Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message we've got our Black Friday sale running on LTT store.com you guys can go check it out at LTT store.com we'll have more about that
later oh yeah okay do they get cheaper um if they buy the one I buing I know no there no discount I'm I'm not sure if they get to pick which one they get so okay they might just get it and you might just have to kind of do your best with it the one that's broken is janis's one should be pretty easy to tell it's not done yet uh We've sold five of the AMD builds wow it's I'm afraid to ask how the Intel builds are doing uh yeah okay cool one of those well In fairness to the builds we haven't actually built
any of those on stream yet so people have only seen the AMD builds merch message yeah hit me Dan sure what did you have the cable hold on wait for Dennis are you okay bud Dennis what did you put the cable I think you broke Dennis the cable's facing down right oh yeah yeah you want that you want the cable on that fan facing toward the bottom gives it a bit of a cleaner look yeah okay all right hit me Dan figure this is the best time to get an LT screwdriver do you feel like financing a PC is a good way to go
or is it better to wait until you can afford to pay full price man I'm going to call out so hard one of my elementary school friends you guys remember oh man what were they called was it MDG the the ones that had the the computer for a dollar a day yeah was that MDG I think so or was it someone else I uh I can't remember anymore but he bought a Pentium 3 PC uh for himself he he he bought it with his own money sort of because like me he was in grade six or seven or whatever and like me he
didn't have any money so um what he actually did was he got his parents to sign on for him to finance a computer and I will tell you the same thing that I told him back then that is like the dumbest ever don't do that they're still around offering those deals they are still doing it wow okay so the thing about technology is that it depreciates so fast that if there's an affordability issue you are far better off just waiting around for the affordability to reach your savings than
you are financing something because the interest is a Hiller now I would say it's actually less true today than it used to be um Electronics don't move nearly as fast as they used to back then like by the time he finished paying for that com that P3 he could have had a way faster P4 um for all the money that he spent can I help you are you I just C caring screws oh okay uh any um so I would say it's less true today now that the industry doesn't move quite as fast especially if you can get
a reasonable financing rate and if there's some reason for it like with the incoming tariffs uh we have a video coming soon that is sort of discussing is now like a time to urgently buy a PC in hopes of getting a better deal before uh computer hardware gets slapped with tariffs because it may very well be um but in general in general I am very opposed I'm very opposed to using financing to buy something that depreciates so quickly uh there okay there are other exceptions cuz you could look at a car
and you could you could kind of say the same thing like how could you possibly use financing to buy something that depreciates so quickly and I mean well for one thing no I don't I I did not buy any of my early cars uh with financing I I bought cheap crappy cars um for as little money as possible so I'm not a huge fan of that but there are reasons to to buy something if the if the money you can make from having it is greater than the cost of owning it even with financing then you can justify it that
way so if you need a car to get to a better job that pays you more then absolutely Finance Finance the car right like I'm not going to I'm not going to no one's going to give you a hard time for that I don't think so in the same way if you're using a PC to do work and you need to finance it in order to more effectively do that work that's such a such a totally different conversation than if you're like financing a gaming PC this day and age you straight up no under no circumstances should you be
financing a gaming PC because you can get a capable gaming PC that'll tide you over for like nothing like next to nothing um you'll pay more an interest on that financed computer than you would on this like on a on a PC that would absolutely be able to play games decently um while you wait to be able to afford something something something new and something nicer so I'm not a fan but if you're making money with your computer and you and you need like new capabilities that are simply not available on older
hardware and that's a totally different calculation and I'm a lot more on board is that all is that all kind of shine and Sparkle what do you think Dan we covered that enough yeah I would say so that a long answer I think it's the correct answer Dan I literally talk for question what did I say Dan Dennis yeah I'm Dan is this the wrong one it's so short I Can't Screw the this one in I have that problem too uh you haven't put your IO shield on we are three for three oh my God he did three for three
how six minutes remaining oh my God my God someone will have to buy this half Bill PC and build himself Dennis you have to take the motherboard out again Dennis you have to take it all apart yeah also why are you here why are I thought you had to put the motherboard laying down Why does every everybody keep taking the whole table you miss why I have no room to work I thought you supposed to put the PC down to BU to put the motherboard no well you can but do it over there everyone everyone takes up the
whole flipping table like I I have my stuff like down here on the floor because I have no room to work Den Dennis you have literally like 85% of this table dedicated to your stuff and you're over flowing onto the floor look at this Andy he's also taking up space  ridiculous uh okay Dan do you want to hit me with the merch message I suspect things are popping pretty hard on the store right now I wasn't expecting to be so busy yeah we've already done 200 I'm not exaggerating uh let's see
what do we have that's fun here when are we getting LTT sandals I'm sure we get this a lot he he only cared that to bother me I know I know he knows better is that a contentious issue I actually don't oh you didn't know okay so I would love to do an LTT sandal but the challenge is that in order to do a sandal you're not just doing one mold you have to do a left foot mold you have to do a right foot mold these are probably relatively complex molds right these are I mean if
you're going to have a couple different colors on the on the sole then you're you're going to have to have at least a couple stages so they're they're reasonably complex molds I don't um also you're going to need H let's see you I don't know what what what does it work out to like like how many sizes would you typically expect expect to find in a in a range of sandals like eight to 12 and all the half at least eight sizes so now I'm on the hook for 16 molds minimum um good number
then what else do I have to deal with oh yeah minimum order quantities in order to make that mold cost make any sense I'm stalking thousands and thousands and thousands of these sandals um so and that man that even assumes that like we don't know anything about making shoes so could we even would it even be comfortable would it even be any good it's just it's a huge gamble it's a huge bet um and for what I don't you know I think it's funny you know I i' would be the first person to
to be like you know yeah like yeah let's make a meme product I love it um like that's why we did the the strawberry underwear for example we did a strawberry colorway of our underwear um I love that stuff but this is like huh this is this is like a sixf fig joke at this point you know you start you start making sandals because like her lus loves socks and sandals right like that's not that's not responsible that's not responsible businessmap um whoever prepped this machine um may have overlooked
something I will figure it out though basically all of my 8 Pin connectors on my power supply are taken up and they shouldn't be so that's fine holy you're so fast it's getting faster you sound like my wife is going to the fan distribution yeah but it's um I can use a six pin for that ah I think unless those six pins are not well what couldn't tell you so the other builds that I've seen so far didn't have both 8 Pin power cables going up to the CPU and I think that may be why I have an Xtra here oh
okay yeah I don't think we have enough to do both yep that's the problem so I need to salvage one of those back and use it for um we're at uh 2 minutes by the way I just need to salvage one of those back and use it for nothing I'm just out of connectors on the power supply uh oh 2 minutes I got 2 minutes to fish hey did we get the final times for the first two what am I up against here I have no idea um how many have to do he has to do eight himself okay we got two hours left
I can build got another four this computer three or four this is number three okay problem it's got five to go dude no problem you're doing okay this is not a problem easy I mean it definitely isn't helping when I have to unbuild things but I got this so Jordan what are my times what are my times has anyone tabulated them I have no idea I'm not on the internet lus I can't do anything not on the internet we should have internet you might want to just it's not working for me it's still not
working we'll figure it out apparently I've got uh opened my phone and I have a thousand angry messages from Sean and Jake cuz somebody told me to plug something in and then I did that and I was absolutely not supposed to do that nice all right oh this is not easy sorry everyone at the company yeah well don't worry we got this we've been having some internet problems today so it's been an exciting day because I can tell you as a as a web video production company uh internet pretty important to our daily
operations yep cool so Jordan is sitting over there with no internet so what are you even what are you even doing Jordan I have my offine copies of all my information for the stream why do you still not have internet is that my fault I don't know I think it's probably my fault Supply I'll I'll blame Dan you see why we like Dennis what he lacks in knowledge and skill he makes up for an enthusiasm like look how hard he's trying I'm trying to pretend I know what I'm doing do you guys actually know what
does here now like Dennis started as a video editor and now he actually like I think you still open up a timeline once in a while for your I do yeah but he actually works uh for the business team now on sponsor spots so he does like creative what do we call them C CSP creative sponsor yeah production creative sponsor Productions so the idea is to make our sponsor spots so more watchable yeah so entertaining and engaging that people will actually go out of their way to watch them or at the
very least abandon the video a lot less during them and it's been successful so far right like you've been in this Ro for over a year on way show I mean every week on Wayne show that's the regular stuff and they're so good LT videos used to be on tickling and now mostly just on LT stuff got it some of them are pretty funny there's a vessie spot is that vessie spot with the like stolen sandals is that up already yeah that one's yeah that one's up in end of September okay that one
performed very well all right cool all right Jordan are we all caught up on those uh guess the Guess The Video things uh we're two years behind okay hit me with another then number six yeah yeah do we show the or no number five actually don't show this one don't show it no uh okay what year was it then this was 2012 2013 and you'll be shocked to learn it was an unboxing oh so hot 2012 2013 well that's got to be the fire truck yeah let's see okay how many views did that get in the
first year that was I think that was over a million some wow so I can tell the story behind that 1.1 million one of our other product managers um one of our Junior product managers was handling Arctic cooling right you know like freezer series coolers like like that silencer series coolers they had I think back for gpus back in the day so they were handling Arctic cooling uh what do we got here is this another 7800 XT should sure is all right sick let's put this bad boy in Java sent over six
of those guys so Arctic cooling decided that well hey like I mean if we can Source like coolers from China or wherever and we can throw our brand on those and and sell them or you know whatever like if we can if if we can handle the logistics of of sourcing and Merchandising and marketing and selling you know coolers then why not remote control vehicles and they uh so they released a a tugboat a tank and a fire Tru and as a favor the junior product manager was like hey look I brought in a bunch of these
stupid things they're not selling um can you help me deal with this can you make a video can you like help me get rid of these stupid things um and and as it turned out so I so I said okay and as it turned out they were actually pretty cool and even though the fire truck is the most famous One the tank and the boat actually both got a fair number of views so that ended up being uh that ended up working out for everyone I think we ultimately did manage to sell through them allall although it did
it did take a while just cuz like I don't know what it is even if you have a good price an okay product or whatever if it's not what people go to your shop for sometimes it can be hard to sell things like I remember ncx brought in like zoji rushi rice cookers and every time I talk about zoji rushi people who know are like oh yeah those are like the best rice cookers but we couldn't sell them to save our lives it was crazy uh so we had a heck of a Time selling those uh remote control vehicles
but we tried we did our we did our darnest are you done uh I don't know we're going to find out when I try and post this thing so what was my time for that one what was my time for that one am I am I making up time here you're like an entire computer behind is this supposed to be a price if we someone beat you I I mean sure I'd be down to I'd be down to do a PR a second from denn it's too late one okay here we go yeah wait he got to for a head start no he's about previous PC still yeah no I'm
so you have a head start right now if  building okay we'll get your mic in a sec yeah all right my fans are spinning my RGB is lit let's go card what are the odds what are the odds TR turning my on Dennis there's no point trying to turn yours on and nothing's plugged in you got you got nothing plugged in brother but uh oh that's not good that's not an  noise that was not good that was actually kind of bad I just mangled this cable it posted uh oh but the system works yep yay he
nice um wow that uh well it's a good thing it's a well it's a good thing it's a Snapdragon PC and I don't need to charge it very often all right hey computer's fixed okay oh boy I am going to we haven't had those which side am I on am I on this side am I am I just like yeah you're done you're you're done thank you whoever is buying this thanks for coming out you get to learn how to build a p at home what already has the knock with yeah you can't even barely open it what s all right hey Buddy Bud
for those of you just tuning in now we are doing our sweet double sweet 16 stream we're celebrating 16 years of LT we're celebrating 16 million subscribers and we're bringing in well eight eight members of our team to co-build PCS with me that we are going to be selling for  java. next Java read off the prompter there oh can I shout out one of the parts providers First sure um is this is that the next one yep you're on the right ones there okay so I wanted to shout out MSI who sent over eight
motherboards and eight ssds they sent over all of the b650 gaming plus Wi-Fi boards that we're using for our AMD builds thank you very much MSI thanks to them all of the cost of those boards will go directly to our charitable cause which I think um from our conversations so far is probably going to be a local food bank it just seems like the right time of year to be oh that sounds lovely yeah contributing to the food bank and "so that means $1,600 time 16 PES we're" going to be pitching over 20 grand uh
toward the local food bank which is pretty exciting assuming all of you fine folks buy these computers hey there's a 50% chance you'll get one that was built by me rather than one that was built by like Dennis or Mark yeah I don't know if I would want those ones uh so far those have not been going great um but well this is just going to be boring then how can I make this Terri no no where's the shot color don't say don't talk about those we don't need we don't need the shot color what about two
I mean need is one thing want well that's a different word uh anyway I also wanted to shout out Corsair who sent over eight cases so all of the AMD PC cases were provided by Corsair we ended up paying for almost nothing out of this stuff which is super cool um yeah and our sponsor Jawa sent over all the G use so that's why those are mismatched because you know Jawa a right they're used they're Marketplace yeah very cool to in this case on your last builds here these two gpus are from colorful uh
Jordan I uh that's no longer on so if I was supposed to do a Jaa read off the then it uh let's uh make that go on it ain't happening sir wa we're supposed to be racing right I mean yeah we can raise I mean are we at the same point like kind of oh there's already an SSD in there this is this is so cheaty yeah everything was already done for me look it's not meant to be like the hardest possible PC build it's just meant to be like a like a friendly PC Building Challenge like friendly but like I want
to destroy you kind of thing right why you got to be like that Jake well I'm not even trying that hard you're just going so slow I figure I have to go slow to like stay on your level you know some of us are hting a video okay Dan do you want to hit me  whoa oh Dan's not there what oh whoa oh wow where' Dan go okay well cool well we'll uh we'll find a Dan we'll find a Dan later we'll get a new Dan yeah Dan do you want to hit me with a with a merch message I mean got a couple Dan as
it is we've got Dan seagull we've got oh better Dan yeah better Dan that's what I call him only Dan only Dan dan.com probably don't say that domain it's probably a thing it's probably a thing like all mustached men with a lot of body hair stop it stop it please please sir it's okay this is why we can't have nice things it's why we can't have only dance.com oh my God I at it here uh you're going to give me so much traffic too bad you're stuck yeah forever hey lonus did you ever give out
hot chocolate to people in line at NC kitum Boxing Day Sale probably oh I remember NC used to do like weird things like that dude our boxing day and like Grand Opening Day events yeah they were events kind of cool actually they were actually fun like I'd go out and I'd do like crowd work and like Huck swag into the crowd and stuff and like it was it was man when NC was firing on all cylinders it was actually a pretty cool company overall and a pretty pretty cool place to work now not every one had the
same experience I did I I got to acknowledge that I um I was told multiple times by multiple people that I was sort of a favorite child and uh no way enjoyed a bit of a privileged position there um but I will say that dang it it's the second time I've done that it's the second time today I've tried to put it on with the thing dude whoo that's a lot of thermal past that's fine you just gooped it up eh yeah are we putting the other fans on here or just one uh I've been putting the second 
win man it's actually kind of fun to uh it's kind of fun to bring Jake on for our sweet 16 because you must have been 16 when you started I was 15 actually for for like 26 more days I was 15 at the time that's crazy are you even allowed to work here when you're 15 I think so I think it's 14 you can start at 14 in BC really I mean it seems like the kind of thing Ivon would have figured out and she's actually the one who hired him I wouldn't have yeah I wouldn't have clear
clear attitude problems oh definitely Pro Problem Child 100% what did you do to impress her during the interview I actually don't know much about your hiring it was Luke that made the Luke is the reason that I got hired because they gave me this just like very poopy pre-production small form factor case and was like take it apart because I guess somebody no nobody spent the time to take it apart beforehand so I could assemble it on camera or not on camera for the interview let's say no we specifically
built it we rebuilt it every time oh yeah no that was a thing believe you no it no that's 100% a thing as I was taking it apart I was like wow this thing kind of sucks W the tolerances are kind of weird here like H why do they do it like this just like kind of reviewing it as I was doing it not intentionally and then Luke I guess was like yeah we should hire that guy that is pretty cool I mean we didn't hire him as a writer initially no um well those didn't exist back then yeah oh well they kind of did
like Luke and Luke and John Luke and John were kind of writers at that time I don't know if we we didn't really call it that though but no Jake was our warehouse guy yeah otherwise known as Linus's personal assistant he did mostly just do whatever I needed um done because I didn't have time well I never got to organize the warehouse or anything like that because every time i' get to work on the limited amount of hours I would work in a week there would just be so much stuff on my desk to deal
with with no information no sticky note no hey can you do this no I would put a deal with sticky note Jake deal with STI deal with this can you can you deal with this and that's it what is this I don't know what do I need to deal with huh those are all Minor Details those are all Minor Details so like half of my hours would be finding him and being like hi what do you want me to do with this and then doing the thing and never actually cleaning anything up yeah so I mean that's why that's why he got fired
from that position because he never actually cleaned the warehouse listen I never officially got fired from that position I think it said General laborer on my like pay stubs for like four [Laughter] years well we didn't In fairness In fairness we didn't really have like job titles at that time yeah that's that's fair like we didn't really have uh like clear like clear um like positions in the company really um I don't know this is just sounding like copium to me so I'm just going to I'm not making excuses
for it I'm I think I'm meeting it pretty head on here it was a pretty random time and we we didn't have a Nobody Got Time for like bureaucracy at that time I don't even remember the time before we had snacks yeah dude snacks were such a GameChanger for me it's a problem cuz when the snacks are not refilled it's like we everyone in the office becomes a little bit feral this especially him it happened recently because uh I was told because of the uh the strikes our recent snack delivery was delayed oh that's
reasonable so that's why that's why we didn't have snacks and it's like look mhm no everything's fine don't point the camera over here point it at him I didn't do anything I didn't drop a laptop that wasn't me that dropped that laptop remember that right that was me I can I can show you guys a closer look at that in a minute if you want it's not it's not good uh it's not great did you just take my screwdriver oh no you didn't I thought about it I looked at it and went this would make it difficult
for him to win I could see the look on his face and I heard a screwdriver move that was all the information I had knowing me that's a reasonable assumption I've been hanging around with this guy for a minute or two so it seemed pretty likely the only screwdriver that I will ever steal from you is that clear one and you know it's just sitting in a drawer actually oh really you don't even use it no I just like to look at it sometimes and feel a sense of accomplishment I really want to bring
the clear screwdriver to Market but there were issues with the mold oo cable manage this I got to fix this here good night yeah thanks seriously yeah you're how does this happen every single time look how much of the table I get you're little it's fine and look how much of the table he gets we both have the same size computer the computer takes up the same amount of space the person doesn't Jake looks bigger what hey Jake's looks bigger is that what you said hey Jordan how are we doing for
time h no no I mean each machine each machine what's our what's our how's our time trending on a per machine basis ah do this you have 13 minutes left no no I know but how how are we tracking I've told you several times I'm not tracking that but some someone's got to tell us so that we canun internet tell you you should have internet what is going on I'm well aware I'm trying to make it work I will come do teex support for you okay Jake do you still use the 7900 XTX I do actually
Casper explore on FL plane was asking it's actually been really solid okay Tex support bye the only there's one with like time you know actually my computer has been a massive steaming pile of doodoo for ages like in terms of stability um but it wasn't the graphics card's fault it was pretty much in it it ended up being an audio issue that was causing it oh you were telling me about this yeah oh boy so the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6 seemed to make this problem substantially worse and I'm not really
sure why but I apparently other people have experienced weird audio issues with it anyways the game would crash I'd be like playing it'd be like it's it was always like between one and in 2 minutes before the end of the game and then my whole everything would just pause and I could still hear but then you'd hear like an like a peak in the audio and then the game would resume and the last thing that I would think the last thing I'd think if my audio is the only thing that's working yeah is that the issue is
my sound Hardware yeah yeah and uh it was actually so how did you diagnose that again the audio uh I reinstalled Windows after like trying literally everything I possibly could to not have to reinstall Windows um and then I hadn't installed the audio interface drivers yet cuz it has like a default Windows driver that it uses uh when you don't have the drivers everything was fine installed the audio interface drivers and then everything went to crap immediately after I was like it's got to be that
uninstalled them it stopped crashing so I bought a new audio interface which one are you using now uh it's a Motu M4 I I hadn't heard of this brand before but I looked up online like measurements of like ooh the signal to noise ratio and they were good and it seems to work pretty nice it's got a little screen on the front wow signal to noise ratio that really takes me back like uh AIG ZX reviews you know nobody really looks at that anymore the thing with like cheap audio interfaces is so many of them are
built just with the nearly the exact same Hardware right and they're all just kind of whatever so I was trying to find something that's like in a decent price category like 2 to 300 or maybe 400 Canadian uh that was maybe a little bit better for whatever reason and this seems to be quite a bit better than those other it looked like a good one yeah I was investigating some Motu stuff for my own setup and any driver issues since then no okay so confirm which one was the bad
one then if you don't mind us calling them out you know I think call is reason did you steal my GPU what no I don't have your GPU what is it doing that here uh here let me un un prinkle this it was a art art oh you bought the cheap stuff voice channel it's not that cheap it's like a $600 Canadian it's a full Channel strip that's why I like it it had like dser EQ uh Noise Gate compressor all built into it's supposed to be like all the stuff you need for mic in one channel St yeah yeah that's
nice um and it had it also has an interface in it that's why originally got it is because it was everything in one right and then but as it turns out Allin ones can sometimes be more trouble than they're worth um oh man Andy came in he's expecting me to do like some kind of dad joke punch line I think no Andy I got nothing I got absolutely nothing for that uh Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message though yeah sure might required to put all the screws in you I mean no one's
required to do anything Jake so I didn't put any of the screws in before putting the graphics card in and that just occurred to me so I don't know if I can actually reach them all I think I can nice I got one here that's more of a comment first sure hit me down thank you lonus for all you've done for short people representation uh and then another one here from Philip will CPU pillows make a return um we do have some alpaca wool that we kind of need to figure out what to do with dude we need to bring back
the bread I I think I don't know if the bread's coming back but I think someone floated the idea of bringing back the CPU pillow to to get rid of some alpaca wool ah yeah we just we just like I think it's appreciated in the time we've had it so like I don't know it's appreciated good investment I thought you weren't big on the whole investing in ston thing well alpaca wool is hardly a stock I mean it's it's it's stock like we have it in stock but it's not like stun is alpaca wool a registered
security yeah I really uh I really don't think so is there is there somebody that like approves those I guess it has to be listed on a ston exchange yeah I would think so is there a website called stons exchange or something I don't look it up please yeah don't look it up it's probably a scam or other things that are not good yeah man it's kind of crazy how sort of scary the internet has gotten like I don't know you might be too young for this but we used to use the term surf the
web like we would we would I'm too young to have heard that term no not to have heard heard the term but for like surfing the web being a reasonable thing to do what it's you surf the web you're going to find some stuff dude I mean I have it's always kind of been like that I have seen some things on the internet no I okay that I know we're not talking about that right now I don't think it got better I yeah I don't I don't know what kind of like no I'm saying I think it's gotten worse wild what was the Wild
oh yeah 100% it's gotten worse I thought you're saying it got better I'm like no I'm saying like you used to be able to surf the web and probably not everything was trying to steal your personal data and it wasn't just four websites like you'd get inundated with ads and stuff I think everything is still trying to steal your data you're just like no no everything is now oh I mean I mean like you could surf the web you know and probably not everything was like a catastrophe you know like every site you
go to is just trying to fish you um I don't know it just feels like it feels like the internet is as dangerous if not more dangerous than ever oh is there meant to only be one piece CPU power I scratch this side panel but no one's going to know because I'm going to pull out oh a super awesome move here and no one will ever notice oh you're going to stick the sticker on there I'm going to stick the sweet 16 sticker on there right where the scratch beautiful is there meant to
only be one CPU power connector uh yes why because otherwise we don't have enough pcie um connectors on the power supply to plug in the RGB interface thing the RGB interface fine you don't need it what you trading me c power okay okay sure you can do your job we have a moment oh okay hey Jaa mids spot look at that we mentioned earlier that we're going to be selling each of the builds "we're doing today for $1,600 on Java so" why don't we take a look at what we'll be up against in their gaming PC section
and Dan's doing that oh or do I go over there oh cool go over there okay so we just punch in a price range and let's go with verified sellers apparently um they've been vetted by the Jawa team so you know they'll stand behind what they're selling and we're supposed to look at two to three listings and give some thoughts okay cool I am currently looking for verified sellers okay can you just uh filter by verified sellers here what about sort bu the link I gave you had that already on there oh you
gave me another link isn't this a different link script cool oh that's not okay this is a smooth production today we didn't go over that earlier we did that's fine guys okay children don't squabble please feel like I'm listening to my kids in the back of the oh boy this is embarrassing which one's your favorite all right one sec uh it what do we got here oh yeah we got this we got this don't even worry it's okay I'm sure it's my fault wow what is happening right now this is a a
weird way he sure does good gravy what is this interface there we go verified sellers okay cool verifi oh okay and this is all in kind of our price point okay well one of them is us okay here's a Pro Gamer PC 12700 KF RTX 470 TI 32 K ddr5 this actually pretty competitive that's a that's pretty nice I think we we have oh yeah I know we also have a 750 wat power supply um what do we have over this we've got a newer CPU we've got a 7800x 3D I'd say our GPU is um we've got a 7800 XT so we're probably
reasonably close to this though if I had the choice I might actually prefer the 470 ETI super uh we've got uh I think we've probably got a slightly nicer case are we including Windows window like real Windows is included oh yeah we okay we got real Windows that's good Windows 11 Pro cool okay that's a nice little machine what else we got here it's got RGB and everything um uh here let's uh that one looks cool sure yeah let's look at that "one it's got orange, 1600 bucks got the"
same GPU as us we've got a slightly better CPU a little bit more SSD storage we have two terabytes but they've also got 32 gigs of RAM there are some there are some pretty decent deals on here not bad neat all right cool um so my my notes say it may look like we're underpricing our builds a little and I guess we are a little bit like I think we're quite competitive with what's on there um but the only way we were able to do that was that the brands that provided these uh these parts for us
they didn't charge us for them when they heard that we were doing this for charity they were like pretty excited to get on board just like Jawa and uh sent over a lot of this stuff for nothing so we thought hey that's way our buyers get a little bit more bang for their Buck the system should sell out quickly and we're still able to provide a pretty solid donation to our local food bank in time for the holiday season pretty cool little project it's been a lot of fun today uh how's your system going Jake
you just about done you uh you done taking advantage of your huge huge time Advantage you got just there what happened did you put the io Shield Plate in oh yeah did Jake put an IO shield in of course I put an you are the first are you joking you are the first of our non- Linus Builders to put in an IO Shield I have built a few computers in my day all of the other ones left out the io Shield where the devil is my every computer in my household that it is possible to miss
it on it is missing um Jake did you take my GPU I didn't take your GPU did someone take my GPU I actually don't think I have it what oh oh no it's in a box oh man all the other ones were in uh were in antistatic bags so I just assumed it be in an estd bag all right Dan do you want to hit me with merch message or wait Jordan are there any are there any things on your list I'm supposed to do oh probably I oh probably all right we'll give them a minute we'll give talked about them already you're
good all right Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah is there anything stopping me from just turning this on now uh a power plug maybe oh well yeah thanks hi lonus just got married in October and leaving soon for a 3we honeymoon in Hawaii W congrats any vacation tips for making this trip extra memorable we haven't gone on a trip like this since 2016 I mean I can tell you right now now given that it's been a minute um it's probably going to be pretty darn
memorable oh man I'm trying to think is there a monitor oh this thing in the middle that's the testing cart this is very much this is very much Personal Taste but I find the pictures that I actually look back on most fondly are not the posed ones yes candid oh buy a disposable camera and then just take some silly photos that don't overthink the photos the ones of actual memories for sure are definitely better than posed ones I agree looking back at just like I don't know the kids
hanging out in the room you know reading books and you know watching TV and just like chilling or like I don't know just like the the the picture of everyone walking down the street you know you don't have to be in front of a famous landmark um and for me anyway I find the the most meaningful memories are the ones where it was you know nobody really posed uh you maybe just like make a noise to you know get the Younglings attention but other than that it's just uh in the moment you know capturing
what everyone was doing um I've also found that lately I've started to take more just like short little video clips um you know just a couple minute video of like one of my kids explaining the story they wrote or um talking about their day at school or whatever else and those have been a lot of fun to to go back and and watch as well yeah put it on outside of the plastic seriously well cuz then if the person doesn't want it they can peel it right you're not peeling everything are
you but then if they do want this thing got to get shipped bro why why you peeling all the stuff oh I'm not peeling all the stuff I you just all those things you peeled what what are you talking about you peeled that yeah that has nothing to do with scratched in shipping that's a Fan Hub I'm putting it on here don't put it on the plastic don't put it on the plastic you got to put under the plastic peel up the plastic put on and then put down the plastic person that gets this they're
not going to leave this no stop it no I'm not doing that no I'm not going to put it there just leave the plastic God you guys would have worked now he can't win cuz his system won't be complete I'm putting it over here what did you do you steal something got them I put the sticker on the back kind of poorly so that it can come off easily oh my goodness where can I test this thing uh you can plug it in over there um Dan are we working on getting the times for all the systems I have to throw the laptop
on the floor first right yeah are you able to do that am I on the ground Jordan do you want to like just ask the chat please I don't have chat I didn't screw the power supply in what chat help chat oh what I can still win this you got time go go go go go let's go let's go speed GPU install this is why did I put the side panel back on here we go oh he's got a side panel on and everything oh dude I can totally win this all I got  not that this is a competition because Quality quality is actually far more
important for these machines than uh getting them done quickly because they will be going to some of you who are buying them you know quality first but anywh who trust me bro is this another 7800 XT yep all right it's a brand new one too yeah those ones are from colorful oh colorful sent it oh that's nice of them okay hey look at that and a side panel oh we got a power supply in place race is on and a front panel who can grab the cables first cables grabbed yeah he's already got the cables which I
think is actually kind of a cheat personally chat is not helping I think that's kind of a cheat person what did you say chat is not helping I they said at least five well if you're done this one now you've caught up I'm done you've caught up you have 30 seconds left pencils down let's go good work let's go how many more you know to go I couldn't help noticing that uh why computer was done let's see if his post already plugged in what you yeah but he that's cool because he stole the cables before
he was actually done the guy what do you mean I was it I put it in literally after all right well let's see let's see let's see if it fires up camera in the way my bad let's see if it fires up here  go oh wait yeah don't no no don't get us copyright strike copy strike well while we're waiting for that let's see if Jake can guess the next uh year Le ooh sure the next what that'll be fun yearly memory so the last one was the fire truck nice oh there's a a specific memory so
2013 2014 what do you think was the most viewed video in that year from November to November that 2013 I have no idea were you alive then no I'm still not alive no guesses what am I going to guess I don't all right L you got a guess I made a terrible  so we may have to see who can fix it first to determine who actually won mistake what do you mean we both made a terrible mistake of what uh we both forgot to bend up the tab on the DP on the io Shield forgot to bend up the tab oh honey that's awful who in
there why you unplug my computer who Do You Think You Are pull back oh jeez I did it on all three of the other ones and I kept getting large knife pulled away from this build and uh so Jake's taking the triy oh yeah uh Andy you'll have to go get a look at it uh Jake is worse if you want to get a better look at it whoa you speak for yourself there mister Jake is Jake's is much worse there's nothing wrong with Mine mine's great uh-huh I need to not stubby screw driver great knif you just
have a knife stuffed in there there's a nothing relax Dan everything's going to be okay buddy oh boy oh boy where did you get a knife don't worry about I guess we're in a kitchen everything's fine everything's beautiful everything's great I'm just uh going to go ahead and do this I'm so sorry to lus already got blood on a couple of the other ones so that's totally fine all right good it's only kind of sharpen did you mangle it no that's not the proper way come look at the thing it's mint
listen sir that's not the I work on BMWs all the time I that's all I do is mangle it's not mangling it if you un mangle it after and nobody notices all right Andy I'll let you be the judge like a true mechanic you might have to turn it so Andy can see turn un mangle it a little bit you see it's a little sharp it's a little sharp like the knife I used to do it and then we're just going to go like that bend it back a little bit if you're plugging in cable it should be fine yeah
okay so I get Andy's vote why would you plug into the DP on the motherboard when it has line is well why would you want to maybe short it out got some tape yeah no it's still bad to leave it there you to be clear you don't want it in there sometimes it can actually short things and sometimes your computer won't turn on because of that um rats here let me use the knife so much for being caught up now back some I'm properly properly properly listen to this cope we our Safety Committee when
we need them I I let me here I'll turn the knife away from my face then that's a good call oh my goodness cut to your friends not your face towards your friends not your face is that what you said Dan yeah that's the thing Dan would say all right yeah certainly lost many friends she's mint that's fine I mean it it did that by itself so you know are you still doing this what you doing over there I took the board out so that I could bend it back so that I could oh it ended up back in the port it did not I'm 
kidding guy that look all right um what next what does chat think uh who had the better method who wins chat yeah yeah I don't know chat usually sides against me just for the laws but I don't think they're going to like your knife method I'm going they knife remember these are computers that people are actually paying money for almost at this point knife lius Jake Jake knife I like knife okay they like the knife vote kick knife I don't I don't know Perfect all right thanks everybody
appreciate appreciate your support out there here Andy here Andy all right thanks Jake thanks for popping in bye thanks for being the first one to actually build a functioning computer well I mean it might crash who knows yeah it still could I mean we did boot it up once with a thing shorting up the display port Port where where do you want this on the on the table this one over here oh you want on that table that was the idea yeah hey did we ever did we ever figured out that most viewed video
no did Jake take a guess no checken out I don't have well I don't have anything like there's nothing in my brain that the answer the field you know the drop down on the web page is empty that yeah well like that's not a surprise L do you have a guess ah what was the year again uh I think  I'm going to say yeah I'm going to say over 10 years uh uh a 480 GTX unboxing no no okay well um it was more similar to the previous year okay give me the give me a thumbnail give me a thumbnail then oh
boy it probably says the product name oh no way really yep it was the Arctic hobby excavator are you kidding me I didn't even remember there was an excavator remember when I said all of them earlier I thought I said all of them I said the tank I said the boat I think you missed that one yeah I forgot the excavator even existed that's hilarious why were you doing like toys like this oh I explained it earlier so I'm not going to explain it again for the people who will be
bored by the second explanation but um I barely listen to basically it was a favor to a colleague who brought them in and needed help moving them and really it ended up being a favor yeah oh dude I ended up being absolutely stoked stoked on how that turned out should I be cable managing this real quick or um did you not I mean I did I mean it's it's in there so are you even done the computer turned on are you even done I I'll put a couple zip ties I leave now moment of truth let's see if
mine works you still haven't figured that out yet tested that no I didn't test yet wow oh dude I wasn't going to turn it on with that thing sticking in there you were until you realized well I was until I oh cuz I believe in a little thing called quality controls otherwise known as he had prior knowledge insider trading just saying oh it's not prior knowledge to know that those St things can go in there does my computer still work maybe I'm just wondering knife gang hey look at that it
does that's awesome uh I can show you what happened to the cable if you guys would like um those of you who were tuned into the stream earlier will know that I accidentally knocked my computer off of this test cart and when that happened it landed on my cable um it's a USBC cable but it's an in not an Audi H here's what here's what used to here's what used to be in it TMI there you go that's a bummer I liked this cable sorry what did you say you're good hey nice I posted okay so uh I'm going
to move on to my next my next adventure see you later Jake see you thanks for playing all right okay who's next your next adventure is cake break cake break oh wait do we get cake we get cake yay nice I haven't left yet I stayed for the cake all right uh should I have chat maybe I can I you can take my mic if you want how you guys doing uh all right I longer connected to my Wi-Fi so chat is no longer updating sick hey Dan hey Dan I love all my fans you want to hit me with a merch message yeah I
got loads here for you all right uh hey ldr J happy birthday LT what Personal Achievement throughout ltt's life are you most proud of go Personal Achievement um that's a tough one right because you'd have to go what is the best person achiev Personal Achievement yeah you so you'd have to go back I was about to say you'd have to go back to the very early days to find anything that I did completely by myself oh is it because of is it because of this pendant I'm wearing yeah I think
so it's it's protecting us is it blocking all the 5G yeah H uh okay in all seriousness though is my you're you're good my mic good Okay cool so I was going to say I'd have to go pretty far back to find things that I personally achieved completely on my own and then I was thinking no even back really far like I always had someone holding a camera for me I always had some kind of help so um I don't know if I had to pick something I'd say being a real company you know where where people pay their
bills and feed their families and uh snack and have snackies in the kitchen you know yeah we have free snackies most of the time most of the time all the good stuff goes pretty fast U but there's there's almost always something there if you're desperate enough um that would be that would be a really interesting like uh data point for like a snack company to have like they just go into a company right and put in like like 20 of everything and then just like gauge how fast they all
disappear and that's like their it's like the it's like the disappearing food taste index of quality you know that that would be a very interesting metric anyway am I supposed to open this yeah all right we've got a we've got a cake break has anyone like partake oh wow well that's cute  bombs I'm going to go with balloons ah right yes good you're you're upside down In fairness to Me In fairness to me it was going this way okay they kind of  bombs I'm also playing dumb a little bit
uh okay so I'm supposed to am I supposed to cut the cake do I just do the first cut just do a first cut here yeah okay I'm not going to just stand here and cut cake the whole time okay and we've got Cas going to the other buildings as well so oh really oh that's fun all right happy Sweet 16 LT let's go um all right so should I just be should I should I just be awful and like do this you whatever you want for your  nice okay people hate it when I eat on stream so I might just have like one bite for
now people people get extremely angry when I eat on stre wait I'm coming for yeah yeah get in here all right I'm here you used my knife for your cake that's your knife what was the cake knife mine now it's a computer knife you can have it this knife is probably it's been some places no B washed it oh you did yeah oh nice it's a it's our prop knife it like actually lives on the kitchen here we used to have a little magnetic knife thing but now we don't anymore okay I'm going to put this aside for me for now
BR victim here am I starting my next yep I got to switch your mic pack battery line I don't want can you see what he's doing Andy look what he's doing look what he's doing there are worse things I could do I was going to cut the 16 out of the middle so he seriously just cut that wow D I've got one here yeah swap lus is pack for me yep please while so he can eat some you see the kind of things that I deal with around here give me your pack while you eat totally reasonable what is the
problem one person's going to get a little angled piece that's fine listen you have lost your night privileges so just relax all right are  trick this is we're not doing this here I I am right now actively see and lovely see you later all right see you later Andy hi second Andy what's up man where my go it's over there uh does someone want to take an end of this so that we can get the computer builds going again oh my goodness um this is dangerous yeah the knife is just kind of hanging off of it um let's
put that out here yeah yeah we'll we'll we'll take it out there we'll take it out there Take It Outside we'll let other people have cake yeah let them eat  Marie uh sure you can follow him for you want let's go talk to Dan see you later Andy see what Dan's up to there you go they're back all right cool oh man wow this has been quite the stream today oh look we're going to get another competently built PC it's John from the lab thank goodness our first three in a row our first three guest Builders didn't put
the io shield on and our fourth guest Builder put the io shield on but had the tab sticking into the display port Port the part that I left off is that I also did that on the fourth Bild but I didn't do it on any of the three prior so I'm still giving myself a a 75% passing grade here for building PCS that's fair all right so clock's running we've got half an hour you think you can uh John do you think you can build a computer in half an hour absolutely not yeah for sure but you ask him to build a test
bench he just slaps him in there you wouldn't believe the way this man builds test benches but you throw you show him a case he don't exist he gets confused he's all like Mama he just doesn't he I'm I'm making all of this up obviously so you you haven't been on you haven't been on camera that much tell us something about JN that the audience is unlikely to know uh I did archery competitively for 13 years okay I also did not know that so is that like um do you bring that up cuz
it's like a threat or uh how fast can you run if you uh make it that way got it excellent um why I no not that not that that's a weird thing to do I'm just I'm just wondering why archery uh started as uh when we were on vacation in Mexico one year um we saw oh there's archeries so we went there they totally had the bow string wrong and everything so it was a bad time um and then for my birthday the next year my uh parents actually took me to an archery club and then since then I
was enamored by it you're just hooked yeah yeah and then nowadays I if it shoots i' probably have shot it that's cool you know it's funny cuz even though I like you know was teasing you a little bit oh why archery um that was like my favorite thing at summer camp that was my favorite station and we had this uh we had this little Sporting Goods store and the only reason that I'm thinking of it right now is because we we had uh we had lunch across the street from it last weekend with the family and I was like
oh my God I don't remember what it's called anymore but there's this little sporting goods store in Ladner where I used to love going in there because they had all kinds of like like cool bows and cool arrows and I was a kid and I didn't understand what the heck any of it was but I always found I always found the bow M more interesting than the gun and I don't I couldn't tell you why I just they're more elegant I just love the I love I love drawing it back now the thing that everyone's going to need
to know here is what's your archery style what do you mean do you get all the glasses and everything have one hand in the pocket that would be prettyy dope I mean it would I it would be pretty hard with a bow but you could do it you just set up a rig yeah so so did do you have the cool glasses and stuff or you just like no I had a pretty good competition bow though it was an actual shoot through one instead of having it was a a compound bow um and typically you don't knock it
on the side it goes like through the thing yeah so what about the feathers though um so the way that it has a drop rest um most competition bows for compounds have drop rest drop rest yeah you're going to have to give me a little more detail on what a drop rest is uh so normally an arrow rests on uh a rest of some sort that's not directly on the bow because if it didn't rest on a rest what would it rest on yeah exactly don't don't settle for the rest settle for the best rest sorry
H okay so normally you've got to you have some kind of rest yeah so this one the way it works is it would uh attach to the actual compound strings and as you draw back it lifts up um and then when you release it it would actually drop the rest down so that the arrow is not actually touching anything as it's flying what yes but then wouldn't it like go down no because the arrow is already mid-flight huh okay sure and that's good because cuz then you don't have anything potentially influencing the flight 
see oh okay I'm having a very hard time wrapping my brain around why how it would not kind of start to go down a little bit but I will take your word for it because I know far less about archery than um you do so when did did when did  competing what year would that have been I think I was 22 oh okay so like quite recently then I wish I was that young still 20 oh 22 years old yeah yeah I thought you meant 2022 all right never mind okay fair enough we need the or the Blues Blue on
1700 right I think so I think so too we're both going with I think so so this is either going to go 100% great for both of us or a epic fail for both of us we'll see how how it goes yeah um pretty sure it's blue pretty sure it's blue they're they're colorcoded standoffs for our you have the instruction booket I don't you don't have a booklet no I don't have one in mine I must have thrown it out I'm pretty darn sure it's blue uh yeah it is all right Jordan you've got some stuff for us so oh we
want to thank uh we want to thank the folks Who provided the hardware real quick here uh Intel sent over eight CPUs for our builds actually now is as good a time as any to have a look at what we're using oh these are great we've got core i7 14700 KF processors we're not going to need the onboard Graphics because we're going to have gpus for our builds and this gives us what are these like 20 core or something stupid like that hopefully the BIOS is up to date on these lot a flipping
uh and the packaging the packaging on oh no they still do I can can you remember how many cores a 14700 K has oh God me out John the the product the product lineups have gotten so complicated and there's a barcode over top of my sticker they used to say how many cores they had on them they don't anymore that's weird Dan help me is it 20 cores on a 14700 K KF oh chat 14 chat's there for me yeah I think it's I think it's 1420 chat says no all right how many cores is it hit me chat hit me chat it's
on the prompter oh nice hey that'll  Intel builds hey there we go 20 cores 20 cores 28 threads that's the one that's what I said right did I say 20 totally  sick what are these things turbo to do I have that too look at that they turbo up to 5.6 gz got got all the little specs there anyway Intel sent these over so that when we are selling these on java. the entire value of the CPU can go to charity so it's going to be going to one of our local food banks which is a pretty important thing to contribute to
this time of year all right Jordan hit me with a hit me with a challenge or you can throw over to Dan for a merch   challenge this is such an organized stream we're celebrating 6 years of streaming challenges all right I'm good you think we would have figured it out by now no no maybe after 32 uh so let's do a pricing challenge  truck they weren't cheap I remember them being like you know not completely ridiculous unreasonable but certainly not cheap uh see "wasn't it like 1,200 or something like"
that no no way no that would been way back in the day I'm going to say that the RC fir truck was was 2012 in 2012 I'm going to say it was $330 that sounds like a good guess you're high actually I'm high how dare you 2 270 the price I found on an archived page from ncx was 99 bucks Canadian wow that no that was on promo that was like on clearance to get rid of them for sure I promise you all right I promise you I believe you now our videos weren't sophisticated enough back then to have
so much as a like print screen screenshot of the of the product page so we're not going to be able to go back and look at what it cost when it was first launched but there's no way that it was $99 that would have been a sick value for 100 bucks it was actually interesting going back because I found a video of you talking about why we never talk about prices in our videos oh really yeah cuz you wanted them to be Evergreen yes we gave up on that after a certain point yes it turns out that when
you review a product people for the most part want you to talk about the value of it and we particularly ran into trouble with that during the Great GPU pricing um during the uh the covid lockdowns and the the crypto mining boom because we tried to kind of uh this this was before your time John um but we tried to kind of review a GPU in the context of like how it fit into the rest of the lineup relative pricing against what relatively speaking existed rather than kind of get into that everything's a
terrible value and absolutely nothing makes any sense and everything is horrible and you're talking about the landscape today is just perfect well it's funny because people talk far less about how bad it is right now it's cuz it's normalized but it's not that much better like as far as I can tell the GPU manufacturers I mean especially Nvidia because being the market leader they kind of set the curve they basically saw H so they'll pay that much and we're like okay well we have
effectively a semi Monopoly in this space in this discret gaming GPU space St are they already installed uh yes they're already installed all right cool um so we have no incentive whatsoever to ever adjust pricing back down so things did come down a little but we are nowhere near and you don't have to go back that far we are nowhere near what you know the reasonable pricing we saw for 30 series was it's kind of wild actually how we've all just kind of gone okay well I guess that's what it GPU
costs now yeah I'm not a fan be honest with you yeah like gaming well gaming still is accessible I mean part of that is thanks to uh gpus thanks to companies like our sponsor jaw. G who uh makes it easy to buy secondhand gpus but brand new gpus like brand new current gen gpus are really really expensive these days all right Dan do you want to hit me with my message yeah sure I've got a bunch here if you want to do a couple sure hey lonus finally getting my hands on the screwdriver what
will be the next episode of wacky water cooling solutions with Alex and Linus truly my favorite series on the channel ooh wacky water cooling with Alex and lonus what do we have planned I know that we want to do something in the office like some kind of some kind of whole room water cooling of some sort but I've kind of talked about this on Wan show our our office situation here may change at some point um and so I don't think we're looking to do anything big to this building right
now although that that depends cuz we may just not be able to find anything so iio Shield not matter uh no it's built in oh yeah that's right no it was only the yeah okay that's funny because I look I'm like what I mentioned to him when we started yeah hey three people four didn't manage to put in an IO Shield yeah we're using a different board now we're on our Intel platforms now and they have an integrated IO Shield you go so everything's fine um anyway wacking wacky water cooling
solutions I want to get one of those water cooled air conditioners um and yeah but that might be a lonus and Jake thing because that'll probably be for the server room at my house so that we can finally have it not be stupid I had a leak this weekend actually I might have uh I might have a picture of what happened on my phone yeah here let me let me see if I have a picture it was not good though and this jerk I message him on the weekend I'm like yeah that thing that you like
helped me build is is leaking all over the place um I I was helpful and you were like LOL oh well it was funny you were like holding it with your finger it was it was ridiculous I send okay John I send him this and his response is LOL because just put a bucket under it cuz it would drain the whole Loop so so the fitting on there just snapped off no no no you snapped it off no I didn't dude it did not just explode itself no it did just you were just standing in the room and it just exploded Jake I
showed your stepdad what happened to it so if you look at it if you look at it cuz it's a it's a clear plastic it's like a polycarb poly but kind ofle PL and if you look at it of the ofed is shiny like a like a crack like a sudden break and then there's like 20% of it where it sheared off where I went to tighten it cuz I thought it was just loose cuz it was like it was spewing water so I went to tighten it and the whole thing just immediately came off I barely touched it so you know you know I
was saying it was straight before I found a photo of when we installed it and the valve was straight so I think something like fell off that table or got knocked off and hit it and that's why it was leaking but anyways can I get you to say a sentence on stream that's going to make no sense to the stream but I need for something else I gu is this an audio pickup for a video it how you recording it this this is how I'm screen recording the live stream it's going to be seriously yep okay that's going to be
trash quality okay you're good so with that said so with that said until the end of the day December 2nd cool that's all you need that's all I need thanks sure update for your line oh that's how we do it I know what video that's for I know what video that's for we are finally announcing the product that um the the nas software that I made my my second hey this really needs to exist and I guess if I don't fund it nobody else will my my second Tech investment um into a Nas software and there's going
to be some some kind of special offer that is only available for a limited time I guess that's the new time window for it very cool very very very TR cool I have a sales update for you oh sales update we are sold out we're sold out of what out of our ja computers wait all these computers are gone yep oh you better get them done does that mean we can end the stream and go home they're all built yeah we can just leave I mean if we've already got the money what does it matter right thanks CU I became a
camera person you became a camera person oh we sold out all of them y he's that powerful yeah that that's the power of John that's why we don't let him go on camera because the entire industry is going to be in shortage it's going to be like look at look at that mug I want to  computer oh that's fantastic thank you guys so much so that means that we are contributing like what what what is it work out to like about 20 grand it'll depend on shipping but yeah it work out "to about 20 22 23,000 us to uh local"
food banks that's awesome thank you so much you guys super cool every time we do stuff like this I'm like oh we should do this kind of stuff more often but it's a ton of work it's like actually a ton of work setting up for streams like this so so we're we're still going to do it we're going to we're going to do them um we're going to do them as often as uh as we can make it make sense but uh yeah that that that's why they don't happen just like every week or whatever oh wow
if to go back and do this one again I think I might put the cooler in after the fact because this is not as roomy a case as the first one we were working in it's definitely nice that it's really compact but it is not the roomiest I also may have found one other small challenge um mine are bigger well I mean I can work in it yes that is my superpower but it's a little trickier to work in also I may have noticed one small problem because we're using higher profile memory yeah I was
concerned about that too I think this fan is not going to be uh inside the computer um we might be able to put it on the reverse side I think we can get away with the one fan on the nhd15 on this thing this is only a 14700 I okay hold on May you know what we could do um is we could just pull from our inventory and get some 120 mil f for the secondary and then we could put 120s on there that's what we did in the Caris machine okay yeah let's let's do that so maybe Jordan can you just
make a note that we're just going to for the Intel machines we're going to replace that 140mm fan with a 120 all right okay that should be fine uh have we shouted out our contributors for this oh no I haven't um Asus sent over eight motherboards and two gpus so the z790 plus Wi-Fi boards that we're using here were provided by Asus and then I guess we've got a couple gpus that we're going to be checking out later and because all of our Hardware Partners Who provided stuff for the stream today we're so
generous it means that pretty much the entire retail value of these machines that people are paying is going to be going to the food bank so that's super exciting we we set out to do this with the goal of contributing all of the profits for the builds and it turned out that once everyone found out what we were doing they were just like oh well here's all the hardware so then it's pure profit um so it's pure donation this is pretty cool and 16 people are going to get a pretty sick sick deal on a
computer I can't believe how fast these sold man can you imagine if we were a retailer just like building computers and selling them all day we could probably make a pretty good business out of that I should go full I should come full circle we should just become become  um I think it was you only have to change one letter on your sign in your office yeah and then it's no problem that would really that would really save a lot of money uh in the long run on changing that sign in my
office you know I have actually tried to buy nci.com yeah several times I make about a yearly offer every year or so I reach out and I make another offer but um I think that there's a bit of a disconnect between me and the current owner on the value of it so um until we can bridge that Gulf um I don't think it's going to happen and the thing but the thing is I can be patient and I don't think anyone else has lined up to buy it so uh time's on my side message yeah hit me Dan hey
everyone I have a question with my area having no services to build or repair C PCS and a lack of ways for people to get good support for their techniques any tips on starting to provide that myself I think that if we learned anything from that Facebook PC video a little while ago where we hired random people on Facebook to build PCS for us I think what we learned from that is that there is a shockingly active Marketplace of both buyers and sellers for Tech goods and services on these kinds of
marketplaces and if you were going to set up something like that and pursue a business like that for yourself the best thing to do would be to keep your overhead extremely low Market yourself on social platforms take it slow build up build up a client base build up referrals small businesses never never underestimate the importance of referrals as a small business and uh you know don't quit your day job immediately the cool thing about um you know tech support and tech jobs is most people
don't expect you know service while you wait for virus removal or reformatting a system or anything like that so just make sure you don't bite off more than you can chew get referrals and I don't see any reason why you couldn't build something like that up I think that it's um I mean I did make money when I was younger um building machines for people I think it's probably a little more challenging these days there's really not a lot of margin in the in the just like piece together parts and and build
a a PC for you business but there's also ways that you can be creative and help stretch a dollar for your clients um we ran into our Builder code name the profession who had some interesting Corners that they cut they were very upfront with us about it but using like uh an engineering sample CPU I wasn't a fan of the power supply they used uh but using an engineering sample CPU and some other creative techniques they managed to put together a very performant PC for the price and the only way that one of the
other builders was able to compete with it was that they literally were doing it for fun and were not making any money on it so believe the professional did end up outperforming the other person who was doing it as a side hustle and was trying to actually make money at it so if you're if you're creative if you if you find good deals there's there's a lot of uh there's a lot of good that can be done helping people get a bargain I came across a Reddit post I think it was last week where an elderly relative
accidentally bought like a 12-year-old computer for for for way too much money way way more than it was worth um I hate it when stuff like that happens I hate it when stuff like that happens and I hate how preventable it is because I've been saying for years that that's a big problem that I have with this like i7 branding this move away from any kind of meaningful po Ultra now I think it's just going to get more and more confusing as time goes on and so what I was going to say was I I think
there's a lot of room to do good by finding the bargains that are out there uh on you know older Hardware that is still perfectly serviceable and and keeping machines keeping machines uh you know on the battlefield or or Call of  were all right Dan hit me in classic L of Sebastian fashion my painters messed up the planned eggshell finish what am I leaving on the table for having matte finish walls scrub ability um eggshell basically just means that there's a little bit more resin in
the paint and it has a bit more of a of a glossy durable finish and so that means that when it comes time to wash it you're less likely to leave marks that are going to look kind of stupid it's not going to no indoor paint unless you're in like a I don't know like a a kitchen with a ton of moisture or something like that no indoor paint is likely to actually like flake Off the Wall unless you unless you live in my house what why what happens in your house um the previous owners did a
terrible job with the paint and they put uh water base over top of oil base okay that is a problem um and you don't worry you can prevent that all you got to go do is go get yourself a little thing nail polish remover as long as it has acetone in it you just need something with acetone you take a little bit of acetone you put it on a rag and then you you rub it in a in a discret spot on the wall I mean theoretically it doesn't matter cuz you're about to paint over it uh but you just rub it in a little
discret spot on the wall and if it comes off it's waterbased and if it doesn't come off then it's oil based and you just make sure that you paint on whatever matches what was already there if you want the best chance of adhesion so in general indoors there's not much risk of like the elements causing your paint to break down um but it just means that the nice finish won't last for very long matte will look better for like 45 minutes and then after that it will it will look worse that's why you put it on
the ceiling yes that's exactly why you put it on the ceiling that's why we use Matt on the ceiling um the other reason we use it on the ceiling is because matte hides imperfections much better did you paint in a previous life your house paint I had to paint my house oh okay there you um but it's going to get covered in spit much shut up um sorry my watch was talking to me uh yeah so we so one of the other reasons for the ceiling is they have these long long uninterrupted spaces and it's really hard to apply
drywall perfectly that's one of the reasons that stipple or popcorn ceiling exists is because it helps to mask any errors in the ceiling drywalling but what also helps mask it is matte paint is far less likely to draw the eye to a bump or imperfection uh what is going on right now wait who put this in here whoever pre-wired this put the power supply end at the top I was wondering why this eight pin   fine In fairness to them is has it has been overall helpful to have a lot of things
pre-applied uh Dan me with a merch message sure think just swapped over to an AMD system does AMD take advantage of dual Channel memory thinking of swapping out my b450 Mark I for one with four Ram slots but if it's not going to make a big difference I'll skip so your two slots are already dual Channel your four slots is just going to allow you to put two dims sorry I'm this cable TI is going to allow you to do two dims per one of your channels AMD does support two dims per
channel on their consumer platforms but not at the same speed as if you only run one dim per channel so I would say personally I would prefer to just use one dim per channel on Modern platforms because the speed difference is something that is probably going to be more not able than the difference of having more memory unless you know that you absolutely need more memory in which case um having more memory is more better so basically if you know you need more memory go for it if you aren't 100%
sure probably you aren't going to get a performance benefit from It Anyway two minutes how we've only got two minutes left well these uh cuz you started grilling me on archery well you didn't have to answer you could have been the responsible one and kept us on task I mean he's been pretty good it's not entirely on me what do you mean he's been pretty good I'm almost done too is this GPU in no oh no I I think we're a simar my uh motherboard cuz I cross threaded a screw oh no yeah yeah I think
we're pretty close there Jordan yep Mr he's been on task uh man just play okay there's so much RGB in here I don't want to deal with this what even is all of this welcome to Thermal take oh I don't want RGB I just want an easy build line is Edition don't plug it in h no that's what we did for Brad's computer he's like oh it's too bright no I'm going to plug it in I thought he liked vgb uh I plugged in his EK fans and they were on like rainbow mode the entire time set toe I'll pass 
I don't know I got a pair of side Cutters for if you want okay hit me Dan sure hi DM I work at media Mark the Best Buy of Europe why do you think these big box Tech shops don't sell many individual PC parts my store basically only sells ssds and thermal paste um I mean I yeah I know the answer to that there's no margin in it um finished system you're going to be supported not just by the margin on the system itself but a lot of the time there's much more generous um spa or spiff or MDF programs
that are attached to them so that's where you're actually making money in the PC industry is through marketing programs when you're a large retailer and on a motherboard you might make eight or nine points 10 points um on a CPU um like especially a popular high run rate model you're maybe making like five points I mean Microcenter famously sells so many of their CPUs at a loss right um so a lot of retailers just kind of look at that industry and they kind of go why like why am I bothering with this
when I can sell I can sell TVs which have a lot of the margins out of TVs these days but you know I can sell TVs I can sell um laptops I can sell I mean a l wow a lot of categories have really contracted over the years I was going to say cameras but like they're kind of dead uh the point is just there's other there's other categories that at least have some profit left in them and PC parts is not not a lucrative not a lucrative business all right you are now officially behind well your next
Challenger is here my next Challenger is here okay well that's fine I am close I am a lot closer than it probably looks or I am a lot farther than it probably looks and I'm not sure which one yet because I don't know how hard it's going to be to plug these cables into this power supply with this little room I'm certainly going to do my best oh you did the opposite way yeah you fool I know I yeah I know I know I did not do a very smart thing here oh no oh no we're Nvidia on this
one oh no I have to get all the way to the other end also did whoever wire this up wire it backwards no they didn't okay I oh man can I do this can I plug one of these 12 pin connectors in all the way in there what is that sound is that showing up on the mic yes oh okay good sounds like my neighbors are doing it during the stream ridiculous uh nope I cannot do this my small hands power does have limits I'm going to have to undo this power supply and plug in the modular cables and put it back in fortunately
that shouldn't take too long I thought you're supposed to be getting better at this yeah well he's got to reset cuz Intel now 3 minutes behind though yeah this is a very different this is a very different system with different qu this is like one four not like yeah I think so five of eight um has anyone at any point here figured out what our times are for the machines it is very very important to me and I cannot stress this enough that we figure this out at some point literally know one no I need to
know how much each system took is anyone watching at home able to go back in the will figure it out and get get us the times will the in andout times for each machine please thank it would mean so much to me the entire title of the video is building PCS until I get good at it but we can't quantify it until we know how long they take to build I will go through everything now well you're not so much uh hey Dan what maybe put that on pause can I get a merch message well don't complain about it
then do you think PC electronics are sturdier than that of a decade or more ago example I had multiple GeForce 8800 gtx's and the cards only ever lasted just passed their warranty and even the motherboard suffered issues no not even a little bit um man the the tolerances are so tight these days uh things are things run hotter um bpec these days I I don't think I've seen I don't think I've seen anything to indicate that the electronics manufactured today are are more robust there are things that are
there are things that are I think if we were to go back to electrolytic capacitors that would be a a big problem for the longevity of our Electronics but I think all other things being equal you know you man like John you've probably dug you know a PCB out of some uh you know radio from the 1970s you look at the size of the traces on those boards oh yeah they couldn't they couldn't fail like it's uh they were built like tanks except for they were very terrible tanks okay I've got some times yeah so
we have great tanks that are finy is all heck these days I guess if that's if we're continuing John's analogy thanks float plane chat I've got times for you l us we've got times okay what are our times 1 37 and A2 minutes okay PC2 27 minutes PC 3 28 minutes PC 4 35 minutes really yeah oh wow I'm all over the place yeah interesting where are we now Jordan like what is this one uh this is number something 36 what's the timer say oh he's been building it for 6 minutes nope 36 minutes it doesn't count
up no or it just resets immediately pluging in the yeah he's on 6 minutes into the next one I oh my goodness this is um cool I can keep track of that now this is the most challenging build so  now okay I  computer I but will it post am almost certain that the RGB is not hooked up correctly dang it no I don't think they wired together all the RGB for us John mine looked pretty clean I mean I won't deny that it's clean it's just a question of whether it is plugged in oh God these are those stupid ones
that you have to bend off what the the uh graphics card area oh yes the other case I don't want to be down too much on the case because they generously provided it for the stream and it's for charity which is really good but I will say that I appreciated some of the nice to haves that our other case had um okay let's see let's see if my system works oh after I put a GPU in it dang dang nabit these can be a little scary I think for my SEC oh no this is nice this motherboard has this area of the PCB
quite clear but if you look right here there's some surface mount components here and when you bend these out you can knock these off don't ask me how I know all right what do we got for gpus here I got an RTX 470 super oh that's nice to see mine's white all right we've gone uh well your doesn't match your um the visual aesthetic there but hey that's fine it'll it'll output frames just the same it is a bold choice or generate them it's just an absolute showcase that is the other option does the GPU
generate the frames or is that done on the CPU and then the GPU just part I'm calling it The GPU I'm saying it's generated on the GPU all right Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message sure do you think the big difference between AMD and Nvidia is just software Cuda dlss Etc or are Nvidia gpus better even without those things taken into account if anything I would say that price for Price AMD gpus are better um a lot of a lot of the the engineering of a of a GPU these days is pretty well
understood those Folks at both team red and Team Green have been doing things for a very very very long time um and I think that we have seen Generation by generation that on paper AMD will have a lot more performance um in theory but Nvidia finds a way to um to be very very competitive in terms of of real world performance it's also gotten extremely complicated to measure because now we can't just look at you know memory bandwidth and um you know how many shaders it has or whatever else
right like you can't just look at Raw specs uh because especially Nvidia has included um like essentially uh um assist you know co-processors on their gpus that do things like uh help with um AI accelerated upscaling so I I would say I would say AMD generally builds uh a stronger GPU for the price but not out of the goodness of their heart it's because in order to compete they kind of like have to throw more Raw run at the problem would be my assessment okay let's see if we manage
to build a functioning computer here any luck any dice oh my goodness am I 10 minutes over I'm 10 minutes overtime on this one yeah good gravy okay and I'm supposed to talk about LTT store I think it's posting hey didn't it post I'm going to call that time yes 40 40 minutes 30 seconds new guest okay I have a new guest a hey how's it going Tatiana from Creator Warehouse wow you are making progress yeah very slow progress which is good no good job uh you're doing everything right so far so
that's that's better than Dennis here's a for you oh she doesn't have a mic well okay cool well she'll talk in a minute uh okay I was wondering why you were all done up this morning but I was afraid to ask cuz I think you're not supposed to ask oh my God yes it's for viewers yeah okay hey that makes sense we had our merch meeting this morning and uh I was like well you know like um Mark for example you know showed up and like like you know totally done up all nice and you know you you ask uh but I I don't
know I never know what the rules are and I don't want to overstep my bounds so I just did I was like oh okay yeah her hair looks nice today but I didn't say anything um but this makes way more sense now this totally makes sense anyway uh do you want to explain are you mic now yeah your mic now do you want to explain what you do for the uh for the creative Warehouse team and also um get out of my way cuz I need half the table yes sorry get out of my way yeah so I'm the raw materials uh product developer
here at creater Warehouse so I work on a lot of fashion products to make sure that everything is tested and that we have excellent Fabrics that are tried and true and stand the test of time sorry you're good and uh sometimes I work on some engineering products and I also help around with photography and everything else in order to make create a warehouse what it is so one of her first challenges that is now finally coming to Market um I think sometime in the next couple
months yeah yeah was our mod net so I um I I gave her a very difficult task I basically said yeah it needs to be price competitive because I think one of the problems with the existing mod mats on the Market is that they're so expensive that unless you're building computers regularly or commercially uh they don't even really make sense to buy so so many people who are working on projects or building computers can't really absorb that much cost in in the in the cost of their machine so I don't think that
really makes sense but I also came back to her and said well okay so it has the cost has to make sense but do you remember all the things that I that I was like they need to be class leading let's see let's see for fun cuz I you do it because I don't remember well it had to be very easy to oh sorry it had to be uh very easy to clean it had to make sure that no screws would fall off so the tribology and the wear had to be really good in order to capture that kind of friction you're
going to have to defi Define words like tribology she always does this she just drops some technical ass term in the middle of the meeting and I'm like yeah that's that's a word I've never heard before what what oh really yeah explain oh okay um it's the study of wear and friction okay so especially when you're talking about for oh sorry for example bearings or when you're looking at gaskets and stuff you want to make sure that there's enough lubricant in R means it's that the actual texture
on it allows for more friction in order to make sure that nothing will slide off so that was one of the tests to make sure that we had a adequate amount of friction applied and then looking at doing not only internal testing but also third party testing I did a ton in regards to picking the uh blend of rubbers and even the fillers so it actually uses a uh conductive um carbon black in order to make sure that the top is dissipative and that the bottom is conductive that's is so cool I
always forget that like a lot of the people we work with are nerds too and CW has some really cool Specialties almost all of them I know it's awesome it's so cool it's just types of nerdom it's great yeah we're very excited about this product she ended up hitting some stretch targets it is uh extremely burn resistant um so you're you're still going to be able to Market if you try really hard like you know don't expect to be using a blow torch over top of it and hitting it full blast and having it
not Mar at all or whatever the case may be but it is up there with any other um any other product on the market in terms of heat resistance and we also uh managed to find an outstanding print process that gives it a really vibrant but still extremely clear um clear print so that was uh that was one of Tatiana's early tasks that she has managed to bring all the way to market now it'll be launching fairly soon and then there's another one that we're going to have to discuss because it wasn't nearly as much
of a success and has been an ongoing pain point and has actually put some strain on our relationship um because I asked Tatiana to solve once and for all the fact that we don't have socks and she promised do you remember that yes I did she was she was young and naive then yes I was she she promised to find a sock blend and a sock uh what is it it's not a weave is it what's the what's the technal the knit and a sock knit that would meet my exacting standards Y and the only reason I actually bring it up
is because I think I think we're finally getting close oh hopefully hopefully how many samples have you have you brought to oh my God a ridiculous amount of samples ridiculous amount of samples but I don't ask for much I ask for Comfort durability breathability quick drying I want it to look nice I mean really uh affordable yeah yeah I right that's what everyone wants yeah exact right I'm asking for no more than what our customer wants which is the world yep at a good price oh man yeah no it's it's kind of
it's kind of wild the uh the different rabbit holes that you've ended up okay oh okay give me give me another rabbit hole that you ended up at ended up down during your time here that you did not expect oh that I did not expect well you can give me one you expected as long as it's fun too I love all of the different changing materials that we do such as um we're doing some that change when you apply water to it and it reveals something or even some heat changing ones so when you touch it it'll actually
phase change essentially into a different color both product leaks I know okay but Nick it wasn't me it was not me for a change hey you know what I did talk about the um the zip off shorts that I was like oh would anyone actually want this and lo and behold Nick comes to me and he's like you know what everyone in the comments wanted it so I got schooled a little bit and uh we might it might be coming out soon so you know Are you seriously going to do zip poop shorts that would be amazing I
actually love those they're so practical but what do you do with the legs are you doing mix like different colorways cuz you could do mix and match d k i i revealed so much already I got to stop okay well we I should atast I should at least clarify what she's talking about with the um the the water reveal so I'm personally extremely excited about this one I mean do your best impression of the noise that I made when you guys first showed me the fabric samples let's let's hear it and I was
like it was either that or something along those lines it's so cool so do you want to explain how it works it's a fabric that when it gets wet it like reveals a hidden picture essentially so how does that work so essentially it's a clear resist that's applied onto the fabric so therefore wherever the resist is is going to uh not wet or absorb the into the fabric thus not changing the color therefore you're going to see the print when it the parts do get wet and the other parts resist it hopefully
makes sense that's a good I think that's a good explanation what I don't understand necessarily is how that like like wouldn't the wouldn't the water creep in from the side like under the resist or does the resist soak into the fabric so that it just um well resists essentially okay so that's how it works anyway we're doing a bathing suit yes and it is so cool because uh when it gets wet so it it just looks like a solid color when you're still on the beach and then when you get in the water and it gets wet
what did we settle on for the pattern do you remember uh yes well there's going to be two I don't know how much we want to reveal but you are officially the leakiest team member now jeez I can't you know what just just go for it do you remember what either of them are cuz I it actually is escaping me right now the brosaurus and the circuit print okay that's right okay so we're going to have we're going to have a common version of the swim trunks and then we are also going to have a uh
like a special like a shiny um and it's going to be just kind of loot boxes so you'll order the swi the swim trunks and you will either get like a circuit inspired print kind of like our old like water cooling inspired print that we had on our old swim shorts or is it 5% I can't remember I can't remember what the odds are don't quote me on the odds but there are some odds 5% is it 5% oh nice okay uh so there's a 5% chance that when they get wet they will instead reveal bread sorus um so so
excited about that product and then the uh the temperature change one is like a it's like I wouldn't describe it as a puffy jacket um is it a puffy jacket it is a puffy jacket it's a little puffy but it's not like a like a puffer jacket I don't think kind of how would you describe it it kind of is okay well um I would say that it's it's not like your average down jacket but it is going to be a um kind of like a coach's jacket so it's going to be a like a polyester fill so it's not going
to be as warm as it down so it's going to be a really good in between especially for the fall or spring months um anyway the part that's really exciting about that one is uh what do you what do you call like a thermochromic yeah thermochromic so we found a thermochromic material that initially they kind of tried to talk me out of um but you were you were in my camp for this one right oh yeah I love it yeah she was Pro thermochromic so um they tried to talk me out of it and the
reason was that it takes your body heat and it changes color but the challenge with that is that if you have any internal pocketing for instance um you end up with more uh thermal insulation between your body and the jacket right um and between the outer layer of the jacket right because insulation is insulation it works both ways it's kind of it's kind of doing what it's supposed to do if it keeps your body heat in away from the surface where it can be dissipated to the surrounding air yeah
so um because anywhere with extra layers so anywhere where there's a pocket bag or anywhere where there's like extra stitching or whatever is not going to transfer heat as well and is going to end up kind of looking kind of patchy they kind of tried to talk me out of it and honestly I just think it adds to the coolness of the look it's very cool so essentially how it works is that once uh heat is applied the chain structure becomes more flat thus allowing more uh light to pass through making it more
transparent so then you can see the base color so cool so we're we're Tatiana has been been um a big part of us experimenting with like new materials in particular cuz that's kind of her bread and butter but she also does more just like run-of-the-mill stuff as well like uh for instance we were working on uh a t-shirt that we're calling the Zuck and the reason is that it's it's modeled after the t-shirt that Mark Zuckerberg famously wore for years and years and years before you got a stylist um and
one of the things that's a big challenge is getting the hand feel right to match the kind of the quality and the the drape of of a really expensive material because it legitimately is like he wears $400 shirts I don't think I think it could be done for less than $400 which becomes Tatiana's problem um so I forget where I was going with this right so one of the things that Tatiana did recently was cut up a $400 t-shirt yep in order to have the fabric tested um because like she's
really struggling with this PC so sorry I wanted to ask like I'm going to put I'm going to put your bracket on the right way and then um this is the first time I'm doing this yeah yeah no you're doing great have you ever built a computer before no okay you are doing amazing you're doing appreciate it you're probably lying no no I'm not the you have the ram in the correct slots you got the CPU in without busting anything as far as I can tell uh you have the correct standoffs for your like
the correct spacers for your CPU Cooler Mount you're actually doing like outstanding All Things Considered  that you need some help obviously but all things all things considered this is this is great this is great okay so you're going to want to tighten all those down first before you do that and you're going to want to take that fan off of there anyway the point is that we are we're we're trying to we're trying to match it and so uh she has this special little machine I guess
it's technically a machine anything's a machine that does work um so she has this special little machine that Cuts Like A Perfect Circle out of a garment or out of a fabric so that you can measure the exact weight of it which is in what like grams per square something GRS per square meter GSM cutter G per square meter there you go so um by finding that out we are we're basically  oh oh this is whoops oh man this this machine is a lot harder to build in but I'm going to gosh darn it
I'm going to do I'm going to do my best here let's take that off um basically it's part of figuring out why something is good I wouldn't go as far as to say reverse engineering because we're not necessarily targeting the exact same composition or the exact same uh Source because if we were to Target the exact same Source it would probably cost just as much cuz it's like what is it like a particular town in Italy or something where they solatano I believe but I'm not quite sure but a small town in Italy
where everyone is like it's a generational knits and Weavers and everything is able to be traced back however we are looking at the options that we do have in using other European Mills to also have the same kind of ethics and the same kind of practice races just add a much more reasonable price point for our consumers yeah there you go that thing that thing she said okay manage to get the eight pins Plugged In which is going to save me some time later but I'm a little worried
about some of this Cable Management because the last one was kind of a nightmare how much time do I have for this one Jordan 15 I have 15 minutes left you know what I can do it I can do this I think Tatiana is going to do her best I'm to do my best yes that is all that anyone can ask of you um kind of lost now can I help you yes please no problem uh you are going to want to go ahead and put some thermal goop on there let's see let's see how she does let's see how she does cuz I
think as part of uh designing or helping with the design of the modmat she's probably had to look at like thermal goop patterns not really you know what that is a good guess okay that's a good enough guess that um whether what you did is necessary or not it's not going to harm anything and that will work fine I know there's an x pattern I know there's a lot of different patterns I know a lot of people just do the one line I don't know I just free did it I guess yep you know what that's uh that's
totally valid and you're you're you're going to you're going to get away with one on that okay I what I need to do because I'm actually trying to get this computer done in a in a shorter time than the last one I built is I need to pre run a couple of these things that don't fit through this Gap once I put the power supply in so let's get our front panel audio in here Dan do you want to hit me with a merch message absolutely I just got a visitor here oh you have a visitor oh hey look

uh you're going to want to take this fan off oh okay and then you need to screw down through here to to screw this to the plate there cuz right now it's just you know yeah like that um and also just it doesn't matter but it would mean a lot to me if you'd have the noctua ight okay it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't affect performance it's just it's one of those things yeah yeahh decide be pleased this Punch If you could if you could do that I should do a what now leak some more stuff leak
some more stuff yeah Tatiana leaked all the stuff yeah that's okay I'm a Tatiana tail I actually like a oh wow for now yeah for now we done a lot of screwdrivers hey let's go let's go oh man okay what else am I supposed to be doing am I do you have any of the things for me or anything or like one do we have a guessing game thing we can guess some stuff I got a merch message in the meantime if you fancy I'm getting a little frazzled here at this  behind yes oh okay hi from Switzerland
thanks for all of the great content my friends at University about the other content you're not going to thank me for that why would they I grew up with LTT we share this love for Tech thanks to y'all we wonder what your utility bills  like how do I say this without sounding completely like deranged levels of out of touch I have no idea I have not looked at a utility bill in my adult life I'm going to message cedo um yeah cedo would know uh yeah I went straight from my parents paying my utility bill to my
wife paying my utility bill so I legitimately have never I've never so much as seen one um I don't know probably not good because we have people who work from home and they cannot possibly be expected to like put their computer to sleep only when they need only when they're knock going to need to wake it the next day to remote into it or whatever else and stuff so basically all like 100 machines in this building are just on all the time uh just just like our idle power consumption is probably
ridiculous um cedo is getting it for us yeah I don't know what to I don't know what to tell you guys other than that it's probably horrible and that is in spite of us being in a part of the world that has um very very favorable energy costs I mean  last don't worry about it we've been doing nothing to nobody there's no pie only cake yep um any who uh let's change the subject really quick here Dan oh sorry which ones am I supposed to start out oh yeah yeah yeah um okay so you got
to start by taking that fan off okay sorry I feel so bad no no you didn't great so uh here I can if you'd like I can show you how to do it thank you um okay so you pull this back here okay you weren't looking where you I was yes pull this back here hold then this don't touch the thermal goop cuz it's going to it makes such a mess I hate getting it on my hands it takes forever to clean um I feel so bad no no you're doing great this is the more challenging of the two computers so you would have had probably
an easier time if you'd done the other one they really they really threw you to the wolves on this great love it oh I okay then I assume this is like this yeah but the knock to our right side up no I'm kidding I'm kidding it's right no no it was right it was right I'm I'm just being unhelpful you why are you doing this to me I don't know you probably had it coming for some reason let's look back in time for a second I always do probably something let me think um well okay maybe uh maybe how
you failed me for the last time Commando when it comes to socks no I'm in all seriousness though the latest sample is very promising very very promising super quick drying oh yeah right I forgot one of the other things that I told you it couldn't do is shed yes yep yep I really didn't ask for much tell us another cool project what do you what do you I mean you've already leaked everything that's upcoming so what was something that you did in the past other than this uh in the past that I've done other than
this I mean super soft worked on and that was a lot of fun oh yeah that hoodie is doing really well the super soft hoodie on the store is I mean like it's right in the name it's super soft um what did you do for that uh so I mean I do everything in regards to testing to make sure that it uh has a really good dimensional stability to wash I do everything in regards to color fastness to make sure that you don't see any color transfer when you wear it stuff like that even for a lot of the reorders
making sure that it um is relatively the same so a lot of the testing that I do also mimics is trying its best to mimic the real world environments that it's in so pilling we do as much as we can while also being very very soft all that stuff oh that's a fun one uh so I had you I had you mimic the uh the sound that I made when I first saw um what was it I think the oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the water the water color change materials can you tell us the sound you made when you saw saw the me get
validated by project farm with his washing methodology for our t-shirt oh my God the whole fashion team we were all just like what do you mean that you threw them all in the wash all at the same time just randomly on a high heat  me see I've told them for years that one like one of the things that I'm always riding the fashion team about is um uh what What's the uh uh shrink um shrinkage dimensional stability to wash yeah and uh and they're always like well it's not really a problem if people take
care of their garments properly and I'm like they won't you have to understand our customer is not going to and so I'm always getting this push back on like well as long as we provide really clear as as long as we provide really clear uh care instructions then it should be fine and you know it shouldn't a huge problem like no they're just going to hu them in the washing machine and then they're just going to hu them in the dryer and so when Todd did his test and uploaded
his video I immediately CCD the entire fashion te and I was like see we have to be ready for that everything that we did led us up to this moment when we were the highest overall rated t-shirt in Todd's test and if we hadn't if we hadn't had our super low shrinkage we wouldn't have won it's true all right I've got a monthly power bill here for you oh no do you want to take a guess uh man I feel like this is going to be like Lucine Lucille blof uh guessing at the price much power cost
$1.2 million yeah um per month I honestly just have absolutely no idea  "$2,800 a" month uh okay you gotta you got to go to Dan go to Dan get the it's just under five grand what but that also includes gas what what do you mean it includes gas what gas for the shop probably for the shop what gas do they use what gas Alla oh like natural gas oh we use almost no natural gas we have that one radiant tube left and we hardly ever we hardly ever touch it because it's it's loud um well it's not loud there's a fan
next to it that is loud because otherwise it just heats the one side and it doesn't blow any of the heat anywhere else way way cheaper than I was expecting really well we're in BC so like well absolutely it is a place that has very very inexpensive power relative to most of the world but uh and we have a lot of power hungry stuff five grand a month huh jeez that's like a whole employee if we just didn't use any electricity we could hire like an assistant for Tatiana think of it
what do you think should we stop using electricity we'll just switch to paper and pencil candle light oh God candle yeah I'm down would could you find us the best candles that have the optimal like light throw to oh yeah we would be measuring the luminesence we'd be doing all that oh of course can I get like a 5500 Kelvin candle like Andrew Andrew would kill us do that yeah we need like a lighter blue candle otherwise the lighting for the cameras that we have to charge outside are going to be like
pretty bad um all right how do I not about this two minutes I guess it kind of makes sense cuz I didn't I never asked anybody um actually that's not true I have asked yvon before but she wasn't sure either uh it's it's been uh it's been on the accounting team to sort these things out  all right don't think about it don't about it yeah that's probably the safest thing realistically jeez man think about how many computers you have going on yeah look at all these computers we're building for charity Isn't that
cool won't be paying my power bills with them we're going to be feeding this the the the the the people they we're going to be donating we our plan is a local food bank we haven't figured out exactly which one I don't think yet um Jordan just told me the plan is a local food bank cuz it seems like the right thing to do this time of year okay let's go ahead and get my power supply plugged in how are you doing over there I'm trying I'm trying my best you are very trying no I no no I'm kidding I'm kidding it
was just you walked right into it you walked right into it I had to I know I did I really did I had to take the bait I'm sorry I don't actually mean that anyway the the point is um Okay one minute shoot um okay you need to turn this fan around the other I do okay uh yeah um yeah you can move that one too and that one is going to be more work to move because you need to um put the metal bracket on the other way on the other way okay I'm sorry you're no it's fine you know what considering that you have
have had only half an hour you have made excellent progress for first time Builder so what made you volunteer for this if You' never built a computer before I told Jordan I was like I've never really done this before are you sure he's like yeah we're going to have different skill levels I'm like okay I'm down but I then I saw that it was timed and I'm like I do not do very good things under pressure so I'm like everyone in the comments is probably saying who is this girl and why does she
not know anything I'm going to be like I'm sorry no no she knows lots of stuff just not about this you're doing better than Dennis and that's okay um yeah yeah you've gotten less done but you've also gotten less done incorrectly okay so like he got more done but a lot of it was wrong I would say I would say doing less right is better than doing more wrong so this way in general like it's I don't know yeah yeah it's better to do it's better to do a little bit right okay and taana there
should be some hot glue in the Box to just kind of tack it on hot hot glue okay what are we talking about was I supposed to need hot glue for something I have not used any hot glue uh is no one going to clarify that for me or no I'm just on my own okay that may be what you called a joke oh is joke and you're out of time by the way I am doing just fine for time I am almost done where did I put my screws for this power supply there they are 1 two 3 four okay so what was um I guess you don't
have a time what was my time for the last last one the last one in this case the last one was 40 minutes and 30 seconds dude I'm going to be so far under that on this one I got this okay it's time for oh no I haven't done the GPU yet oh for crying out loud is Nick starting now oh more Head Start starts I really shouldn't have let myself fall behind at the very beginning that that was my mistake today to be fair I did delay us an hour you did a what now I delayed us an hour well no I mean it
wasn't your fault that the internet went out at the building unless it was your fault in which case bad Dan uh might have been his fault don't actually know for sure that it wasn't no not my fault it wasn't you okay I think it was my fault that the rest of the company was down for about  cool oh man this whole time I I had this concept of that I would have my laptop for chat and then I accidentally knocked my laptop off a desk earlier and then I haven't had I haven't had any any chat
I've had no idea what's going on are people even enjoying this Dan yeah they seem to be uh like they can't believe it's been still entertaining after three or so hours um tell taana she's doing a great job oh my God who is this girl and why can't she be on more LOL Get Wrecked Dennis she is on more you just have to subscribe to float plane Tatiana's actually had uh you did did a couple exclusives I think on float plane uh what was the one you did by yourself the oh the backpack mining mining backpack
I've done I've also done a deep dive into how we test for materials so that one I had also done if anyone wants to also see me say that you have to follow the care instructions then I get roasted in the comments saying we're not going to follow it anyway so I'm like well okay suits yourself you don't have to but if you want the long longevity of your clothes you probably should every time I see lectured by taana if that's your thing then feel free to subscribe to float plane uh you were
also heavily involved in the one where we uh we all tried out and talked about the $400 Zuckerberg t-shirt yeah the branell Cinelli Y and then also the uh teeth boots if you've seen that if you have no idea what you're talking about go check it out essentially we 3D print some fangs onto a shoe and we get to use a lot of the equipment around the office and labs and to do so so that was super fun and we have some fun upcoming ones too oh are you in some more exclusives
that are coming up yeah oh are you going to are you going to leak them like you leak everything no this one I can't oh really this one I can't oh interesting cuz I think there's some people who would be very upset if I did oh okay are their names Sammy uh no oh okay so this is like very top secret do I even know about this no you don't and that's all I'll say oh I'm not going to say anymore oh good I love surprises especially surprises like I don't know if this um 4070 super is actually going to fit in this
case um oh boy um huh well this is fun wait no way no way hold on okay hold on no no I want you guys to I want you guys to be there with me for the adventure so I'm coming around so you can see here we go we're going to get this we're going to get this in here oh my gosh this may be the tightest GPU fit that I have ever seen there we go we are here hold on here let me find  friction fits between this GPU and the   is hilarious all right cool let's get this power plugged in and then let's 
posts I know uh this one can go on this side and these clips they go on the far end yeah no you're doing you're doing great okay chat chat's getting antsy uh which one of you two is taller oh I guess they're getting back to back huh they will not stop okay oh not by much I am not you want your stilts back buddy I got those teeth boots okay well which one is it are you guys going to settle this stand here forever it's you it's me yes I won for once it's your shoes yeah I think you wear higher shoes
than me Madam well in general yeah I've seen I've seen some high shoot someone just turn this on yep I haven't screwed   sure oh man okay sure jeez jeez yeah we we have we have we have fun here have fun here have fun here when did that become a super toxic thing to say was it always hey dude I am is this number six am I six for six six for six oh wait no wait yeah yes two more i' it's kind of turning into a blur not going to lie um all my RGB on okay yeah that one was quite a bit faster okay 36 minutes 30
seconds 36 minutes all right and bc7 go go go go go I tried yeah all right all right see you next nice job all right good stuff should we go through some merch messages while we switch over wait did you take my did did did you did you take this no I just moved it I just moved it moved it and put your fan on okay I'm sorry no I was just wondering where my screw tray went I was I was using the power supply packaging as a screw tray uh anyway all right thanks Tatiana okay bye all
right it's Nick what up big dog so I saw some speculation that there was no way that I could actually have been cruel enough to Blindside you with that secret shopping LTT store.com video no you're there was there was no way I could have possibly been that cruel all fake totally fake what would you what would you have to say to to that accusation he's crer than you know no it was that was uh not the way I wanted to spend what was that a Friday afternoon I will say so thanks for that
um man I think it turned out okay it wasn't perfect I thought that I thought that we came out looking overall like we have our heart in the right place and like we are improving and like we are committed to almost an unhealthy degree to trans parency yep I think that is a fair assessment and based on how sales are going for the store this Black Friday Cyber Monday I'd say people overall have pretty high faith in the team and the store I agree um but no it was absolutely real if you
guys didn't see it we did a video recently secret shopping my own store I think is the title or something along those lines I paid people to secret shop my store something yeah yeah you can you can tell that it's burn turned into his memory um I do a lot of videos I don't know I forget some of them but the point is that um Nick got brought onto set had no idea what was going on they're literally like don't look at the script don't look at the script like all right don't look at the
teleprompter and watch his team get an honest third-party review from a handful of of our of our of our community members who I think really took the task very seriously I think so I mean I think there was even some feedback where people were like oh this person was too harsh and it's like no that was like their job yes they were supposed to be harsh yes they were harsh they were that's why we asked them to be a part of it right and in order to keep ourselves honest we went out of our way to choose
members of the community that would have a strong voice within the community if we were anything other than completely honest and transparent and uh and and high integrity about the whole situation cuz we could have easily secret shopped our store by just hiring someone to secret shop it and then provided us with the results privately that would have totally been a thing that we could do but it wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining yeah I don't think this made the cut but like three or four
times throughout the entire video he was like you know what this would be stressful but I'm just having fun watching you squirm and I was like cool that feels good it was fun well the thing is I knew about the concept but I didn't actually know any of the results either so I was sitting there like super stressed as well but it just his reactions were just so fun oh I couldn't help it it was so good we have fun here yeah we yeah we yeah we have fun here um all right Jordan what
am I supposed to be doing am I supposed to guess anything are we playing any guessing games way behind well yeah hit me you got to interrupt and let me know I'm sitting here stalling for time half the time you're falling behind most I I  minutes all right here we go don't worry about it don't worry about it who's who's counting who's count I'm counting you asked me to count all right let's uh getting your way back machine here 2014 2015 which number is this uh number s then all righty should I throw it up
bless sure there you go oh well that's kind of an easy one guess what video that was that was our 4K gaming PC build guide so that would have been our that would have been our top viewed video that year yeah 2.1 million build guides what year was it uh 20 I've already forgotten 145 so do you think you made that thumbnail or do you think I made that thumbnail oh put it back up again let me see it was made in paint.net and we had like a standard process I believe I did that one yeah okay yeah I'm pretty sure
I did that one uh we didn't have like any actual people who know how to use Photoshop or anything that's just like uh there's this oh man there's this site something vandermoten something where you can download a drop shadow plugin for paint.net y and I just had like a like a standard offset and standard blur and I would just put text on top of a screen grab from the video which was like kind of fine because by then Brandon was working here and doing nice b-roll for our videos uh and that was it
that was that was our thumbnail design we actually continued to use that for the W show up until I guess a number of months back I actually remade this exact paint.net look in Photoshop amazing so that it could stay consistent nice uh and it's way more templ now so it's easier to do rather than having to do all of it manually every single thumbnail and the reason the L show um was done like that up until basically now was because we never decided on a title and thumbnail concept until right
as we were about to go live and by then we couldn't count on anyone other than me to be in office um until now we have a producer for the show finally um so so it had to be something that I could do and with all the other stuff I have going on I'm not going to learn Photoshop anytime soon so well now it's a template so you don't even have to you just drop in a thumbnail and then type in the text and you're done Dan you know for a fact you know for a fact that if I had to do it again for some reason I
would use paint.net there would be probably a bigger problem if you ever had to do it yeah probably it could come up though you never know that's true you never know are you looking at my homework yeah are you cheating yeah okay when do you think the last time I built a PC was like myself probably your gaming PC so what was that oh good lord hold on is that well the last gaming PC that I built or the last the the gaming PC I have now is a 39 50 60x 3900x 3900 X yeah and I didn't
build it okay but before that it would you had a fourth or six1 I had uh third gen third gen Intel okay did Luke build that for you or did you build that I think Luke built that for us oh boy and so I I I think the last time I built a PC from start to finish was like second gen Intel okay so then this will be a great test because for many years Nick had to as part of his job watch all of our videos because he would review them for things like um if I said some kind of joke that was too far over the
line or you know whatever else then which happens he would come and be like you shouldn't say that can't say that I'd be like how dare you question my authority okay Mom how dare you question my authority anyway sorry go on um I'm interrupting so what we're going to find out is as someone who has watched all the build guides um probably not that 4K one I think that predates you um but as someone who has watched basically all the build guides how useful are they will he be a PC Building expert uh
should we do another I put my ram in the right slot a couple shouts off the board sure it is amazing what a draw like 4K was as a as a keyword supposed to tighten these down yet no like if I did 4K gaming PC yeah if I did you know 4K gaming PC Today people'll be like yeah so you mean like a gaming PC you know it's no one cares and build guides man build guides every once in a while those videos will perform like pretty good like I think the the first person view one that we did recently is finally
picking up but it started out as like the worst performer that we'd uploaded in months uh it's man it's really tough even the um the last guide you'll ever need series it's a series now I guess cuz we did that second one um man that when we uploaded or the updated one like no one was watching it it's tough because somehow we've got to make it so that every video or at least as many videos as possible are appealing both to the folks who have been watching us since those videos that we're showing
you guys and the folks who are tuning in for the first time and have never built a computer that is an extremely difficult line to straddle um making it accessible to newcomers and also not completely boring to the folks who've been doing this for a long time it's not that we don't want to do more basic PC tutorials and stuff it's just that people give us a really hard time when we do them it's like yeah who doesn't know that it's just building Legos like no it's not some people have
never built Lego before okay you talk a "lot huh Lego bricks don't cost $4,000" where's my job some of them do that's a whole kit like one brick that's fair uh all right Jordan do you want to give us another one uh you're going to do some shout outs here oh shout outs right oh yeah uh now is a good time to shout out patriot who sent over eight kits of RAM for our builds here oh no I'll steal mine um what am I what am I looking at here these are DDR five kits 5600 megat transfers per second CL 36 uh
16 gig by 2 so these are 32 gig kits for our intel-based systems over here big shout out to them and everyone else Who provided parts for the stream today they are a big part of why we're able to contribute so much to the local food bank that we will be donating the proceeds from these systems too we've already sold all the systems so if you're were hoping to buy one I'm afraid it is too late but uh huge thank you to everyone who did buy one of the systems and huge thank you to everyone who
provided hardware for them so I'm shouting out Patriot and also seic seic you know that those guys are always in when we're doing something cool something wild and seic didn't hesitate to send over six de of their focus GX 750 power supplies 80 plus gold certified modular interface got all the modern connectors for modern gpus be they AMD be they Nvidia and a great foundation for any gaming system thank you seic for sending all of those over all right let me get this out of my way
get this out of my way um Jordan do you have any other stuff that I'm behind on oh yeah all right let's uh go 2015 2016 top video what do you think okay top video 2015 you might be able to remember these ones now we're getting more modern I think I know what 2017 was I'm going to go with another build guide I'm going to guess it's a build guide I'm going to say it was a silent PC build guide I don't think this was silent this one's eight okay what am I at do I get to see a thumbnail no oh have another
guess have another guess it's not silent it's extremely not silent there is a build involved though extremely not silent many monies build is involved lots of money any oh I think I know what it is wait are we already up to Gamers no that can't be right no yeah it can't be no extremely not silent okay you you guess that is it the first compensator no oh no that was later I don't know it might have been extreme like maybe that's a bit hyperbolic oh okay it's not a silent
build that's for sure not a silent build but it's a build it's a build yep dude I do not know our bat catalog as well as I maybe thought that I did shall I uh shall I show them yeah show me show me the thumbnail show me the thumbnail were you were right wait it was seven Gamers seven Gamers really I thought that was 2017 that was what I was going to guess for 2017 really quiet that was water cool knew it was January I thought it was jary 2017 the "$30,000 gaming PC seven gamers1 that was"
like the first video to ever get to a million views in like a day in 24 hours it was the first one to do that and you know what's funny I had to as soon as that video was done it had to be at CES so I had to drive I forgot about that I had to drive the exploitive work vehicle that we had at the time which was a Suzuki blue Suzuki XL7 I think I forgot about that it was so bad okay another story with that do you remember when I almost died on the Coca Hala because I took that thing up when my
Grandpa died to his like funeral and it was white out and the headlights were misaligned so I was literally in the left lane and the only way I stayed alive on the drive was that I I could see the barrier so I was three and 1 half hours White Knuckle on the exploitive caala highway with not a good Highway with in the winter headlamps going this way just like anyway that's another story um I think that was the year after or something but um this time around I had to drive that thing with the seven
Gamers one CPU with all seven monitors which all barely barely fit Tetris style into that Suzuki down 4 and 1 half hours or something to the middle of um nowhere Washington to do you remember who brought it with to CS for us wait someone did us like a huge solid do you remember who it was Kingston well they were the ones who exhibited it oh no it was Bob and Rod so I had to drive it down to Bob and cuz they were driving to Vegas BS mods so like 2 days before I drive this thing
down to Washington meet up with BS mods drop off this crazy I think it was in a Server Chassis wasn't it and there is no way that you declared that properly when you crossed the no no no I got hassled on the way back well cuz I had to did I have to bring it back no I got hassled on the way down cuz the guy was like "what do you do you have like $30,000 of" computer components you're like importing these and I was like no no no no no it's just there for like an exib and they somehow let me in so that was a
thing we have gotten very very many times so that was like a 9h hour like car trip um why did it fall on you to do this again I don't remember well I was probably heading down to the show nobody else wanted to do it basically I think so I was like all right should be fun that's just the stuff we did back in the day man like oh man um I forgot about that stupid XL7 dude what a what a that's so it was my parents SUV oh yeah it was it was I'm sure it was a nice car at some some point not when we had it
yeah it was not it was better than literally nothing which is was what we had before that which truly it was better than what we had before do you remember how it hooked up to the um to the running lights for our trailer that we had at the time it just had that like just like a Jank connector just had that wire just like hanging out the back and it was like you just hoped it hadn't corroded so much that you couldn't put it on anymore every time it was so bad um I'm falling super behind we do things
like So Pro Now by comp 2016 17 then you guys 2016 2017 so I'm going to go with I'm going to go with mineral oh wait no mineral oil PC was way before that yeah no no no that was 2015 dude what is even time I'm having a really hard time what years 2016 2017 Y and I'll I'll give you this the video came out August of 2017 in August August of 2017 November to  was it eight Gamers no no that one didn't do that well really that's why we haven't really continued the concept yeah that's true this one got uh 5.6
million views in the first year was it the blowy matron who no no this would have to be like uh this would have to be like a like a mega Banger video to do five million views yeah but I thought the blaton did like remember when you guys hooked it up in the conference room yeah no that did like that did like three or four yeah that one did pretty good but five million views in the first  201 I don't even know I don't even know what what is time yeah yeah what it's a flat circle so number nine then okay
show me show me uh you're going to be upset yeah okay what is it 16k gaming with all the monitors of course it was L that is a banger thumbnail like I don't even think it's that good of a video by today's standards like it's kind of all over the place narratively it's it's not very information dense um I I'm I'm not convinced that you know the whole higher and higher resolution gaming thing um would have any legs today but yeah that was an absolute Banger and it goes to show you how the
the race to more KS mattered so much back then like people cared and we're talking about it two of our of our top performers of the Year videos have been gaming with some number of KS and in fact I think we had an 8K gaming one that would have probably been close to some of these it was like second or third one of the years with um what what was that that was with 4 1080p monitors and then tiling across them or something like that yeah so the next year then is a build so 2017 18 okay are we not are
have we not kept up with these that much we're way behind on these oh my goodness okay okay yeah next time just interrupt just interrupt me cuz I really am a lot of the time you've been doing lots of things stalling for time just talking yes 178 okay okay 2017 2018 6.4 million views now we're getting into like modern era um and I'll tell you it's a build  build this is tough because I um is that how many videos are we up to like total "this will be 6,000 or something" something like that this is 10th year
yeah the number the number of times these days that I someone will send me a clip or a gif or a link to a video and I watch it and I go fever dream I have no recollection of this whatsoever that's cuz we were sending you around the world like on a moment's notice dud I it was so ridiculous those were those were crazy years it's a miracle I can remember like any of was happening do you remember the time you went to the New York show I do that was the worst I remember that very vividly was the worst
I literally found out right as we were going to the airport to come home from CES which is a very challenging week at the best of times and back when I used to make that many videos during CES it was it was crazy I was basically Walking Dead during CES um so I I got an offer from Ford it's the other way to come do like some sponsored content for them at the New York struggling with this fan and um what am I doing I'm on the hand the other way yeah okay so it goes like yeah yeah okay I
had okay and then you just stretch it and then Under and Over Under And yeah yeah yeah yeah just like that I just wonky so they they they wanted me to come down there to go to New York and do some sponsored content I was like okay when and they go next week whatever yeah and I kind of go what so we we waffled and waffled and waffled and things were things were tough back then um you know like we were basically every opportunity that came in I was looking at it going okay well like how much salaries does it
cover you know um and it was it was just Instagram I think like we only had to post like they didn't even post it uh no no that that's a whole other thing we posted our stuff but it was just like a couple Instagram post we didn't even have that many followers on Instagram I was like are you sure you don't want like a YouTube video or something they're like no no Instagram okay um so anyway so I like how you didn't even notice what I'm using I had to oh chat noticed oh Birch messages noticed we can
talk a little bit later about how that is not happening yet you're in your last minute here lonus so you maybe you don't have updates but it's like we're working on it okay well we can talk about that later but anyway um so they they want us to go and do this and um it turned out that the way the trip had to work was was for me to land in Vancouver I ate one meal with my family um and then I stayed at the airport for a couple hours and boarded my flight to New York you didn't even
leave the airport no I never I never left the airport there was no SOB there were it was so so stupid so dumb um but hey I met hey you're welcome yeah yeah the video we're talking about is actually a travel video what wait what sorry what with that many views how many views 6.4 million in the first year traveling and building traveling and building oh was that strange Parts Vlog let's go strange Parts Vlog yep yep that was a banger that was a banger video I don't know why it was a banger
video I was in such rough shape I was over there for a thing for OnePlus and I arranged literally introduced myself to Scotty who I'd never interacted with before only knew from talking about his wild iPhone experiments on the W show so introduced myself to Scotty invited myself to do a collab with him um we coordinated a time to get together and uh basically I came up with this concept for the build which was that I was going to try to build a PC in China using all like you know Brands I'd never heard of
and then I got over there and I saw a lot of comments on the video that I was like such a jerk to Scotty the truth is that I was just really stressed out because what I realized partway into the build was that there were no weird brands or anything it was just all the same stuff so I was just building a PC building a computer and uh it ended up taking all day because I wasted a bunch of time trying to find like a unique angle to the build or something and there ultimately wasn't one and so you
can actually tell at the end of the video that I'm like in a Public Square at night finish ing building the computer because the mall was like closed you help me drop this in I just don't want to screw it up oops thanks um here yeah yeah sure I uh anyway the point is uh yeah Scotty was um an amazing host uh we had a lot of fun and uh we can't do this yet because there's no way that these eight pins are going to get plugged in if you put it all the way in first it's better to do this now and uh more you know
yeah I was just super stressed because I really needed to get a video done I didn't want to go all the way there and like waste his time and not even like do a video together um and I just didn't think that I didn't think there was going to be a video and then it became the biggest video of the year and then it became the biggest video of the year who can even hilarious who can even tell sometimes like what's going to resonate with people um there was another collab I was supposed to do while I was over
there that I am ultimately really glad that I didn't do um but yeah Scotty the Scotty collab was uh was pretty great a lot of fun um well sort of fun it was fun when it was over and uh you guys liked it that was the fun part everything else was actually not really fun about making that video uh oh I would plug in your oh dang it Nick sorry I would plug in your CPU Cooler too all right where is it ah ouch Dam sorry sometimes my elbow does that oh you're good um so your next one was not a build
okay was this 2018 189 20189 7.3 million views recent 7.3 18 19 more of a review I would say a review that got 7 million views what kind of review gets 7 million views had to be in you tell me you made it I mean had to be in video right um had to be like some kind of like really like wacky product or something well November 18 to November 19 we're talking yes yeah this was from December  20188 review that can't be in video no you're over your time by the way you want to
finish here we can move on to the next one oh sorry um no let's not let him Escape before he tells us more about the transparent screwdriver that's true uh you know what I give up I don't even know what the point of me trying to guess these is because I have 280 tie yep it's a uh Walmart gaming PC Walmart gaming PC was that that long ago yeah man end of 2018 what you might be getting old oh man that was six years ago yep okay I can tell you the next year already I'm pretty sure that was the wish you're
correct wish PC okay M okay I'm back on what's the next one I'm back on track after the wish PC am I supposed to keep just leave it uh you can keep going until he's done and then he'll move over and build the  victim nope it's not happening all right no sneeze I guess I don't get a sneeze um no sneeze for you was it Rog rig reboot uh no but it is like a upgrade kind of thing an upgrade was it the first extreme upgrade oh yeah and was it was it an Intel extreme upgrade yep Dennis okay
Dennis's Intel extreme upgrade yeah I'm not going to screw anything more up dud that has like 9 million views or something stupid like that or does it no I don't think it does 66 I think was the first year both 6 million in the first year that's crazy like one of my okay hold on Nick before you go away show us the screwdriver you were building with and explain yourself what what's going on here sir this is our clear transparent screwdriver hypothetical LTT store.com it's a lot of sunk dollars if
we don't actually make it um so we've had a lot of challenges making this clear plastic work uh for one we started with a different type of clear plastic got further in development and then realized that it wasn't going to be suitable for all of the scenarios that we needed to be suitable for so instead of just being like ah screw it it'll be fine we decided nope we have to go back to the drawing board and make it work um we've had some small difficulties with getting it across the line I'm trying to
even see where the imperfection Here We Go There It Is so if you can zoom in on that Andy that little Mark there is the reason that the clear screwdriver is not on the market today Kyle has another thing that he doesn't like about it too I can show them oh okay yeah so basically we're having some challenges with the mold flow of the Plastics within the molds that we use today cuz there are crossover molds between what we use in our regular ABS nylon blend for the black and all the other colors
just SC drivers that we make uh as well as this clear and it's required quite a bit of mold development to actually make that work we are very very close so that line is caused by the plastic separating and then coming together well it's that it starts to cool a little bit as it's coming together so you see that seam whereas if it's total molten plastic it'll just meld together if it's coming together and cooling at the same time then you get what they call a weld line um which is where the two two paths to
plastic meet together um small things but that's the level of detail we want to go to and that's the level of detail that we understand that our expect our uh customers have come to expect from us For Better or For Worse um and honestly sometimes it's a big part of the reason that you guys don't get more products that you would probably mostly really like because we just look at it and we go like well if we can't do it great then we're just not going to do it and we're getting better we're getting
better at our product development timelines we're getting better at tracking the process throughout we're getting better at planning these things and and I think as you come into 2025 2026 especially in 2027 it's going to be like a very well oiled machine it's just taking us some time to get there the business has grown in a really uneven way like for a while we were a water bottle company yeah and then we were a desk Pad Company and first we were a t-shirt company and then we weren't sure
what we were doing t-shirt and then we we bet we basically took everything and more bet it on black and bet it hard black screwdrivers and black backpacks on the screwdriver and the backpack and then we had all this Revenue like like we had an incredible year like the kind of year that you have as a company and you just go well there's no point trying to beat this um and then we were just kind of trying to you still try figure out yeah trying to figure out okay well like no
seriously okay we can't just we can't just ride these products forever how do how do we what's the next step you know what investing in new people investing in New processes investing in new equipment like there's a whole reason that we have I don't know let's call it low six figures of prototyping equipment that the engineering team uses between SLS printers SLA printers ton of standard printers um don't forget we have our old Tatiana's toys she was just here we have our own injection molder
that we are learning to use we have you know uh what is it called the C is it CMM like the super precise measurement tool that we bought nothing super cool we should probably do another video about like maybe a float plane exclusive yeah um but yeah we have a lot of really cool stuff that allows us to get better at our product development now and we're working on processes that'll make us better as a product development company and just want to deliver the best we can
for you guys and the best way to support that you know what I'm going here comes the pitch yeah yeah yeah I'm trying to plug something in going is to buy some Black Friday stuff yeah because if we sell more on Black Friday the best way to support that is to wait until black Friday's over and buy stuff at regular yeah no no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding also you want to get a good deal and support that then you should buy dur Black Friday yes and for those who are asking yes we have mod
mats coming soon they should be out next month um yes we have Precision bit sets coming back soon that was just well beyond any expectation that we could ever have when we launched with that um I think we had assumed hey probably half the people are going to want to buy a bit set cuz most everybody's going to have a bit set and they just want to have like a cool driver that's an upgrade with the hybrid ceramic bearing and the bit starage it's so cool and like that's cool and then you were all
like forget the nice build quality and you were all like give me the bit set too and then we were like okay now we don't have anymore so it takes time it takes time and when you're making when you're making your own products but like actually making your own products yeah you can't just like it's not just like oh it'll be ready in a week more it's like oh it'll be ready in 60 days because here's the thing oh hey this one shipping dude I am seven for seven today let's go seven seven luses one PC and at
the volume the volume that we're producing things 3333 3333 I was giving this guy a hard time um about not having uh bit sets for the regular screwdriver and stuff and I was like well like come on how could it take that long to get this there was a particular one and Nick's like okay well let me put it this way every pack is how many is in a pack six 12 12 12 every pack is 12 bits okay "so you want to order 20,000 packs so" that's a quarter million qu million things you're right
whatever the point is just like to make this is nothing yeah to make it a quarter million times like you can't y like we're we're in a really weird in between where we're too small to like have our own Factory but we're too big to necessarily just like you know have someone be like oh yeah I'll slip you in between my other orders and to be fair most of the companies that you would think are big enough to have their own Factory likely don't yeah they just have better negotiating power stronger relationships
you know uh preferential treatment online Time stuff like having you know their own they own their own production to some extent yes um but we're getting better I mean we've made a lot of changes over the last year and a half and bringing in new people who have a lot of expertise in areas that we didn't before and just takes time we're getting better we're implementing these processes good progress you actually did not too bad I think middle of the road middle of the road well we got
distracted talking about you know Suzuki XL7 bidness all right time for my last build partner hi are you going to carry this last one cuz I'm tired um I don't know about that I don't think I've built enough computers to carry this I can carry you uh oh what are you doing over here well what do you mean uh you're going to want to put your CPU on the motherboard and stuff before you put the motherboard in the case why um cuz it's going to be well I mean yeah actually you know what what whatever
you'd like I like your hair it looks nice have it um L should we start banging off some merch messages here we got a bunch to get through let me get completely caught up on Jordan stuff and absolutely let's let's get some merch messages going I think this is all Ivon stuff I'm finally on the last system uh before I do that I took this bit away where did what screwdriver did I take this bit out of whoa it was already on the table it was already on the table it might be from mine that Deon has uh okay
well it's wait what um okay sure is it a small hex it's no oh man I can tell  deodorant today burn everyone else is played enough to say nothing but no no not my wife um no it's fine probably had it coming that we have an honest and open relationship yes yes no matter what no matter what yes say you have an open  interesting I mean this is good to know um I don't what's up what's up 1% I don't think it'll matter if you don't even wear deodorant a very good point yeah I'll be lucky to get be
getting any from like people who have to contractually um actually that isn't in the marriage contract is it no it's not rats they really should fix that okay what are we talking about all right Jordan you were going to hit me with some more guess which was the video you got three left here okay all right you got to remember these ones it's pretty recent okay so we have uh 2021 and 22 yeah uh 6.4 million views from February of 22 February of 22 uh that's all you're giving me that's all I'm going to give
you right now um there's a brand in the title there's a brand in the title oh maybe it's another like all something build oh one of them did like crazy numbers is it the all Rog build no sir all aorus build no is it a stream no oh I don't know then I don't know I'm so I'm so fried at this GPU what is it it's about a GPU it's about a GPU Oh I thought Dan was giving me a hint he's just showing me a live feed of myself right now show you your fail oh okay um about a GPU can I interrupt your train of
thought I mean sure who cares at this point there's barely a trade at this point what kind of build is is this is this the kind of build where we're  like look I I've been through all of them with him so I just need to know someone bought it for $600 okay okay I'm putting in every screw it is actually going to ship to an actual customer okay um and and what's cool is the parts were actually donated uh I think our last shout out is for thermal take and colorful uh thermal
sent over eight cases and colorful sent over a couple of gpus uh which were the colorful GP I they were the last couple 7800s you had the last couple 7800s so 7800 XTS incredibly generous everyone who contributed Parts because we told everyone hey we're we're going to be donating the profits um so if we had to buy all the stuff ourselves then it was going to be a lot less and our partners leapt into action and provided us with almost every single part you guys have seen today whether they're from our
Hardware Partners or java. G um so we are going to be donating over "20,000 um I believe that's US dollars" "right that's correct over $20,000 us to" one of our local food banks um which is pretty exciting um what was I talking about final clue inid video card Nvidia Nidia oh was it the was it the 3090 the 8K gaming the sponsored video nope a dang it okay I don't know then give him a thumbnail then uh number 14 oh the mining GPU no wait no that wasn't the mining one that was uh some sort the
what now a100 yeah yeah yeah yeah what was the title it was like Nvidia wouldn't send me their fastest GPU that was a good title of absolute Brilliance that title honestly sometimes that matters more than the content of the video in terms of getting views on the platform if you just have like oh CP down here your next one is real click baity okay it's real clickbaity wow that really narrows it down yeah really right uh 2223 uh from May of 23 okay 6.8 million views in the first
year 6.8 million click baity huh and a pretty static video if I remember right static video oh electroboom collab oh that's a good can can static kill your PC is that it not not static in that way static is not moving not moving do you have any ideas no I don't I mean I can't even get this screw in what's going on yeah that's usually my job to put together computers okay help me put together computers why why is this going what were you thinking Dan what were you thinking Dan I'm not paid to think I'm sorry
sir help me you're doing a very good job uh oh you cross threaded it oh it's the wrong screw what okay so this is actually such a common error for novice Builders oh sorry one um there's two threadings there's M3 and there's 632 and depending on the manufacturer and sometimes even depending on the case within their lineup uh you'll they'll use a different threading for the motherboard standoffs it's the one screw in the PC that is not standard okay but why did all these ones go in because you
used different screws you used M3 screws they look exactly the same they don't why are you taking those ones out if they because they all have to come out because now that you've cross threaded it um it is stuck in the standoff and when you tried to unscrew it you unscrewed the standoff underneath I see so the whole thing has to come ma'am I can smell myself now is it these ones I'm glad that it's I'm glad glad that it's you cuz why do I  I I mean yeah considering how open things are why is it
uh sorry um no I'm just saying because you know I I would because I don't have to hide anything from you because we know we're honest and honest and open um and it's it's just it's less embarrassing you've seen me at my worst already there we go so we just got to get okay so I'll show you the difference now please oh one of these was also wrong so I don't know what happened there but see how one is a button head okay so you got a button head screw well there three in this pack yeah one of them is a button
head with a little like circular order thing and see how the threading is different yep I see that now y so you want these M3 threaded ones for this particular case if you'd been building one of the systems earlier you would have been using 32 for the motherboard tray because the industry just didn't think it was necessary to standardize that I mean honestly it's a miracle that they can agree on as many things as they do agree on um okay wait and before you put that back down did I have the right ones
coming out the right uh the right cables and stuff the ones that connect to the motherboard that's a good question I this one was coming out this way I love the way you're thinking you know about like having the right things you know pre-run and everything I don't know if you've got them right but I love that you're trying to get them right that's um that's pretty cool most most inexperienced Builders do not consider those sorts of things but po Von builds computers with me so she
knows that if we don't sort of run it the way that I'm just takes extra long particular redo everything yes that that that thing she said that um I can't uh push back on I know this should this should stay back there uh there's a couple that you're missing for down at the bottom but it doesn't matter oh we're just going to take off this peel this is a little easier to get off now all right I I just building both of these computers is that is that what's happening no you can just
direct me just tell me what to do okay all right well I can put this in now that I know that okay so I'm using the one that has the ridge or the rim around it yeah okay yeah all right it's that  job she doesn't know what things are so I don't know what you're talking about get away with all s all sorts of stuff help me all right absolutely not she's still she's still it was honestly one of the things I liked so much about her she was like a a private school kid and um who whoa
okay that very naive that has some seriously negative connotations there I just mean you didn't have you know no I mean I mean beyond the a lot of experience in the world um I feel like with private school kids it can go a number of different ways though that's true that's true she wasn't the skanky kind of private school kid thanks well no I thought that's what you I thought that's what you were trying to avoid uh who brought me a bucket of standoffs I do not need this oh that was me I
thought I thought you might have destroyed one of them no no it's fine thanks it's just stuck in there okay that also implies that I was you know a rich spoiled brat oh not a rich not a rich private school kid we both grew up um not not privileged um yeah I remember when I was young my parents used us to we used to share a home with my cousins and we didn't have washing machines or dryers and we used to wash our clothes in the bathtub and hang them out to dry I feel like that taught us a lot about
how to work hard yep uh don't don't forget that you slept in the car while your parents did their nighttime paper root y um this one time we were in the car and my sister and I were like oh wouldn't it be fun to see what it does if we release the emergency break on a hill so I think we were 10 and we were rolling down on the hill that was terrifying yeah I don't know if we slept  that um yeah any who um what were we talking about uh Jordan do you have any guing here just tell me which one it
is I don't care anymore you were stepping down it's time what's time oh stepping down as CEO of the company can you believe taran's been here two years wait what I have no concept of time that that was May of 23 so not quite two years okay two one and a half sorry okay still the final video then was from December of last year oh yeah it's um what was our oh wait what December of last year 8.5 million what December of last year 8 and half million sorry thank you I didn't even
think we had any like 8 and a half million Mega bangers that recently I don't even know just just tell me that was your TCL x1g all right yeah the world's biggest TV I still love that thing I ultimately even though the high sense has the edge in some ways I ultimately kept the TCL the accounting was a little less complicated um fun fact by the way I just just confirmed this with the planning committee the high sense will be at the Christmas party this year wow the 110 inch TV is gonna be at
the Christmas is not a small box to deal with y'all good seriously that's your reaction to that where am I going to put 110 TV well I don't know don't you have a wall I do have walls don't you have a ceiling put it on the ceiling who cares it's 110in TV let's go that would be pretty cool Andy you going to put in any tickets one you're going to put in one and hope for the best that's how I won  sh yeah and Andy want a crazy massage chair like I think that thing was worth as much as a car yeah
"$5,000 something like that 15,000 dude" if you win another like ultimate grand prize with one stupid ticket people are going to call Shenanigans like there's no way there is no way oh do you want are you going to MC the Christmas party this year or should I get gold to do it oh I assumed I would be MC but I I guess technically there's no reason that I have to be I don't know it's up to you yeah yeah I'll do it sure yeah I mean if he like really wants to do it then that's that's fine I'm not going to I
think everyone assumed you were going to do it but I just wanted to double check yeah I'll do it um am I missing a fan still oh yeah there it [Applause] is how's your build going okay I got the that fan out because I couldn't get the um I couldn't get it in oh oh okay okay now before I put it back other way yeah that's what I wanted to check okay so this way yes okay and which way do you want the wires I think the question is which way do you want the wires this way I would go so that you have
a a little bit more slack okay there you go see this is why I ask these things I know I know I'm oh sorry I'm super easy to be married to I actually don't know how you work on this table it's really tall I'm having a hard time really my own wife my own wife with the short jokes I see how it is I see how it is uh oh oh I was like oh no I put the thermal compound away nope I was still holding it all right let's put this on oop man this is quite a bit more challenging build you you you unlocked
out the the one we were doing earlier the AMD build was a little bit easier what makes this one hard uh it's just a little tighter to work in yeah yeah I  I and I have to do this left-handed I have less of the I mean you're okay with your left hand not   screwing oh man how about some merch messages that that sound like a good idea it's great working with Ivonne cuz like I can get it I can get it out of my system you know it's like uh the things that I can't say to literally anyone
else it's it's good I can't make those jokes oh man okay yeah uh Jordan is that all you have for like guessing games and stuff are we are we on to Dan is he able to do some merch messages go to Dan I mean realistically most of the people having merch messages Red probably left them like 3 hours ago probably yeah were we going to do those like top five or anything like that are people still enjoying this not worried about that are they still into it Dan I think so all right cool yeah we
still got some viewers hey thanks for tuning in today you guys really appreciate you all right hit me Dan J thing hey lmg just moved out and straight into the big city what advice would you give to a young person living in Vancouver don't live in Vancouver I'm so sorry yeah is it too late is not affordable move elsewhere yeah I mean there's a reason that he and I settled in Su and it's not because Siri smells so good don't take oh man no see we're trying to get in good with the city of
Sir right now okay uh if anyone from the city of Siri is watching our agricultural industry is important agriculture is the backbone of a functioning Society Etc um it just doesn't smell good that's all that's all uh man there was a day what was it a couple weeks ago when the man the business Disneyland upstairs was like uninhabitable it was it was I don't know what kind of poop they were spreading in the fields nearby but it the animal it came out of was not healthy not a healthy
animal that being said they said that um the population in the city of su is going to overtake Vancouver in the next 5 years so they're working on making sui much more of a city they want to call it Metro Siri not Metro Vancouver that's their goal okay that is I'm paraphrasing atrocity that's ambitious well I mean they've made a lot of progress have you seen like Sur Central like when we moved in my parents used to live on the corner of King George and there used to be um I joked
with Ivon that if she didn't put out then I'd have other options on my way home that's a good joke and now there's like there's just so much more development going in like the SFU is there I think the um which is a univ a local University or college I always forget that people don't know um and then there's another University that's going in like the medical program is going in there next to the hospital uh City Hall had they' built this like crazy extravagant building they've
upgraded them all it's just completely different y um but traffic also sucks now yeah call me when you have a hockey team I mean realistically that's what makes a Canadian city a real city um there's no parking ride take that City got them okay wait wait come help me where kid nothing against Quebec City I've only been there once and I like drove that's too many times don't know anything about Quebec City where do these go hi um those go nowhere oh I don't so this one is she's trying to
figure out RGB wiring which is it's a nightmare uh so this one right here the female one uh is going to go into one of these and then all the rest of them are going to daisy chain into this one and then the very end one that has these metal contacts sticking off it you're going to make sure it has one of these covers cuz otherwise if it accidentally touches any metal it'll um it'll short and it'll maybe cause a fire okay wait so why did you have this coming out the top cuz now it won't go down I asked you
what on you want to com out and I I think oh oh no you put it in like that what do you mean in like that you get that in there I didn't I I asked you oh I see um now to take this out don't I no no you could probably take one of the ones down here plug it in here and then run the daisy chain up to here and then just I don't know Jam back here or something what hilarious yeah that'll work okay yeah just daisy chain to that one instead of from that one and then you're you're you're g to g you're fine
everything's fine everything's good uh oh I plugged in my power connectors but I haven't plugged in my fans yet so I'm just going to go ahead and do that Dan hit me hi lonus I recently bought a un hi Dan reference 7900 XTX and notice the VR temperatures reached 98c while gaming and 106 on furmark should I be concerned I would get a little bit more ventilation in your case uh theoretically it's not going to kill it probably but I would I would probably get a little bit more ventilation in your case
yeah hey lonus wanted to ask if you have any opinions on the vajaro Arrow VR headset I still need to try it they sent us one like a thousand years ago and I it's been sitting there begging me to try it along with a bunch of other cool VR stuff that I want to check out um I still have the wireless uh index adapter that I I have spent several hours trying to get working and I got as far as booking a consultation with their Tech Team to like help me fix because I just could not figure it out um and then
I had something catastrophic happen oh my sister died um and so I missed my appointment and then I just like was not not into it for a bit and I just put somewhere and so now that it's out of sight it's out of mind so I need to do that and then once I have that done I want to check out the jaro varo arrow or whatever it is they also sent over one of their other ones they look super cool but I've just been a little behind on my VR stuff because the reality of it is usually these days when I have time to
use VR I just kind of want it to work and so I've just been using my index because it just mostly just works um I think it's like I think it's an aging thing I think I'm just like getting old and I just want things to work when I uh when I finally have a minute to sit down you know I don't know do you feel the same way about it yeah but I don't know if that's aging or being burnt out or both oh oh we're talking about this really live okay she's been telling me I should take a
sabatical for like years not a years long sabatical like she's been telling me that I should take a sabatical um what if you just took Mondays off well see I tried that and then just when you try and get out they suck you back in I hardly ever actually get Monday off I theoretically I have Mondays off and then it I think it turned into a work from home turned into Monday's work from home and then and then sometimes I come in I managed to get have most of yesterday off which was nice um but I
don't know it's just one of those things like you hear Nick talking about you know what it was like back in those days days and it's just been it's been go go go grow grow grow um all this time and uh she's right um you know that's the thing about your better half is they tend to be right about things just I'm I'm tired but it's um it doesn't feel like it's it doesn't feel like it's in a place where I can just kind of like walk away and Let It Go autopilot for a while without something screwing up
catastrophically so it's hard to speaking of screwing up catastrophically can you just make sure that was a nice segue I like that nice that was a pathetic high five though um this way yes that looks good just put in the CPU nice nice no no you got to push it down a little more that that thing's got to hold down the other yeah there you go okay yeah yeah it sounds bad but it's good it's a good thing lonus have you ever dropped one of your kids Christmas gifts I don't think
so have I have I ever like broken one of the kids Christmas presents I don't I don't think so I mean I almost screwed up I felt like I was screwing up assembling that trampoline remember that when we did it in dark yeah that was not the greatest I don't know I don't know what I was thinking you didn't drop anything wait was that Christmas um it was wasn't it it was cold think so yeah yeah I don't know why we were installing it during Christmas but yeah well because we want because no it was my
stupid idea I wanted to them to like wake up and see it in the morning like magic magic Santa assembled a a trampoline in our backyard even though I mean never mind that it was December well that's exactly weren't going to jump on it for 4 months or whatever but um I don't know you know what I wouldn't undo it I wouldn't undo it totally worth it hello from Ireland oh sorry no sorry I just remember us being so angry I was so mad at lus it was so cold and it required so much strength cuz I think we
just didn't know how what we were doing I think we hired somebody when we moved the trampoline to install it correctly and he was so fast with one person he did it in like less than an hour and it took the two of us like three hours to assemble it the first time it's one of those Springfree ones um really nice really nice trampoline very happy with it but um not the easiest to install if you've never done it before hit me Dan hello from Ireland hello Ireland what's up where do you
recommend for making cool argb lighting patterns shout out to Borna from work for going in with me on screwdriver shipping uh I don't know I use signal RGB on my computer at at work because I have that NC sign PC so I just have like those really long strips and Signal RGB works for that and other than that I have to confess that I don't give too many Hoots about what my RGB patterns look like so I have never really cared um that's where I'm at on that I'm very sorry if that's not what you wanted to
hear but congratulations on uh um saving on shipping hey LT uh you talked about being too well known to do scrapyard Wars would going in another province with a different language help with that like doing it in Montreal maybe Ivon and I were talking about this just last night and she was kind of talking about uh how it's impossible for me to go anywhere in Vancouver at this point without uh well I shouldn't say anywhere if I went to like um you know I was about to say if I went to like a
crafting supplies store but we totally got recognized we did at a crafting supplies store yesterday obviously it was by a you know young awkward man um um no offense wait wait wait Sor I think he knew he was a little awkward do you want black or gr surprise gray okay um you know our demographic basically but like if we go somewhere where our demographic is not really present then yeah there's a there's a good chance that um that no one will recognize me but if I go somewhere like an electronic
store or whatever else then the odds are are extremely slim like it was a miracle that that guy in the Taiwan Tech mall I didn't know who I was he actually posted later that he totally watches the channel he just like I don't know maybe he just all white people look the same to him or something why would you be in Taiwan in his shop yeah exactly a billion years and you know what I totally have the same thing where no matter how well I know someone if I see them in the wrong
context super important I've got nothing like I literally when I was a kid I saw my teacher at the grocery store once this is someone I spent 6 hours a day with 5 days a week didn't recognize her it took me like a while to recognize her I've had relatives that I've run into like just on the sidewalk and I have not recognized them until they recognized me and like said something like it's it's 100% a thing for me so I yeah I 100% can relate I get it um but anyway we were talking about it and I honestly don't
think it was any better what I don't think it would be any better like what I brought up to her was back when we went back to visit her family in um in Southeast Asia and this was this is when our our kid was two so okay I try not to get too granular on the ages so sometime in the mid 2020s um sometime back then I was in Malaysia at a restaurant and Buddy comes up and is like oh your LT U you know can I get a selfie or whatever I don't think selfies were as much of a thing yet but
basically like oh I watch your videos you know whatever um and so like how do I how do I say this without it like I'm not trying I'm not trying to brag or anything that's not that's not the point but within the like young man demographic I don't think it's going to make a difference um and like the thing about the thing about Quebec is that even though it is a french- speaking territory or whatever Province um not territory that's technically a different thing here uh even though it's
a french-speaking region uh a lot of people especially in the urban centers where there'd be any good you know scrapyard Waring a lot of them speak English anyway and will watch english- speaking content there is a really good frankophone Tech scene so they don't have to watch english- speaking content but a lot of them do and part of it is um improving their English so yeah I don't think it would help cool idea though I'd be down to do it where we have to speak French the whole time
I'd be at such an advantage because the most French thing about Luke is his last name that's it that's all he's got I  French hit me Dan sure I got about 11 to go wow okay with the crowd strike breaking computers earlier this year and Microsoft 365 being offline for most of yesterday what software if any could be used in the place of software as of service I don't know because a lot of the software that we used to rely on instead of software as a surface has just been replaced it's been it's it was
software that was from these same companies who now no longer offer a buy once cry once option it's it's extremely frustrating and I don't know I don't not I don't know how to solve it I'm not I know how to solve it they just need to like stop doing that but I'm not in a position where I have any power to force anybody to do that um I think it's something that I think it's something that as an industry not as an industry as Industries whether it's like media industry or oil and gas resource exploration
industry or whatever as Industries we're going to have to come together and figure out tools that we can use that are not reliant on on this stuff and we we haven't and I guess in a way we kind of uh we kind of have ourselves to blame as well um if we if we allow these these these tool makers these these software developers to sort of Bend us over a barrel like this and I guess that's kind of on us at least to a degree come help me oh what's up there's no instruction manual so which way do
these go on oh sure uh oh it's down there it just fell out oh yeah okay cool well first you're going to need the spacers spacers M you need the blue spacers so basically what you'll do is you'll hold this on they used to come with adhesive on a lot of the AI water cooling kits and stuff but they don't anymore so you'll hold this on and then you'll put all your blue spacers on and then you will put these on uh like this right like that okay and then like that on the other side so the curve out and
then do I put these blue washers on or screws or whatever those are called then you put the black screws on top okay so here why don't you do one to completion cuz that'll hold the back plate in place I'll just I'll hold this for you I mean it's not like I have to build a computer to or anything yeah I mean you can't leave till I'm done so oh this actually I can we drove separately today oh dang it but but I wouldn't that means I can leave without you too yeah but you're not done your computer
all right there you go there you go yeah I think this is your other one here yeah thanks okay what am I what am I even working oh I got to get my power supply in okay hit me Dan just got an s90d qo Leed why did Samsung have to put the bonad dong conve amount all the way at the bottom of the TV that's a funny thing a good question I've stopped making fun of it because I'm just used to it now I guess but back when LG did their first few generations of oleds um it was right on the heels it
was it was coming up into the brightness War the brightness War hadn't really started yet um and it was it was right off the heels of the um I think we were in the midst of the number of K's war and we were coming off of the thinness war and LG would have this ridiculous marketing for their early oleds uh boasting that they were just 4 millimeters thin or whatever but it would be you know along the top and then they'd have this giant Caboose at the bottom so it's not like you can get it
any closer to the wall that is until they did their Gallery Series I'm talking about the earlier ones and I remember making fun of it back then and then I just kind of forgot about the Ridiculousness of it um but no you're 100% right it's hilarious to kind of Market your TV as that much thinner when actually at the thickest point it's not really thinner at all and I don't have a solution to that other than to say Samsung why are you so silly that's all I got hey speaking of
Samsung um dude This TV has turned so many heads I was freaking out about this the other week so this is high senses like kind of knockoff of the um of the Samsung frame what they call it canvas yeah uh it's the high sense canvas this thing dude I want this thing so bad hey Von remember in the living room how we uh we had them put those recess power outlets where the previous owner had those like art illumination lights y I want to I want to get once these get a little cheaper I want to get two of
these and put them there because this is incredible dude you haven't seen this yet I don't think but man they nailed it they nailed the look I think we got this for a short so we never even like made a full video about it or anything it has the has the magnetic um interchangeable things on it just like the Samsung frame one does uh I don't actually know how to put the gallery on down yeah yeah I assume somewhere in here or something art mode there we go okay man they nailed the Finish they
nailed the illumination so Ivonne check this out you should get get her side does that not just look like a painting yeah it does I don't like the frame but yeah it does oh it's interchangeable okay but like oh shoot sorry you distracted me and I dropped the screen it just looks like a painting it's I it's m it blew my mind and like it is back lit and if if you catch a light directly it'll have glare on it and like stuff like it's still a TV but they just and the viewing angles
aren't perfect but compared to everything else that I've seen they just nailed it I don't know how to if you go left and right it should there we go it's so good it is so good yeah it like really manages to by by being this flat and by doing a good job of I guess ambient light sensing or something I don't know I don't even know I like I said I I didn't even work on a video for it or anything but uh it just does a really good job of seeming like it's just naturally lit I don't know it's
really cool TV and what's funny is like you don't think about this until you go to actually shop for it but buying an art you know like going to a gallery and and buying art is so expensive like it would actually cost if we wanted to get like a good one or something like it would actually cost as much if not more to buy a nice frame and a nice art to put on the wall and compared to the TV I just put a TV in there and I have whatever art I want even just the frame would probably cost as much as that TV I
know is such a horrible like Bonkers Tech bro way to think about it but I just I don't know seems very practical to me so yeah I I want two of those actually okay which means that we can put that Michael thing downstairs instead of having it above the piano and then we don't have to come up with anything else to put there sure you can do that as long as you help me put this in oh okay uh oh okay here's your problem what uh this fan needs to come off oh yeah they ship it with it on just
to save space in the package and I guess to like show you how it works because you're going to have to put the other one on for yourself anyway um but it just goes like this there you go and then you screw those see those screws that you can now see y yeah you screwed those in okay why doesn't this come with instructions probably when the systems were prepped uh someone missplaced them  life like why did someone you know lose this I'm yeah I don't know a it's a really good question you know what the
reality of it is people are for the most part doing their best and uh you know stuff happens I mean there's no way that I have perfectly kept track of every little piece of everything that I've had out today so I'm not going to judge today not today um and there was there were a lot of systems to prep and look at poor Jordan over there look how tired he looks do you stink as bad as lonus what's that I said do you stink as bad  computers can't hear you no he his hard work was like yesterday
yeah I can't believe we got 16 computers built today and we did not all of them happened on camera like Dennis made it like what 40% of the way in Dan you think if you look through the door to your right Andy there's a whole bunch out there yeah yeah Andy you should go check him out here we go I think you mean to the left though hey there they are so who actually like worked on them there you go there's ree Dylan and Josh and Rees and Justin hey Justin maybe new guy okay how
bad were mine were mine okay mine were okay yeah all right nice the others were yeah okay well that was the deal today is I had to build computers till I got good at it so uh if Rees and Justin say I'm good at it then I guess I'm good at it I guess I don't have to build computers anymore that's interesting how many computers do you think a new person somebody who's never ever done it before would have to build to become an expert um oh see that's a tough question because it depends on what you want to
be an expert at and I know you just said at building computer smart guy um but just because you are good at building say for example modern computers that doesn't mean that you would be good at um if someone were to bring you an older machine that they needed help fixing for example so like there are different there are different eras of computer hardware that you could be an expert at and just because you're an expert at one of them doesn't mean you would know anything about others um and so I think 
because oh shoot did I just pull that out like if you handed someone from you know the the P4 era an RGB wiring Hub an RGB Hub and a bunch of RGB wiring and stuff they'd be like this is ridiculous right but if you were to hand someone who's only ever built modern computers IDE hard drives and Optical drives they'd be like what do you mean you slave and master I'm having flashbacks move the jumpers around on the thing and you got cable select so then it should just know based on where
you plug it in on the cable but that doesn't always work especially if one of the drives was pulled out of an old machine that did have the jumper set and like it's a whole it's a whole thing right um no so it's not so much that I would say you have to build a quantity of computers as that I would say you have to build um a variety of computers like once you've done it enough the odds that you've kind of seen every curveball increase but if you were to just build 500 of the same computer I would
say you are probably not an expert I would say you are um you are probably a really Speedy assembly line worker but you are not necessarily an expert computer builder at all you have to troubleshoot you have to you have to fix other people's broken stuff you learn so much faster fixing other people's nonsense than you will just building things from scratch and building them properly in the first place um you also get a lot faster uh if you if you have to fix cuz then like the pressure's on
cuz people need their stuff back when it's a new computer you know people go from not having it to well I don't know not having it until they have it whereas if it's something that they're used to using using and they need back right away there's just a lot of uh or it's a it's a w Show streaming machine and you need to go live you know there's you learn a lot more shortcuts and stuff and I'd say knowing the right shortcuts and avoiding the wrong shortcuts is a big part of being an expert right um I don't
know see I would hesitate to even call myself fully an expert because there's types of Hardware that I have never touched like if you put you put an old like uh dual processor Mac in front of me there'd be I'd probably be able to stumble my way through it but there'd be a lot of stuff that I'm not familiar with all right let's plug this in I want to do a build with you where we'll have like a old 486 with the jumpers on the motherboard to configure everything 486 is before my time I uh I only really
got into the DIY scene in the Athlon XP late Pentium 4 era like like Northwood um I know a little bit from before that but the stuff that I know from before that is way before that because I went straight from having in my room a Pentium 90 I believe it was was either a Pentium 90 or a Pentium 166 so Pentium one I went straight from that to buying myself an Athlon XP 2500 plus I missed the entire early gaming era early 3D gaming everything I went straight from playing like chips challenge okay like ano 1602
to and like TIE fighter okay to like Warcraft 3 everything in between okay I shouldn't say everything in between I played Warcraft 2 on our family computer which was a Pentium 200 MMX and then we didn't upgrade that until we got a P4 2.66 so both our family computer went from P1 to P4 and from P1 and my personal computer which was an inherited one I didn't have it for that whole time I like got it later and I was just happy to have anything um I just wanted MSN Messenger in my room um so I I went from
a P4 a P1 myself to an Athlon XP which was essentially P4 equivalent um and just absolutely nothing in between so you hear people talking about how their childhood was like Unreal Tournament uh or like Quake or whatever I didn't play I didn't play Quake until I was running it on like an aflon 64 I that was when I first played Quake 3 Arena at like a lan or something uh okay all my RGB is working let's see if my system works all right hit me Dan hello lonus I work in security monitoring and
I get constant encounter customers with faulty sensors which lead to false positives in what way can we improve the technology used in alarm systems well one of the ways to improve it would be to stop costing it down um that was something that I was super insistent on when we built out our new house was that I didn't want anything Wireless nothing Wireless I don't I don't like Wireless as much as I like wires so even like uh like motion sensors and stuff like that all wired um
and honestly it's not even just like a security issue or reliability issue necessarily although those are definitely advantages the big thing for me is I just don't want to change batteries because as soon as you have a the whole point of a smart home is everything's like connected and so as soon as you put a battery in something you're changing it once every year or two and if you have 50 things in your house that means you're going and changing as some stupid usually some
like random button cell battery like once every week once every other week and you're not going to get around to it and then it's going to kind of pile up and then it's just it's just such a such a nightmare um I'm not really answering your question but the point is um finding wired sensors like security equipment these days is not easy nobody wires anything up anymore and a big part of that is that it's a cost down thing even though the wireless sensors are probably more expensive the labor on
installing them is way less and so I guess what I'm trying to say is until the industry decides like oh yeah we're going to stop costing down and we're going to start focusing on reliability you're not going to see any change and so since no industry is ever focused on uh increasing quality these days and is always focused on costing down I just don't think it's ever going to change you've done really well actually this is is a really good progress yeah you don't want to screw your power supply in yet
because yeah you have absolute wow with your hands you can almost do it yeah are you what's up that's crazy check this out Andy she can actually at least attempt to plug in the you have these like skinny Chicken Little wrists look at her wrists so she can actually get in there and plug in the GPU with the power supply SCP am can what what just like look at this that's crazy well it's hard to tell but uh yeah there you go no I I I can't get in there no no but am I not supposed
to put that in right well just no no you are just the power supply it's easier if you have the power supply unplugged and you plug them all in and then put it in but that's okay you don't actually have to finish I'm done mine which is when each one ends so are we only 17 minutes over time uh yeah wow that's not bad considering we were like 17 minutes behind at the beginning yeah on the first one and my last one I believe should be good to go all right so I think all that we have left is a couple
more merch messages right Dan that's right we got about seven to go okay hit me Dan sure hello lonus what would you say is the most clever ringtone message tone that you've had on your phone over the years I have the sound of the Ping from an M1 grand it's a head turner at work uh I got to I got to be honest with you guys I haven't customized my ringtone since my Samsung Jive uh I just don't care I I am running on both of my phones you will you will see this is not a thing I make up up I am running
whatever default wallpaper shipped on them I other than making sure that all of my icons are organized in groups and are aware I can find them quickly and easily when I have something to do my phone is not an expression of or or my my wallpaper is not an expression of myself neither is my ringtone I think one of my favorites was actually um from a a gentleman who used to work here Tyler who unfortunately uh passed away way way too early he was taken from us um and he had Crazy Frog as his ringtone
which every once in a while he would forget to mute when we were shooting and uh I could never really be mad about it because it was so  uh Hey sh quiet on set you know it's good stuff good old Tyler um I have not been to dream hack Sweden Maas you can archive that one there you go sure hey D land love the channels it's my gateway to getting into tech tech yeah can we get some behind the scenes videos of Creator Warehouse processes and group think since we have Tatiana from CW
there yeah so we've got some stuff that is up on float plane right now uh oh you can also subscribe on YouTube members uh memberships if you don't mind paying more for no reason um other than just that it's convenient because your credit card's already in the system um but otherwise go to lmg Dogg flat plane that's the way to go um and yeah we have some stuff there and I think there's more coming What video during your 16 years would you like to redo for any reason oh man I I would imagine if I were to go
back and watch almost anything older than the last year or so I'd probably see so many things that I would change about them um you know more detail here better production value there um fix my hair here you know whatever right like I H some like some something that I like regret I mean I'd say I've probably said a lot of stuff on W show that I that I that hasn't held up I've um I would undo saying well no one will ever use crypto for like actual purchases back when that guy bought that
house that's one that I I like to bring up a bad line is don't make bold predictions like that what else you got let's see thank you and the team for inspiring to learn more about technology lonus what is a piece of advice you would give to your 22-year-old self marry that girl good advice really enjoyed the equinix data center tour did you find anything there set up to be applicable to how LT manages servers and workstations so going back to the last one I cannot emphasize
enough the importance of finding a partner that builds you up rather than that uh holds you down um so yeah know that that was the best advice I could give my 22-year-old self um I think when did we get married um how old even was I maybe 22 I already knew 11 so 2011 minus 1986 I don't even know that who can who can even do math I can't do mental math um not this late in the day yeah I've been live for four hours there's no way I'm doing Mental Math Dan's got it he's on
it okay he's not on it but he's going to be now that I've said that he's on it I don't think he was even listening all right fine I'll do it he didn't even have his he didn't even have his mic hot when he was saying that it's been a long day for all us 25 sorry we were 25 we were 25 okay yeah no that would have been good advice for me at that age TR answer merch anyway equinex um no there's like there's definitely really cool stuff about their setup but everything that they do is done properly
and even if we could afford to do things properly like they do a that's no fun and B it doesn't necessarily make sense for us like the number of people that I've seen come at me about the fact that we don't have we still don't have a backup for the vault there is no backup for the vault and the reason is because we just don't need it that badly we need it exactly as much as um or like the our willingness to put resource into it resources into it is exactly equal to the effort that we put in to make the
most affordable sensible possible mass storage box that we could with you know making cool content in mind and no more we're not willing to spend money to retain that data it's all finished projects shipped projects if it if we have it it's great it's actually convenient and if we don't have it we will keep making videos without it we'll download copies off of YouTube I mean even flow plane has years and years and years of archived video on it that we can download it full quality no problem
so it's very rare that we go back to an old project and dig up a clip that wasn't in the Final Cut almost I mean I don't want to use the n right I don't want to say never but almost never there's no one from the editing team in here I don't think hey Nicole are you here no's oh she's gone okay oh yeah coming to probably getting ready for badon tonight let's go it's Tuesday wait it's Tuesday wait what time does badminton night start Von it started already it started already oh we're late
yeah we are oh balls it's like 700 p.m. yeah I didn't realize how late it was um cool what was I what was I what question was I answering uh why don't we have backups for the mother B oh yeah because we don't care I was going to ask Nicole how often do you guys like use that and she was going to say never um uh it's come up a couple times but it's very rarely yeah okay and as you said it's often not necessary yeah we don't really like need that honestly we would have backups if lonus cared yeah yeah but I'm
not going to I'm not going to put money into something and then I have people asking okay well like well then why did you guys bother to recover it when it failed well because it's interesting it is actually yeah because it was really interesting that was why Wendell contributed a not insignificant amount of time because it was a really cool learning experience for what happens if you just allow a gigantic CFS server to rot um yeah we don't let it rot anymore so that's good we learned something so
that's cool but other than that yeah we're not willing to put any money into it because it just doesn't matter that much we still replace tries and keep it up to date like we do maintenance on it right yep but if we lost it it would have zero impact on our business and at the end of the day it comes down to Dollars and cents when you're making investments into the business and it's doesn't make sense that's all I got all right well hey thank you guys so much for tuning in
to Sweet 16 thanks to everyone who uh bought a system today uh we're going to be making a really nice little charitable contribution uh hopefully this week but maybe next week well either way we want to get it done before uh before the end of the year uh so that'll be going to one of our local food banks I think um right Jordan we on show we'll let you guys we'll update you guys on when show we'll get you guys uh get you get that Loop closed there um massive thank you to all of the partners
who sent over hardware for the stream today and java. who sponsored the stream today big thanks to all the members of the team who came and embarrassed themselves um the ones that don't know how to build computers the ones that are turning screw driver backwards my I'm listening to you talk I can't multitask thanks speaking of people who can't build computers you're doing great H um hey I'm trying yeah massive thanks to the production crew today who obviously um you know worked hard and of course
the most important members of our production crew are tireless camera operators who are not even going to be able to give me this camera because it's it's tied it's tied to them oh yeah there you go there's Andy and don't forget about second Andy and all the logistics folks um there's reason I see  there nice okay see you guys again maybe we'll uh maybe we'll have to do another one we'll have to find some other excuse to build a bunch of computers it'll be good
