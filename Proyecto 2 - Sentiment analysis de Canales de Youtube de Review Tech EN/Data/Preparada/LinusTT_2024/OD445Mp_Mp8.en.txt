with over 30 of these upgrades under my belt I've gotten pretty good at uh minimizing my mistakes into his house which is why I took extreme offense when Sam from the editing team told me his plan for his "$5,000 AMD ultimate Tech upgrade we made" it easy on him really mine brother Dost thou not trusteth me I mean I can kind of see what he means Sam's a simple guy I mean con guy which is why he used part of his budget for this latest greatest AMD handheld gaming console the Rog Ally
wait this is the old one you're modifying it oh no how is this easy I thought that was your theme have   before we get to the Ally upgrade we need to kind of address the elephant in the room you used to work in customer service which means you've almost certainly stolen some creater Warehouse merch and before I even finish this sentence I noticed that last of us statue how the hell did you end up with that uh there's a website called eBay you know uh-huh so that's not the one
that we had it's definitely not the one you have well yeah it's not the one I have cuz I don't have one anymore how about this one and that one I made that myself you did not I did wa you actually did yes sir yeah it's kind of crappy compared to like the store bought ones yes it is there's also no way that you were dumb enough to pay full price for this Evangelion router that's got to be from work so fun fact I actually made a video on how I made that and that video was the portfolio of mine that I used to
apply for the job wait when you applied for customer service you ripped apart a phone no it was the video editing job oh that makes way more sense cuz that would make no sense at all it's like look how good I am at destroying things yeah artfully that work unless I'm lus hey hey hey hey you're busted on this one you are busted on the dark plates yeah there's no way I can prove it otherwise it's mine I I didn't say anything I didn't say anything I bought it in vinnegar 2200 km what I FLW it
here you flew it here you did not I did actually you air shipped this TV to yourself you know they have ground shipping right I officially believe you when you say you wasted money on stuff now let's have a look at your pile speaking of wasting money did you develop photos what year how old are you that's saved for later I'll show you I'll show you are you just like the world's most well-preserved Boomer enough shaming you for your fake nuts wait these are real they're just ancient
oh no I'm not going to eat that these are so old age is not seasoning whatever my mom would tell me all right get your  nuts that didn't that that laugh says that what he said was true all right we're off to a good start why don't you tell me what we're doing with your R Ally here by the time I got this I did not know that they're going to come out with a new one so I thought yeah I'll just pump it up you know like uh get back played with the heat sink and cool it and have full TB on it so
that I can put every game ever wo all right except one small problem you know that the original Ally doesn't support 80mm M do2s I did think about that and Tada oh that's super cool I'm honestly amazed that this product took so long to exist it's a little adapter for the m.2 slot that I guess allows you to mount a fulllength drive but then do you need an aftermarket back plate or no no it's just I just like it okay let's have a look which gives us a perfect opportunity to show off the new
Precision LTT screwdriver kit oh balls or should I say nuts man we've got a lot of stuff to get to today and I noticed not not an air conditioner boy would that have ever been a nice one to start with what is this flammable liquid you've got as part of your upgrade can you grab that natural renewable green bioethanol for the indoor fireplace I got here you bought what so you're heating the place yep it was cold when I started buying stuff for the upgrade we need to position this screw
exactly sticking up where the SSD is going to come down we're going to screw in the adapter so now the screw is sticking through the bottom okay we take the original screw we screw in the adapter we take the SSD we nut it now we find someone with the world's smallest fies basically L to twist the it's a good thing you think you're funny and they think you're funny that Elijah thinks you're funny uh does anyone have any tweezers I cannot get this thing and it's made of brass so I can't magnet it
ew ew you he licked his finger he making it sticky that is not a lubricant oh my God fine a now I have to touch your spit finger I used a different finger so your hands are just that sweaty wow that's so much better he bought a fireplace it's hot in here it's not on though okay oh my God you guys this does not look like a simple upgrade oh we got to rip the back buttons out and the triggers and actually I didn't think about that before it's supposed to cool this yeah okay there boom so that
does come off perfect or just throw at my idea of reading the instructions yeah lus please read the instruction before you stick look the heat pipe obviously goes there right sure you can say Obviously look see look Lego okay in all seriousness there probably is some Hardware that needs to yeah there's like oh my God there's a lot oh hey comes with the gloves uh here we go Elijah I'm not doing it actually that seems like a really good idea okay Elijah uh you could figure this out a
okay let's go look at something else while Elijah figures that out AMD is doing another giveaway this time for three of their brand new ryzen 7 9700x CPUs that come out today this latest chip features eight Zen 5 cores 16 threads it boosts up to 5.5 GHz all while having just a 65 wat TDP all you've got to do for a chance to win is visit the link in the video description now let's continue the upgrade elij is looking chilly why don't we move on to the fireplace next I'm going to assume
it goes here to replace this caveman technology fire that you've got I'll help you out with that yeah I was going to say what brother what are you doing it's like the whole thing is liquid that's probably so before we get any further then don't touch this when it's on okay all right okay it can't be that hard I had to fly it all the way from Germany so you got like tattoo from India fire from Germany is that like your is that your thing  worldwide all is all that's left is 
best this is what I hate about hiring "viewers 1,00 Watts why damn Elijah we're" going to get you right taken care of you'll never be cold again God oh yeah it's spinning on your hands uh yeah no I think we're good I think we're good I think we're good I think we're good well that's okay the excess fuel will burn off along with the house well not if we light it outside let's light it outside okay wait don't we we turn it on or something I no did you read the ow it's hot wait
don't do that then oh it's on fire it's burning oh I get it that's what the spiral here is for oh that's so cool so it uses convection to do like a twisty flame thing oh that's sick here you go Elijah really right there for your convenience and warmth okay I don't it's really hot above it I was trying to look down and see the spot yeah dude it's fire it's fire oh well thank you you're welcome uh can we not have it here no no this is a good spot for it's not part of the upgrade
oh all right well why don't we do these speakers instead then want to show me where they go yeah let's go to the bedro you going to get the other one also let's go to the bedroom we really got to stop hiring fans what what wait a minute we didn't come in here when I was looking for stool this is the Evangelion PC from short circuit how the devil do you have this also you took your name tag from your desk it's from Creer Warehouse it's my uh what do you call it name tag no but what do you call that name tag
souvenir souvenir it's for dude you can't just decide that stuff at the office is a s is this a souvenir yes I actually wanted to part yeah that's what they all say talk about these speakers so yeah I want to get into to music production because I like it as a hobby I can continue on the Sony 1000 hm4 XM 4S so want this the Yamaha hs5 in your own words tell us why you feel it's important to have studio monitors rather than you know doing music production on something like these Sony
xm4 well it's as important as RGB is to gaming no no for real like for different special um scenarios you want to uh play it out and test how it sounds cuz like something sounding good in headphones it doesn't mean it's going to sound good in speakers or car so you got to have this got it okay and I see you've already got yourself some nice stance some don't I barely got it high  buddy Amazon quality let's let's lay flat maybe oh really yeah yeah oh okay all right okay
this way is is there a correct way move the Twitter away so that it's as separate as possible okay but that's just me though don't comment and roast me please yeah go ahead comment roast him I mean that is the whole point of these videos right for all the armchair experts to tell us that we're doing everything wrong that's the only reason we upload to Youtube I mean if we didn't want them to do that then we would just make the videos keepe them on our server watch them for our own enjoyment we'd probably be
happier yeah oh that's going to be really loud you may want to turn those down a touch something dead mouse of all people taught me is that with a particularly high quality speaker sometimes it's difficult to tell that you're listening to something way too loud so I went into his studio and I like turned it up to a comfortable listening volume and he was like whoa whoa bro and like turn it down  okay man studio monitors are just such a I want to have really good audio hack
like especially when you consider that what he paid for these that 400 CAD yes yeah it's less than people are spending on like stupid airpods Macs or whatever you know which are not even close but are portable so you know teach their own see you later why are you here I finished really yes sir I'm good job hey were you going to wipe the inside before you reassembled it no it's not my job his fiance said he she likes the other one better oh really really yeah the one without the big thumb print right here
there's a th print over there I told you to wear the gloves man yeah he said no glove no love it was already so hot in here I'm not putting gloves on I actually had to turn off the fire how dare you I'm sorry it how dare you I was starting to sweat starting to oh my goodness well everything else is stock right yep wse molding on the aftermarket back actually pretty good sometimes these third party accessories can have fit and finish issues but this is nice I like it why don't you take it for a test
drive and show us your gaming skills actually this isn't really going to work to show you guys why don't we set up the RGB Docking Station from J sou same company as the back plate oh okay then I actually have some confidence that this thing won't suck let's throw it up on the TV I think I need this one this is the plan with this one right uh yes this is 100 100 yeah okay okay cool then yes I let's redo that just go fck it up I didn't want to look incompetent do you have few your later no really that
close to the TV burn it'll be fine can't bir to fall on me and kill me it's a whole new meaning to the OLED burins it's not going to kill you maybe another concussion that means I get time off while Elijah's working on that I would like to discover why it is that you burst out laughing every single time I touch this London Drugs photo lab envelope it is part of the whole setup I planning uh which is the meta Quest 3 mhm okay well here's your meta Quest 3 explain uh why didn't you unbox it
actually oh my God what is wrong with you guys wait are these are these you no who are they who who is this this is Elijah's eyes where did you get that photo really yeah okay wait what there's more do you know about this no I   me  oh and he can't put a helmet on successfully he really is a Liah we really need to stop hiring fans I hate this so much yeah now you know how I feel you ready to stop sing now yeah I'm over it cuz this is what you look like I want the helmet meme to die please I
always love doing video projects with editors because they just like are on it like oh how are we sinking that audio oh how are we doing the screen cap it's nice no one else thinks of it like the editors do where is it again though I don't remember believe it or not I cannot see the things you see right  creepier you find aiz a creepy man oh my God I can't believe I'm putting this stupid thing on here can I oh it Su it I feel ridiculous dude you are not getting a helmet I could see you don't see me I
can see   unbeliev well that helmet's garbage now I'm not putting it on I thought you were going to it's going to be like Thor getting his hammer back want to find a spot for this yes sir wow it's really warm next to that you know creative warehous doesn't leave you you can leave cre warehous but like it stays with you I don't know if that sounds inspirational or creepy that makes it sound like we're even more of a sweat shop than the internet thinks I was going to say cult
that's why instead of restraining orders we gave these simps jobs I didn't even watch lt2 that much shut up you have I've had multiple people bring this up to me you're in encyclopedic knowledge of every video that we've ever made they'll be like yeah yeah whenever I'm not sure I'm like hey have we ever something he'll be like oh yeah that weird obscure part was featured in a completely unrelated video at probably around the Midway Mark and I'm right every time you know you can choose to
get rid of me anytime oh that's a nice Rumble satisfying no seriously here fill this Rumble why you guys got to make things weird well you told us to feel the rumble there's only one controller  we need to hire some adults technically I'm an adult I'm 18 plus oh weird you're an adult just refer to yourself as an adult yes please when you say 18 plus it immediately incu stop okay feel that Rubble hold it hold it o ah right yeah you feel it depth feel the dep immediately made it

actually Bluetooth meaning you can put it kind of anywhere in your sitting vicinity Colin apparently chose right beside the couch that's nice it'll be like a nice  something the vibrations won't be that bad right what's this then you guys are just having a party without me of course a crab raave party can I join of course your couch is orange you have got to lose this simp Behavior what's about orange really oh my god really did he already own these they were under this
the entire time the moment you left for lunch he lifts it up he's like they're going to match the pillows now see I was joking before and it turned out to be true okay I don't want to be that guy but like come on is it same that he's not arguing that it's not the same he's saying you matched your couch to the comp's color I thought I was the S you are why are you trying to get us out in traffic you doing it no you're I'm the back yeah no I'm the red one I'm the red one I'm

251 G you're done Bud my goodness the controller weighs more than the Drone that's wild yeah we don't need the controller up so I haven't played around with any of DJI stuff in the last little bit really and I probably won't cuzz what the US government's going to like outlaw them or whatever got them they're  it oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God okay please can we cut it can we cut  stop it's too fast what an upgrade man you got the handheld console you've got the upgraded couch we've got the
