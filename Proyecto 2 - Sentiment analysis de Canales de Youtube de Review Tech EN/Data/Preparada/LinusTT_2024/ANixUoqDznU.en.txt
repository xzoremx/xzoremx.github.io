here it is folks the highlight of the AMD booth at least for me the ryzen 7 5700 x3d it may be dressed in The Emperor's New Clothes they didn't have any physical samples here for me to hold but I'm genuinely stoked on this thing a new am4 processor all these years later it's clocked a little lower than the 5800 X 3D that we know and love but it has the same great 3D vcash and it comes at a gorgeous drop in replacement for your existing ddr4 platform setup price of $250 making it a no-brainer upgrade for
someone who wants to increase their gaming performance but doesn't want to invest in a whole new motherboard and system memory I love this move there's a handful of other new ryzen 5000 series chips that flesh out their lower end options but given they're the only ones they bothered to bring to the show what AMD really wants to talk about is these new ryzen 7000 CPUs but first let me paint a quick segment way to our sponsor headphone juice is not something you should be proud of these are your
typical headphones that accumulate heat while you game e wiked cushions added cooling gel to their cushions to keep your ears sweat free you can easily replace them on your headset check out wikied cushions the link below in my hand is the ryzen 7 8700g which AMD is calling the next step in personal AI processing from a CPU standpoint there's nothing to really set it apart from ryzen 7000 series I'm looking at eight Zen 4 core 16 threads ddr5 memory on the same am5 platform
we're already familiar with what sets it apart is everything else instead of having kind of weak onboard Graphics we're looking at the same rdna 3 based onboard Graphics that we've seen in amd's Mobile chips that power devices like the Rog Ally so behind me you can see Starfield and balers Gate 3 running on this chip at okay admittedly low details but 1080p 60fps the games are freaking running without graphics cards so I think it's fair to say at least if amd's performance numbers are to be believed
don't worry we'll be validating them later that this is the final nail in the coffin of those entry-level graphics cards that have always offered a really terrible price to Performance ratio but now just don't need to exist at all moving down to the 8600 G you get some expected reductions in Spec two fewer CPU cores four fewer GPU cores but that same AI npu processor that we're kind of waiting for software to make use of but hey it could come in handy someday and then as you make your
way further down things get very interesting the 8500g has six cores just like the 8600 G but two of them are traditional zen4 cores while four of them are Zen 4C's but before you go gee that sounds an awful lot like Intel's hybrid architecture it's not quite the same Zen 4C is architecturally the same as Zen 4 and should have the same performance at the same clock speed but the difference is that they're crammed in tighter meaning that they tend not to Turbo up as high so there is an expected
reduction in performance also the 8500g doesn't have the AI processor and has a lesser GPU you rounding out the lineup is another noow the 8300 G which has only one traditional Zen 4 core and three Zen 4C cores I'm going to be really curious to see how that thing performs one thing I know I'm not going to like is the name I don't see how upgrading the onboard graphics and tacking on an AI processor sometimes "necessitates an 8,000 series but I guess" you know sometimes you run out of
numbers and you just got to kind of increase the series except no you don't have to do that you can tack on letters like they've done with the 7600 XT this is a pretty significant upgrade to the existing 7600 T of while you won't find any increase to its stream processor count or compute unit count there is a bump to clock speeds with the corresponding power bump and perhaps most importantly an increase from 8 gigs of gddr6 memory to 16 gigs of gddr6 memory which as we've seen from our benchmarking of this
card can make a pretty big difference in games that require it there's a couple other little things to cover the support for display port 2.1 uh10 is now mandatory rather than being optional like it was with the 7600 and the price is 330 bucks meaning that you are looking at a pretty darn good 1440p gaming experience even in demanding games like Starfield for a pretty reasonable price this is running at  yes I have cushions hot like a tiny steam room stop steaming your ears like
your broccoli W cushions offer all sort of cushion replacement for your headphones and it's not just your regular cushions with added dual layer cooling gel they ensure you keep a cool head even your team is feeding looking for a crack wiked cushion give you a crack-free comfort they Ed topnotch materials like breathable sport Fabric and memory form "with over 25,000 reviews and a 365 days" to fall in love warranty don't listen to me listen to your ears this time Wicked cushions and the link below they had
some other cool stuff in the booth like the framework 16 modular gaming laptop but I think that's going to be a dedicated video so uh I'll see you over there
