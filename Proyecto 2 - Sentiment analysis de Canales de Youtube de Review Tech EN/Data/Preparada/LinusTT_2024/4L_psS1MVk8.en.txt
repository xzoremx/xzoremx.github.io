since the last time we did this MSI has expanded and upgraded their lineup a ton including excuse me what are you doing MSI sponsored this video they want us to use the new branding without the dragon MSI can get rid of the Dragon when I say they can get rid of the Dragon bring it  out anyway the package that MSI sent over is packed with their latest features in Hardware including an $1100 motherboard and some categories of products that they didn't even make last time around which can't seem him like
this are you okay buddy yeah I'll be fine tell you what I know it'll make you feel better why  intro last time we did this we kicked things off with an Intel CPU but uh what in the world could that be the AMD ryzen 9800 x3d features second gen 3D vcash eight Zen 5 cores and even overclocking capabilities for the best possible gaming experience of course we're also going to need a motherboard but uh don't worry we've got quite the motherboard for it oh gracious it's heavy the new Godlike x870 costs as much
as an entire computer and I guarantee is more motherboard than most people will ever need but MSI still wants to show it off because this thing is packed with unique features that after taking a look at them I think could eventually trickle down to boards for regular humans and outright change the motherboard game first up is this interesting magnetic attachment that they're calling easylink you know those motherboards that have connectors on the back for cleaner Cable
Management well this takes that Concept in a different direction and consolidates all of the motherboard connectors in the top right for easy management just make sure that your diamond encrusted case has the extra space that you need to the right of the board to accommodate all of these cables next up by the way Elijah don't think I didn't notice this Dragon here is the m.2 expander Z slider see if the five onboard m.2 slots aren't enough for you this adds two more Gen 5 slots and the
best part is they can be accessed from the back of the PC without ever opening the case now now they're not hot swappable yet but this little asterisk here seems to indicate that that could be a possibility in the future I mean imagine it your Internet is down you forgot to download Cod on your PC you can rip the game drive out of your buddy system throw it in here slide it in like a magazine copy the files and boom nothing because cod's not going to let you play without an internet connection
anyway now obviously I'm being a little factious here I actually kind of love the idea of using m.2 gumstick drives as SD cards for Mega Ballers however impractical it might be then finally this has got to be just about the most stacked IO that I have ever seen on a consumer motherboard kind of looks like that what Gamers actually want me realistically there's too much to list it all out so we're going to toss it on screen and you can pause if you want to read all the specs finally finally MSI boasts
"supported memory speeds of over 9,000" megga transfers per second over "9,000 but this one gets a little" "complicated it only supports it at 9,000" for one stick per Channel and it's got to be single rank ah yes we haven't talked much about single rank versus dual rank memory but here's the tldr a rank is a grouping of memory blocks that are connected over a 64-bit memory bus if all of the blocks on the memory in a stick are grouped together that's single rank if they're split into two well
that's dual rank so what does that mean well typically at the same operating frequency dual rank memory will outperform single rank memory thanks to memory interleaving but the complexity of a addressing dual rank memory means that it's harder to overclock to higher megat transfers per second so the more ranks you have the harder your memory controller has to work and the lower the speed that your RAM will run making matters even more complicated it's not always obvious if the stick is single or
dual rank but you can bet that higher capacity dims will be dual rank so because MSI doesn't produce Ram themselves we've gone with a pair of 48 GB Dominator titanium from Corsair at "6,400 megat transfers per second on our" Godlike board oh speaking of Corsair we used them last time for our SSD but just a few short months later MSI entered the SSD game so this time we're going to be using their latest and greatest the spatium m580 a 4 TB Gen 5 SSD with rated speeds of 14.1 gab per second reads and 12.6 GB
per second rights and also it comes with a gigantic Tower cooler let's go Gamers all right let's get this business installed uh oh is that a tooless  cool now the spaces shum will obviously be our boot drive but we also wanted to check out the expander Z slider so we grabbed an extra 8 TB drive from our inventory because let's face it we can "afford $1,100 motherboard"  this uh do you not want to put it in the case first nope I want to see it in all of its Glory if you made me show it off
without this in it that would be glory  whole I broke him he tried not to laugh he can't it seems like the entire industry has gone 011 Dynamic style but in an effort to differentiate their offering MSI has added curved glass to the mix with their Maestro 700 lpz there's not really a lot to say here than ooh shiny and for $400 I would certainly hope it is actually I lied there's a lot to say about it it supports up to eatx motherboards it has a front USB 3.2 gen 2x2 so that is a 20 gbit per second
front USB port it has this cool little window at the back which you will need in order to build your computer because this curved aluminum piece here is continuous and doesn't come off and it has excessive radiator support like I'm talking up to a 360 mm in the top of 120 in the back a 360 on the side and up to a 360 in the bottom that gives us a lot of options for cooling but because we're using an AIO specifically the core liquid e360 we're going to use the top slot to keep our pump at the lowest
point in the loop and we're going to fill up the rest of our slots with yes that's right friends even more MSI they're easy one 20 a RGB fans these are pretty cool they use a magnetic connector in place of your typical fan and RGB cables making the setup much easier and cleaner man nothing makes you appreciate these cck and everything's hooked up like dealing with the regular fans we're going to get all the RGB hooked up though this take a minute while Elijah works on remounting our
bottom fans for the third time I want to talk about our GPU this is the Supreme Liquid X 490 it has its own integrated Supreme it's got a red sticker on it look anyway the point is it's got a 240 mm Radiator on it and I can't believe I'm going to say this but going with a water cooled card like this maybe not that ridiculous in this specific build see the thing is some aircooled 490s are really wide like like up to four slots wide which would limit our access to this motherboard's pcie slots but this
card only two slots wide which well wouldn't have made a difference because our next down slot is all the way down here but hey they've both got lots of breathing room and all it cost us is "$2,800 " though In fairness of regular 490 is like 2 Grand anyway I need to get this out to do b-roll is there a thing there is it's this button no way yeah oh GPU release button and it holds it so if you let go of the button it's open now dude what the heck did you see how many flipping headers this thing has oh yeah
two of the OG USB front headers two of the new type c what case has any of that connectivity this is the last motherboard you'll need for am5 lineus had to go start Wan so I'm going to install the power supply which is another category MSI has actually gotten into since the last time we built their computer and this is their Flagship AI 1300pa quick test with Lucas in the power supply tester in labs and he described it as nothing crazy impressive or bad which is more than I can say
about some other products that has AI in their branding and 1300 watts should be  gpus the leaks about the 50 okay whatever now that everything's built we're almost ready to game all we got to do is lay out our LTT mouse pad we no LTT mouse pad we have to use msis a can we have ours under theirs what do you  think thanks for voting yes ooh that's kind of cool I'm not sure how much I love the surface but it looks amazing some of the marketing they have for it is fast cooling surface so you're
like wrists and hands don't like get it all too sweaty Splash and moisture proof they know us better than we'd probably like them too especially you for our keyboard and mouse MSI sent over their Forge GK 310 combo for $70 you could probably buy a better mouse or a better keyboard but as a bundle that's going for just $50 at the time of filming it's not a bad value easily multiple times better than that Tommy hillfigure kit that we looked at a couple of years ago these seem like odd
choices considering the caliber of the rest of the components when I asked MSI just to send whatever they want for each category this is what they chose for the mouse and keyboard okay they have better stuff maybe we'll link some of their better stuff below as well as everything else it'll all be linked below like this this is what I'm talking about the mpg 271 qrx this is a 1440p 360 HZ QD OLED display this is like the top of the flipping line what does it do like a th
nits Peak brightness for HDR yeah th000 nits Peak brightness not to mention near instantaneous pixel response times not to mention it looks absolutely flipping gorgeous I mean not right now I got to  let's go man how sick does this look compared to the last all MSI PC it looks pretty good like it doesn't feel like in the moment that the industrial design of computer hardware is changing that much but then you wait four years and you build a machine and you're like oh right
yeah that looks sick by the way how do we end up with white Ram are you going to blame MSI again they wanted Corsair Ram these were the highest dim corsairs at the fastest speed that would work that's why I chose them I chose speed wait what is this background when I got it all set up it popped up hey do you want to install all this MSI stuff including the wallpaper and I said sure I didn't know it was just an ad for their motherboards MSI we already bought the motherboard that's the exact motherboard
we have what are we playing I installed Dragon AG Dragon Ball fighter Far Cry blood dragon or Yakuza like a dragon yeah Dragon thanks high it's lucky you did that oh great don't you love this about modern gaming while we wait let's take a look at the new claw oh the worth buying claw oh sorry actually this is going on short circuit you're not allowed to open it is this a bit I'm not even kidding no this is the the battle mage claw right correct you're not allowed opening it
but go subscribe to Short Circuit you'll  oh she's smooth dude this game at these settings this is really pretty it's kind of pretty and also still only manages like 75 FPS in the lows good Lord I think I even saw a stutter there do you want to try a different game to push the frame rate we also could try the new Indiana Jones game cuz we have the recommended specs for Ultron dude I would probably use dlss on a game like this on the requirements for this game if you wanted to hit 4K Ultra 
dlss your frames are dropping in the menu no holy crap this looks incredible that's a pretty game can I change my uh camera view no it's first person this game is it yeah this game's first person why the hell am I playing with a controller then why would they say the controller is the optimal way to play seriously a is to clear bushes that's a pretty dumb way to do that we don't see his face maybe it's  shyo here we go oh there's Harrison Ford well if you can afford a system like
this you can definitely play the new Indiana Jones game wow at 60 FPS on 1440 wow oh yeah we're 1440 we're not even 4K wait no no no no we're not even 1440 I'm using dlss let's try something that should be a little more reasonable to run how many FPS we got 600 oh damn it no no no that's insane oh no come on come on get one human kill you can do it yeah let's go he was playing like a bot but oh double snipe Let's Go Go played this well before no way this is officially the greatest computer I've
ever used I'm positive anyway in summary this is an extremely fast computer with extremely fast things in it we synchronized our RGB with msi's Mystic spark RGB software and if you guys enjoyed this video what are you doing you have a lucky puppet you can check out the last time we did an all MSI PC it's crazy I think that was 4 years ago I had a beard a better personality and everything's gone downhill since then what is wrong with you I didn't script that you script reviewed it and
checked it I did not I added it in after that I believe thanks MSI you're so red you're redder than him
