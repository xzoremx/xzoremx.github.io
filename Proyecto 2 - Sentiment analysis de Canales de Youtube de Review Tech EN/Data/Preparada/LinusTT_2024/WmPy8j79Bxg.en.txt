H it's time for St Nick to visit regular Nick who as head of Creator Warehouse has been working away on toys and gifts for LTT store.com for 6 years that is too long sir to be making toys for others and to not receive any of your own so courtesy of AMD we are upgrading your gaming computer we are adding a KVM switch and we are putting in some sweet in sealing audio also you bought an 8ot high snowman why I'm a dad now dude at least this is better than your original plan anyway let's get
started or by the time this is uploaded   over oh it's getting cold outside that's why AMD wants you to stay inside and game they are giving away a ryen 7 9800 x3d and Xbox series X and even some goie hexagon light panels all you have to do to enter is head to the link in the video description thanks AMD for sponsoring our 2024 upgrade series realistically this is going to be a very interesting let's see what you've taken from the office because as head of Creator Warehouse he's got the access
he's got the keys he's already got a prototype hoodie that we haven't shown anybody yet let's see Ridge wallet no way you paid for that I definitely didn't stole my cable management techniques did I just coil everything well I want you to know that that's been sitting that way since I moved in what are we doing with these ceiling speakers I mean we're just putting an amp in there so I can actually use them right but like for movies or like just music just music okay cuz you know their intention was
for movies right probably watch movies cuz there's your Center Channel and your left and your right whoever put these in  work I have no idea what you're saying  this aha aha I found the children's literature box this is going to be really embarrassing you know how upset I'm going to be if you don't have the ABCs and get you piece of did you regift it what no you didn't give it to me you don't have an ABC of gaming me I keep forgetting Nick I just really hungry caterpillar this is on Thursday he
ate four strawberries but he was still hungry what kind of story is that bro doesn't even have the shape order toy I know dude I try to follow the rules and not steal from the office so you steal only for yourself well this is 5 years old or something that's new yeah I did steal this yeah that's true what the heck Nick you don't have a single child thing from our store my kid is like 6 months old you also didn't gift me anything never too early to stop I'm pretty sure I've gifted you stuff
don't even don't Ivon totally shopped for stuff for you and gave you yeah yeah yeah no sorry that wasn't what I was trying to say I gave you nothing though you're right okay sure here we go took the H you took the limited edition only 69 or I guess 70 exist beanie what a guy like you said I can take things like this commuter backpack that only three of exist hey this commuter backpack is right now on a 20% off deal if you buy it through YouTube shopping at launch okay that's a very dangerous claim to
make cuz I I think they're going to supp it might not be a 20% off anymore but it's like everything that's great about the big backpack only smaller and you guys thought that I couldn't resist going into pitch man mode D why am I here you have a pretty sweet gaming station already too Budd got the steam deck got the gaming laptop 100% taken from work with a dbrand skin 100% taken from work the bring that back got the PC what are we even upgrading in here we could upgrade mounting things to your
wall I bet this has been here since you moved in yep hey Elijah no one question I have is don't you run a store that makes Cable Management products yep oh I found a guitar yeah are you going to play for us uh no because I haven't played in literally 15 years come on you got to play something I mean play something are we actually getting on the guitar or no yeah what why no I hate you so much you're the worst person  if you want to hear more of Nick's amazing song head over to lmg gg/
floatplane we have extras not only for Nick's upgrade but a ton of the other AMD upgrades and even extra bonus content yeah lus he's a good guy what is your problem I'm trying to come up with a song on the spot well I didn't ask for I want a Christmas song well I don't play Christmas music look at your house when I was 17 I played in a rock band oh sorry let me get you a plastic guitar then sorry sorry is this a receiver no this is a soundbar yeah wait what you're where are
you putting a soundbar with the TV but  5.1 Elijah I have no defense I just I okay why don't we start with the computer here we go we're going small form factor today boys I couldn't help noticing you're missing a few parts though I don't see say for example a CPU well we've been cooking that up for you but uh we'll get to that in a moment yeah you're not going to build in here because in here I'm going to be working on his new laptop docking station and his KVM switch so he can switch between
the upgraded computer and his work laptop all right I guess now is as good a time as any to acknowledge AMD who sponsored this Tech upgrade where's the CPU well lus we've been cooking something up for you thanks to our sponsor AMD that's the second time we've heard that punch line  what the new AMD ryzen 5 uh 9600 x where's my leather jacket damn it okay let's just build a computer are you reusing some parts from your old one yeah I have a okay I'll go get it and then we'll we're going to make it small
we're going to make your computer small it's going to be good you might be in the running against David for nastiest  dude oh damn all right what all are we taking out of here the Storage storage and the GPU okay cool while we're doing that we might as well roll out the new LT mod man coming soon to an LTT store near you yeah what is this still coming soon by the time this goes up yeah it'll be mid January probably how do you think I cleaned this the last time I cleaned
it 2 years ago not a cloth some sort of uh way of pushing air on it i't been blowing on it have you ever used a leaf blower to clean out your PC cuz I have that's a great part to segue to the next part did you get a new leaf blower yeah it's actually a muler SL leaf blower dog let's go I just thought you already had one I mean cuz I like otherwise what happened here is I got mulched yo bro what's up bro how' you get ASRock to make a special motherboard just for you you're such an
idiot Phantom gaming a620 I light you're actually so dumb it's insane now normally I ask the upgrade e hey why'd you choose that particular processor you know cuz AMD sponsored the whole thing and all uh but in this case it's pretty clear he has absolutely no idea why but I'm going to give him a chance anyway why did you choose the ryzen 59600 X so actually I need to stop you there you're not going to believe this um as I was pulling up the cover I think I hit a pin with my fingernail you
did okay well I will explain why you chose the CPU it's got six cores Zen 5 it's a good entry to the am5 platform which AMD has committed to supporting for another couple of years still giving him a very healthy upgrade path if in the future he wanted to go x3d for like the ultimate gaming but realistically he has a infant at this point so he's not doing much gaming these days anyway also it's going to be amply fast for you're going to be doing some music stuff with it right
uh I mean nothing crazy but yeah yeah I mean well we saw that he's a good guy damn oh hey hi baby some adults even men have this I know right isn't that weird what I've ripped all of Nick's cables out one of the biggest upgrades like I talked about was a KVM we actually got this one from Level One tech Wendell we did a video about this 2 years ago you can get some pretty crazy ones from them that'll do four different computers to four different monitors and the biggest selling point with this is
whenever you change or hit whatever button you're going to you can switch between those computers and use the same mouse and keyboard in this case we're going with one that will support two monitors so all we need to then do is a new pluggable dock for his laptop laptop plugs into these two computer plugs into this one and then he can switch whenever he wants between gaming and work you missed it but he was like standing here and then he was like moving he's like oh do you need more light and I was like no
I got two already yeah he does anyway um that yeah I just used the tiny slot bit in the L let's go Precision screwdriver which should be available for back order at this point how's it look good to me just uh align the triangle to the triangle this is the worst video ever we've made it this far in and there's no B deline merchandise I think we're doing okay let's go excuse "me hey if this video gets 100,000 likes" can you buy me a battery backup for my house and install it what no why what
"would that if this gets 100,000 likes" lonus has to buy me a battery back up from my house and install the original budget he said was I'm deciding between "the new iPhone this $5,000 battery" "backup for my entire house or $5,000 of" S&amp;P 500 let's go I said none of those yeah you can't do f i the battery backup could have been kind of cool it been a short video please hey we did do DIY AC for him maybe we can do DIY battery backup that I'm down for all right let's do it if you'll let me DIY it I will
"build it here if this gets 150 ,000" likes I'll do it personally will tinan supervise you yeah if this video gets "200,000 likes a rivan r1s what no but if" "it gets 250,000 likes I will build him a" rivan r1s we stop asking so let's keep building the PC please we can't keep upping the light count but can we keep upping the light count no thank you I figured out one of the other reasons that Elijah chose this CPU uh which by the way you never actually said when you said you were
going to say uh it's because he's going small form factor and when it set to 65 Watts it's like runs super cool so you don't need a ton of cooling for it okay why did you choose the CP so you should have the right thermals because at the time of the budget we were already kind of pushing that 5K Mark and we could have gone with the 3D chip which would have been a little bit more expensive put him quite a bit over but he didn't need it the games he's telling me he plays is like track Mania yeah so like
we don't need to justify it we can save a couple hundred bucks and get him something else I used to try messaging him being like hey do you want to like game with us or whatever and he'd be like I'm like an old man and I go to bed at 9:00 so I can't you when have you ever messaged me to game not in years cuz I gave up this is a lie dud don't make me dig through my Steam Chat history with you go for it I have messaged you go for it to be fair lonus you messaged me at 12:30 and was like
taped a tape and I'm like lus it is midnight yeah so do you have school in the morning you follow coming over remotely we literally do have school in the morning are you sure those little screws don't have come out why is this back plate not coming off I just hear my motherboard cracking I'm like H okay did you check the instructions on this okay got a thermal r ax90 x why the instructions so we know what to do what but you're the guy oh you can use either we can use the oam
back plate we just got to use different Hardware everything is fine okay so we cracked the board for nothing no no no no it's not cracked it's good here listen do you have these I have what these idiot what am I doing remove the bracket oh my go why you have the instruction why because those are for amd's competitor and I used the c word kind of loosely here to be a competitor  CEO you know what the worst part is he had a cable management like netting that he just wasn't using it was just all on
the floor and the desk is metal so the MCM stuff sticks real easy just never used it can you hear him right now why would I cable manage something I can't see you're getting burned so hard good perfect that's it yeah uh did you put the logo on upside down it's a fan wait are you kidding me right now dude there's another layer there's some surface mount components on the back of this board that are like making it so this is barely going to fit I guess PC part picker lies it's not compatible
dude these incompatibilities are flipping wild it can't because of this are we just like missing the point somehow it can't be this dumb right it can be this dumb the pressure of the CPU Cooler is not f is going to keep the CPU in the socket yeah no I instead of this I understand yeah but this is theoretically not fine and shouldn't be a thing yeah oh yeah cuz the moment you take this cooler off you're ripping that CPU out yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hey I mean I already screwed
up one of the pins so he's just trying to get a free motherboard I think he already is already is a free motherboard thanks AMD I really want this computer to work Nick we've installed RAB and CPU we've been here for 2 hours I don't even want to go any further until I've seen this post all right so let's grab your power supply which by the way is total Overkill I don't know what Elijah is doing specking  he needs like a 500 W power supply brother he has a 380 TI 370 TI what damn
it you did say 3070 I can't believe after the one AMD thing he didn't upgrade in his rig we're at the Christmas party yo let's go I won let's go no Elijah Don't you'll put a hole in the wall at least I don't have a steep staircase okay good luck everybody I just need to see this thing post and then I'm comfortable building the rest of a computer you don't want to build a small form factor computer and then have to troubleshoot it it sucks give it a sec she's got to do some
memory all right okay well that's great okay so I don't need to build this anymore oh okay you can take over now oh that was stressful Dude using our LTT Precision screwdriver with integrated bit storage wow amazing see how long this this cap spins wow we got a fractal Tara here you guys know the drill it's a good case it's why we keep using it can I get some service around here some entertainment somebody yeah right that's what I'm talking about I know believe it or not this is the show people watch
this for entertainment can you believe it okay what are you what are you what are you what are you working on over here we got PSU I think ready to rock here okay cool yeah let's throw that in do you ever put the SS yeah oh good job you should put it on the back slot if you ever want to upgrade it's easier access on the back no no no no you put it on the back now so that later oh if you want to expand yeah let's get some side panels on why did I end up doing all the work again this always happens man my God
doing you might feel a little pressure hey all right that looks great she's B give the these panel gaps remind me of a Tesla got themom wow this is so much smaller than your old computer and less dirty okay while lonus finishes reviewing a video we're actually going to get started on his in seiling speakers we bought this Juke audio this is the Juke 6 cuz you have five speakers in the living room here so we'll do Zone one zone two and zone three in the living room can be the living room we'll
do zone four is the kit can be the kitchen five could be the living room and then six can be outside that's how we wire it all up Okay so we've got them all in the clips now now we just need to plug them all in and then power it on thankfully this does do ethernet but I don't see an ethernet port here not yet no which is okay because using the app you can pair with Bluetooth and then add it to your Wi-Fi so it'll still work totally fine and the app setup was actually like surprisingly easy when I
tested it at the office so hopefully it'll be just as easy here but let's plug them all in yeah it goes we got the Juke app installed it gives us the Ethernet or Wi-Fi option we're going to go with the Wi-Fi yeah and then I should be able to you see see these little options down here you can sometimes pick where you want this to be so we'll try kitchen yeah it'll take a second it's working let's head over there that one sounds like it's on this one doesn't sound like it's
on okay we might have to double check that connection yeah let's try the dining room oh shoot is no happen oh oh I hear that's the living room we might have crossed our streams a bit here that's okay we can rename it in the however it works and the other thing that we can do is we can work on pairing zones together because we set up those speakers as like two two and then one we'll be able to go into the Juke app and combine all three of those zones as like a room or a grouping and then from
there in the same interface in Spotify it'll show up as whole living room or whatever else all right so while Elijah is figuring out the zones we're going to start unboxing the Soundbar so we can have that ready to rock this might actually be the one piece of the build that I can just literally do myself think so yes okay that's really interesting because all I did was I unplugged those living room speakers and plugged these ones into those ports that they were using so it makes me a little
worried that maybe ports Zone one and two on that Juke might be damaged I'm going to do the same for those speakers and we'll try rep putting it back and  out as you saw by the baby jamming out we did get the Soundbar and the sub working from the Soundbar kit but as you also probably saw me running around trying to figure out what's going on I think some of the speakers might be damaged or something the cables might not be run right or something because if you look at the patio speakers the
cables are kind of going down into the speaker meaning if there was ever a chance that like condensation built up on that it could be dripping in I have these seven speakers working so the kitchen and the living room and when we've tried to swap the zones around on the Juke it was just not playing with the other speakers yep again I don't know if that's a Juke problem or the speakers in the ceiling problem but you do have audio working if you want to try it let's give it a try right now with
your phone let's do it there we go I can hear all three at least this one is working we have this whole section of the house music up boss is here to inspect I thought you were going to get an AV receiver and then you were going to use these speakers that are wired up here for like uh five channel like surround sound and then you'd use that I wasn't aware that these were in a five surround setup I thought it was five speakers just in this room and so we had ordered the Juke
already it was already on its way so  juked you know what if Nick's happy I'm happy yes are you happy Nick you know what it's does like I'm happy l now we just need to get this room going I see you guys made a lot of progress in here yes what I did get working is the KVM is set up right now with his laptop to accept all three displays including the laptop one I have the cables for this just run over by the docking station there and all you guys need to do wire up this computer confirm it's
working with the docking station and then set up the rest of the peripherals what are you doing stop stop putting the  there you happy I will be happy once you're off the desk I'm thrilled hey  quality where's my tech tips fit oh my God don't encourage them oh I'm missing another thing network cable maybe I like how you're just lounging it's comfortable bunk gaming setup how have we never done that it's bunk what is what are we even doing here what do you tell me you were complaining about his
keyboard look at I need aard I asked our friends at dbrand if they could send me a free keycap because I'm you know a rat like that um and they were like hold my beer bro I'm going to send you a keyboard but you have to open it on camera oh so you haven't opened this I haven't I haven't looked at this I have no idea what this is oh boy three two 1 what the actual oh hell um they must be trying to say something there's got to be a pattern to the keys that they replaced so they've replaced the e r t o
ow s it's freaking sharp oh what they've done is make it so I can't type LTT store.com wait did you actually just  yes world class thank you dbrand uh short lin.com for not letting me type LTT store.com how about 4 foot n wow dbrand going through menopause no more periods hey look they knew what to say in response to that there we go LGT store.com I was already there I didn't have to type it you debrand yeah got him okay all right so this is working so here's the sitch then
no flicker yeah no nothing so it's something with the laptop well it's either the laptop or the Dock dock yeah I mean either way good enough not my problem not my computer while Elijah figures out what's going on with that monitor you got some more gear here yep uh I got some new headphones I mean you were touching on my my old sorry Elijah my old headphones here yeah not because I wanted to yeah you like them I mean they got that tape Vibe I heard that's really trendy these look like a great
choice I haven't actually tried the dt700 pro X's but they seem kind of Rel oh my God your head is so big yeah it's huge These are nice pretty isolating I prefer that we've got a fine mic arm an at2020 mic and an nexo AI powered webcam yeah why the fancy 4K webcam Elijah did you choose anything nope he had mentioned he wanted a better webcam than he had and we had a bunch of these in inventory so I was able to take it for real cheap and I got a deal your mic arms plasted and I can't get it
open not being able to do how what huh okay all right all right all right  okay okay what all we got here we got the oh look at that got the RGB darking station docking stationing station darking station oh check out this I Sky Cipher Sky Cipher Xbox oh is it clear yeah dude oh cool I love clear Tech dude look at that o so cool transparent Sky Cipher translucent whatever you call it wow you're steam deck has some dust on it brother do you even use this thing uh I used it more a
few months ago when the baby was very young okay there it's not working I mean this is a weird thing to walk in on I trying to get the microphone test working we're doing okay we're getting the Scarlet all set up here it's just updating and everything the headphones it's working as a sound output right now okay we're just trying to get the input working we do have it switching over to the laptop but it'll only do one Monitor and the laptop monitor again I think it might be the pluggable dock but I'm also
going to talk to Wendell about it and see if there's something weird between the KVM and this dog or something all right cool now it's fixed tell me what you did um one of the display port ports is an ALT mode Port so we were probably in the wrong one the whole time such a simple thing I should have known what a sick setup now look at this we got we got all three here and like dude and then now you can be all like hacking the main frame on your laptop and then be like scroll scroll 
boom desktop let's go now now we're Gamers now we're gaming let's game boys it's pretty cool setup though yeah dude that's so smooth now that it's plugged into the right port and I also got a new Macbook which is actually going under the tree for my wife for Christmas um so there might be some footage of that  solution however it's working so we can't get it working wirelessly right now do we think we're going to be able to get it working Wireless I don't know maybe should be Oh
Come come on this is hard yep while he's doing this I'll just do a quick recap man we got his desktop upgraded it's now like a super small power efficient not to mention cool running small form factor we got that sick KVM setup that allows him to nearly instantaneously switch between his work laptop and his home gaming desktop we've got our steam deck dock all set up in the living room here got the Christmas present and of course the most important part a giant in flatable
snowman truly an upgrade budget well spent well and a leaf FL and multure thanks AMD for sponsoring this AMD ultimate Tech upgrade I mean realistically who else who else would sponsor AMD ultimate Tech upgrade if you guys are looking for more like this why don't you go check out um sebastians sebastians yeah he he's actually on Nick team
