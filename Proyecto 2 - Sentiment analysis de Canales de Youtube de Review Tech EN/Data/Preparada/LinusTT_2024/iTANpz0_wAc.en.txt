the whole point of VR is to transport you to other universes but that's pretty hard to do when getting sucked back into  as that's the problem virtuix has been trying to solve since they first invited me to their Seattle hotel room to show me their prototype 11 years ago like before Luke was called Luke now the road's been a little bumpy after a successful Kickstarter campaign that finally delivered the original Omni to their backers years behind schedule virtuix immediately abandoned their efforts to
build a consumer-friendly version and pivoted to working with commercial operators like dve and Busters instead but now they are back with a revamped version for end users dubbed the Omni one it's again a few years behind schedule but they made it and as someone who has made his fair share of years late products I gotta say I'm proud of him for getting it across the Finish Line the only question is in a world where not even Apple can get people excited about VR does anyone still
care I know what they do care about our sponsor War Thunder War Thunder is a free-to-play detail packed vehicle "combat game with 2,000 highly detailed" aircraft helicopters tanks warships and more jump in for free at the link in in the description to snag a special bonus pack and get 20% off at checkout with  lt20 I got to say after my first go through it is way better than the last time I tried this now obviously this is not a perfect solution by any stretch of the imagination
but compared to every solution that I've seen before you know using your joystick to point you or being in a very confined space or investing in an entire room with motion tracking paint lines all over it and the game is designed to make sure that you don't accidentally run yourself into a wall if you want mobility in VR and you don't mind paying in sweat I was in there for 8 minutes and more importantly I want to go back in in but first let's take a step back the Omni one comes in two very heavy boxes but
aside from the weight it is surprisingly easy and intuitive to set up and take apart which shows their experience as a B2B Solutions provider slide some things till they click and you've got this a bowl which we'll look at more closely in a moment and a kind of weird arm the harness thing the arm is height adjustable from 4 4' 4 in to 6'4 in and the bull can handle up to 250 lb which yes includes jumping on it overall the thing feels shockingly quality for something that was at a science fair project grade
the last time that I saw it the arm articulates in three places and rotates around the base locking and unlocking with this button right here there's a knob up here that controls tension and for a beginner of my weight they recommend setting the tension to three this affects how much it supports you versus how much it gives you free movement as for how it holds you up the Omni One uses more of a backpack like system with a waist strap chest strap and two shoulder straps that provide a
shockingly robust and safe feeling level of support it can also be pulled apart and even have the stuffing removed for cleaning which uh it'll need the base has wheels for rolling it around and the step conceals a little storage compartment for any accessories you might need like I don't know what is this a scrubby pad for the dish they recommend cleaning this every single time before you use it not with the scrubby Pad but with a microfiber cloth that they included they also have a
monthly maintenance requirement where you take a little bit of oil or something that they've included and you wipe it down with that scrubby pad enough jibber jabber though I want to play whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you need your shoe covers first oh right and while you figure those out let's talk talk about the headset because it's not BYO the Pico 4E is the Enterprise version of the Pico 4 from bite dance yes that bite dance it's not the newest version of this headset that would go to
the four Ultra so this is more of a Quest 2 competitor which is to say it's still a great headset it comes with a Snapdragon xr2 s so 8 GB of RAM with 256 GB of storage each ey gets a crisp 2160 X 2160 resolution resulting in a 105Â° field of view that refreshes it up to 90 HZ and looks great on the pancake lenses the headset also features a full color 16 megap pass through camera as well as ey and face tracking cameras something you won't find in the non-enterprise version it comes with two controllers
that can be summarized as copying meta's homework and it comes in at 899 bucks which is pretty expensive compared to the 400ish pico4 we say 400ish because you can't get the pico4 direct in North America because of Tik Tok versus USA type problems so why did the company go with the Enterprise version well because they can put their own custom OS on this one and that might be related as well to those Tik Tok problems that we talked about earlier but here's a quick summary
of what that means for you it means that everything works very smoothly with the treadmill but the OS and more importantly the games Library are limited so it's going to come down to how good that game library is well I've got my shoes figured out I settled on the medium size and it's pretty intuitive it just straps on a little something like that straps over the top a little something like that and this is cool they actually got this little flippy thing on the bottom so you can
have your grip and also your slip oh and at the top there's these little clips for the foot trackers ah appropriately the tutorial is called First Steps okay he's unlocked boys let's go buddy hey look there's another one this is exactly the kind of home that I would imagine somebody having the space for  have I am not walking let's just reboot it because uh there's some wonkiness sometimes with their software okay dude I'm sweating we have a tail yeah and and another shirt LTT store.com okay now it's
working let's go woo okay and if you try running you  no this way here we go let's go can I just play a game now is this Co-op yeah so a lot of the games that come with the Omni are what virtuix would put in their Omni Arena their like arcade game stuff so this would be like oh you'd have four of your friends and you'd go to the arcade and you'd all play this game together sick you can play online though the um install base isn't very big right now I cannot not make the leaderboard
here there's four players on the leaderboard one of which is virtuix Dev  boys see you would think when you step you know that you move that direction but the direction is actually determined by the arm o hello all right let's go whoa hi there whoa hey oh hey h boom boom get out of here get out of here get go on go on get you got to escape the toxic area get out of  it okay safe Zone here we go here we go I am freaking sweating brother whoa okay oh you okay oh yeah it's a flawed solution to a problem with
no perfect solution you know what I mean like I fell off at once already which is not the best endorsement what's my where the heck is the rest of my oh my God jeez he throw stuff at you this is ridiculous but I think oh boy come on come on come on bring it on Juggernaut whoa come on go back the responsiveness definitely leaves a little bit to be  I survived I noticed this is not the world's best headset I actually got a little bit of nausea just walking around using p through in it before but as soon
as I got into that zombie experience before I forgot about the nausea all right what am I trying now hyper blast you're playing hyper blast hyper blast Gauntlet of Champions you need to set a time cuz we're going to have staff members try and beat it woo he's going  B this is freaking hard checkpoint here we go silver oh God okay oh man oh my "God 9,300 points new high score let's go" you're 31st in the world you're only you're only 21 behind circumference okay one more try one more
try here we go I got this off to a good start come on get over here boy no I'm fine looking pretty good going for gold come on where you at checkpoint boom silver "God 13,000 points yo is that enough to" beat circumference oh dang it he's beating you by a thousand if there's one thing you can expect from lus it's getting too into a game too competitive I'm tempted to do another run but when I say run I mean it kind of literally this thing's freaking tiring yeah let's talk
about that it's more difficult to walk on the Omni for three reasons since you're always placing your foot up on the lip you're always walking uphill and in real life when you're walking around you're basically just falling forward and catching yourself and you use that momentum from one step to the next you don't have any momentum on this thing cuz you're not actually moving and the other part is that there's friction there's a lot less effort required to move your foot through the air compared
to dragging it on a Surface even if they do come with those slippy shoes so you end up getting really tired just doing the basic activity oh before you take it off I just want to try something this base is only 150 lb yeah can you like Yeet hard enough that it's going to tip like how stable is it like just try like  direction I'd say you'd have to have a pretty strong intent yeah you accidentally remove yourself from this thing you know like yeah good to know I just want to check that because we're
going to get a bunch of different staff to try it out oh cool yeah reys uh he's a tall boy and I wanted to see what do you mean I think you were like 90th percentile in height how tall are you Maria Why 55 CM do the math yeah Ed yeah I'm a little nervous I am 70 lbs over what this should hold yeah this Tech is rated to support 250 lbs Alex's own which means I am 320 lb well um for those math fans out there technically it's out of spec but uh you're over speced for this machine is the issue how
much experience do you have with VR I own a quest 3 you own a quest do you use it a lot or fair amount okay cool what what kind of games do you play fun games I own a br at home meta Quest um I had the CV one oh wow and then it ended there oh my God okay this feels so normal oh my God oh my  difficult that didn't feel good at all I feel a lot of pressure like from the thing like that pulls me backwards you're going to try and run through a level as fast as you can we're going to 
you're doing great I feel like it honestly the Tiny Steps seem to be  steps go go go okay you're doing great yeah they're pulling towards the "side it's so difficult oh my God 8,400" "points is that good no 13,000 yeah I" forget that yeah you did it oh my God no you did not get the best score of course sorry you could try again if you want I feel if I go again I will throw up reality is so much better there go yeah okay how did somebody get so many points so what are your impressions how did
that feel my feet hurt I don't know why the experience was very difficult for me because of the pulling yeah I'm tired those Tiny Steps are you know like I'm I'm already I'm obviously out of shape but this is really awkward it looks very and also it feels like I'm going to fall forward it didn't seem like it was struggling at all with me with some of like your size so like that's great to see do you want to know how much it costs I want to know yes "$2,600 us you get the base and you get a"
VR headset plus the controllers that's a lot but compared to a treadmill I feel or like a pelet that's it's like comparable yeah yeah as an exercise machine it's actually kind of sick yeah like I would buy this over at treadmill would I buy it no but you probably wouldn't buy one no would I spend the money on it probably not thanks for coming out and trying it yeah this is actually kind of fun now that a few staff have tried it we kind of see that even though they technically support
short people all the way down to 44 Maria had like a lot of issues with being dragged back by the arm even in the lightest support setting and that means that if you're close to the margins of who this supports then maybe this isn't exactly for you which is honestly a good question in its own right who is this for hardcore VR enthusiasts sure but I doubt that many would want to pay for the bundled headset and again you can't bring your own while I understand that the company
is interested in making this easy to use I bet your VR enthusiasts wouldn't mind tinkering and the company plans on offering steamvr support but at this point it's unclear how well that will work work and how much support we'll see from Developers for this device specifically and even then the headset you do get is held back by the custom OS making the upside of the VR headset included comment a little bit less compelling I think the strongest argument for this is as a fitness
machine there are lots of people who will spend thousands on equipment that they'll use maybe a handful of hours a week and if your biggest obstacle to improving your health at home is a lack of fun well this this could be a great solution did your Normie treadmill come with the VR headset I didn't think so it probably didn't even come with a segue to our sponsor War Thunder ever dreamt of being a pilot behind the controls of all kinds of war machines well now you can from Sea to Sky War Thunder lets you
