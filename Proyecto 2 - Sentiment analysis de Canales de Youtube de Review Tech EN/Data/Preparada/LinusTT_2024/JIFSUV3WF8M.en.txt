what's up everyone and welcome to the W show especially our in studio audience those are the winners of the 3D down jacket uh buy a jacket have a chance to win a trip promotion that we ran a little while back freaking awesome so happy to have you guys here with us sort of I mean they're like they're here with us but not here with us they are literally above us if I was not short I might be able to reach them we've got a great well yeah we've got a great show everyone's really tall to me oh we've
got a great show lined up for you guys today uh open AI has pushed AI video forward in a big way with Sora and four out of five influencers according to an EU study do not disclose sponsorships I for one am shocked very working in this industry I have met a lot of people and this this is a big surprise what else we got today Luke the great yellow paint debate yellow paint and video games indicating things that you can climb on okay is it annoying or is it not annoing you picked that yeah
that's a headline topic we've never talked about it before and so I saw this in the news and I was like sorry what the f is this how is this anything maybe Luke will have some thoughts somehow this is apparently a big long-standing debate that somehow we have never discussed this matters to you okay we'll get into it later fine but what else you got hit me do I tell you the unfortunate part now or when we get to the topic let's go with when we get to the topic okay cool um and oh hi Mark zuck's
Vision Pro review Zuck Zuck pulled the knives out and uh reviewed the Vision Pro yeah it was actually kind of interesting all right let's roll that intro most companies wouldn't do stuff  that  the show is brought to you by back Blaze Squarespace and C Sonic only they can make the C Sonic that's not what they do we'll get to that later first let's jump into our headline topic according to an EU study of a sample of 500 76 European influencers only around 20% of them consistently disclosed that the
content they posted was sponsored advertising While most of these posts were about beauty fashion Fitness food and travel products some of the ones that are most difficult to quantify yes um at least 119 of these influencers so in in excess of one in five was promoting alcohol unhealthy food potentially hazardous Medical Treatments gambling and financial services such as crypto trading I would be really interested to see the percentage breakdown because I bet you a lot of them are in those last
two uh yeah I well man I don't know alcohol industry is like kind of low-key still a huge industry that's true I I guess in in my circles I hear about the gambling and crypt trading stuff a lot but maybe that's just cuz it's my circles and there are so many there have been so many regulatory crackdowns on alcohol advertisement over the years yeah yeah like you know okay some people might not know this I don't know if this applies to other jurisdictions but I know that in Canada at least you can't
show people drinking alcohol in a commercial yeah they just like hold it yeah they they can hold it it could be nearby while they're like dancing and being cool that wasn't it that was just dancing that was not being cool um I I I I could okay I'm going to try hold on I'm going to try I'm going to try you really don't have to oh that was even what I was expecting I thought you were going to try to dance and look cool while dancing I didn't I didn't expect a pose no no no the pose
was epic though yeah look cool was kind of sick the most I could even try for I thought you were going to bust out the flexing tips that you did before streaming you try look cool try to make the muscles look big yeah yeah for sure so cool dude yeah yeah but I'm so I'm so cool I don't have to say it because if I said it then that wouldn't be cool that wouldn't be very cool D yeah yeah hold on no I got to do the I got to do the thing I got to mash the arm make it look bigger yeah just got to I don't even
work out my arms are just huge yeah they're just like they're huge hold on I got to hold on I got to pull the I got to pull the shirt tighter while I also Mo the hold on there we go yeah what's up up I can't breathe deeply right now  it uh the European commission commented that this exposes a need for modern robust legislation to protect consumers from hidden advertisements while the influencers were unnamed by the study so unfortunately you won't be able to dig in and find out exactly who was doing
this at least 358 of them were earmarked for further investigation they will reportedly be contacted by national authorities to advise them to follow current rules and further enforcement action will be taken as necessary and I know I said earlier in the show for those of you who um for whom sarcasm is not immediately apparent uh I am not surprised by this at all I've spent sorry I thought you done talking there for a we've collectively you probably significantly more than me but but uh
We've collectively effectively caught other people doing this um by seeing sponsorship opportunities come across our desks and then seeing those exact talking points for that exact product in that exact way in that exact point of the video frame yeah um be released on sometimes multiple other people's channels and then having them not being disclosed um and that's happened the whole time I'm sure that's happening now that was happening back in well remember the rules didn't even exist when we started
I can't remember who it was it still drives me crazy because it was such a just Brazen example of what was obviously paid product placement to me uh someone did like a mailbag episode where they opened they opened packages from viewers or something and one of the things they opened was a tablet or a laptop or something and they talk about how amazing it is for exactly exactly the amount of time that they were supposed to talk about it from a campaign brief that we saw from that same brand wasn't it this
uh no okay no it wasn't a tech Creator okay yeah it was it was a non-tech creator that was just doing a mailbag episode all W look at this wow it happened to be this thing wow this is incredible look how incredible it is look how much all these talking points battery life it has yeah well let's try it let's try this feature that nobody in their right mind could possibly care about and um and that was that was pre the disclosure uh requirements from the FTC you know what's funny about that whole
FTC thing was there was one big bust they went after Microsoft around the launch of the Xbox it's always Microsoft the Xbox I know right poor Microsoft man yeah poor poor multi- bazillion dollar company let's feel bad for there's going to be some new AI law and they're going to smash Microsoft with it cuz of open Ai and then Google's going to be like yeah oh cool and then all these other companies going to do the same thing and never get touched by it it's going to happen you're not wrong um so proba came
through the mic sorry where where so where was I going with that anyway the point is that oh right right uh so the FTC introduced guidelines requiring influencers and online personalities to disclose any time that money had changed hands for placement not actually I shouldn't say placement because I think technically product placement is still not covered if you don't say anything   it hold on I'm supposed to use the YouTube stream tagging thing hold on a sec guys oh no my mic's live God that
looks like a nice bottle though wow yeah yeah so if it's just so if it's just there I don't think there's anything that requires you to to do or say or disclose anything but if it's if it's something where there's actual where it could be perceived as an endorsement or it could be perceived as an actual review um as as an unbiased opinion then you you you were told okay yeah there has to be a clear disclosure it has to be within the first x amount of the content it has to be audio visual so
that if someone's just listening or just watching they can't miss it um and ever since that came out we have studiously adhered to it yeah and it's been extremely frustrating because as far as I can tell for a lot of companies and a lot of influencers out there other than that initial bust on the Xbox I believe it was the Xbox One X and people were playing games on Twitch and not disclosing that they'v been paid for it Microsoft got like a pretty hard slap on the wrist it wasn't nothing and then and
then I haven't heard heard of about a single enforcement case since even though this is something that is obviously still taking place on an enormous scale I mean we've had other Tech influencers call it out talking about all the like you know sketchy offers that they get in their inbox to promote something without disclosing it um I can only assume that there are spaces where this kind of thing is more common uh we haven't seen as much of it as far as I'm aware in the tech space compared to what we have at
times in the past but in place in spaces like okay uh financial services such as crypto trading and gambling there is a bit of a a tendency for the participants to um be less sort of aligned with regulatory bodies I think is that is that a fair way of yeah overstepping and ACC directly of um and I guess what's really frustrating for me as someone who does actually disclose sponsorships is that the entire online media industry has absolutely nobody to blame but themselves like we were we were given an
opportunity things were get things were getting out of control you know 8 years ago or whenever it was that the FTC published those guidelines and that's American only here's a fun fact in Canada I am not technically incumbered in any way by FTC guidelines we do have a regulatory body but it's not law it's just guidelines I forget what they're even called because they're irrelevant someone reported us to them and they investigated us and found that the report was because of course it was
um but even if they had found us to be you know misrepresented uh a SP sponsored talking points as our opinion or whatever the case may be they still would have had absolutely no teeth to do anything to us uh but the way that we saw it when the FTC guidelines came out that was an opportunity for everyone to get on the same page and disclose things in the same way to level the playing field but as it is it's really frustrating because I actually put a couple of I put a couple of comments in
the dock here from uh our last video from the video we up loed yesterday the all Logitech setup um one of them is Logitech must have paid you a lot to show that stupid Cloud handheld again that is how much the trust is eroded I explicitly said of the cloud handheld explicitly said Logitech offered to sponsor content on this thing I talked about how stupid it was I told Logitech I'll be happy to take it but this thing is too stupid for me to do a sponsored video about I got it in
my hands and I did a review of it I ended up actually liking it no money changed hands I was explicit it this isn't this isn't something that's like I left it open to ambiguity maybe Logitech paid maybe they didn't they did not and still that's what we're looking at you know wow this channel is getting more greedy and shilly with every video remember the one certainly sponsored by Intel where they didn't once mention  efficiency my friends man that's it's been it's been really interesting watching how
desperately people are trying to like like to got him these days that video was missing a couple of things that would normally be present in a laptop review would you like to know  review so I mean I I looked at this video I saw the title in the thumbnail and I was like oh we did like a sponsored video with Logitech I clicked on it I skipped through it I checked the description was like oh we didn't it's not that hard to figure out yeah back to the Intel thing so the reason that we didn't do a battery life
comparison was because our comparative laptops were not chosen for their similar you know wat hour sized battery any any number that we would have presented would have had enormous asterisks on it it wasn't the point what we were doing was we were looking at core Ultra we wanted to look at GPU performance in particular because that's one of the areas where it has improved a lot meriting MSI releasing their claw gaming handheld with arc graphics which was a big surprise to me when I saw it at CES
uh we also wanted an an excuse to kind of demystify the name criticize the name change the fact that someone could watch that video where we basically say that Intel's new naming scheme looks like they generated it with AI they obviously have absolutely no idea how sponsorships work do you have any idea how much Intel would have spent on this branding Initiative for them to go and spend money to undermine it are you a idiot money for us to be like are you actually stupid is the question you need to ask
yourself um the other thing that we didn't include was the power consumption and another one people were like got him we got him it's cuz on Intel Arc that Intel CPU is rated at up to 65 Watts whereas the AMD one that we compared it against was 35 so they were just trying to they were trying to pull one over on us yeah it's a configur TDP my friends it was running in the mid-30s the whole time chillax got him it's okay and so I don't know man it's one of those things where I just like I just don't really
know how to I don't know how to deal with it at this point the uh the the the the the incredible um distrust that exists it doesn't seem to matter what we say you're not watching there is going to be a certain group that no matter what if you say anything positive about anything they're going to go well it's obviously paid and everything else all the other contexts that exist around it explicitly saying it's not sponsored uh not having any you know sponsored hashtags or calls
to action or URLs or all the things that are part of sponsorships and how sponsorships work uh with all of those things missing people are going to not be able to not be able to discern because apparently 80% 80% yeah so like knowing that why why would you why would  yeah you would be a fool I don't exactly and so I if I'm to address you know this this cynical person right obviously living and breathing being in this in this business for over 10 years to me sponsored content is obvious yeah
disclosed or not it's obvious if the production values suddenly change in the middle of a video gee I wonder why they spent more more time on this it's obvious but to most people it's not they're probably not going to say the entire thing was AI generated if it sponsored content but yeah I don't know I would be pretty sus if this was what was going on I don't watch reviews in almost any of the areas mentioned so I don't think a lot of the content that I watch has this going on
but uh if I did it it yeah I would be concerned about it for sure yeah it's really it's really tough um they're not watching they're just reading the comments well there's the problem no this no actually it was it was a it was thing I I I get it but like I do I do highly suspect a significant amount of them aren't watching or at least aren't watching the whole thing like click on the video watch like 10 seconds comment I mean that Logitech one that's a that's such a that's such a
surprising take though because we immediately dunk on Logitech for their stuff being really really expensive it's very expensive like our our setup I "think we made it to like the $6,000 Mark" which didn't include a computer or a monitor like it was just okay we did have some pretty goofy stuff in it like we had these I forget how much they were they like $800 Bluetooth speakers or something but we also there's if you were paying Canadian prices there seems to be a pretty wicked markup right now
um it was not 30% I think it was closer to like 70 or 80% higher price in Canada to buy a super light than it was in the states I can explain that yeah what's up um I don't know if this is still the case but back when I was managing uh Logitech the Logitech product line at NC uh one of the problems was that Logitech distributors in the country were just kind of trash and a lot of the time they wouldn't have enough stock or they uh wouldn't have good pricing on the product so a lot of
the time what you're seeing is a listing that's just pulled from the Dy inventory feed rather than actual inventory that you've negotiated pricing with from Logitech and are holding in your own inventory this logitech's website so oh this is logitech's website okay problem number two that existed back in the day is logitech's pricing for the Canadian Market was often pegged to extremely unfavorable exchange rates so we would be able to get Logitech products through a reseller in the states for cheaper
than we could buy it directly negotiated through Logitech in Canada so when I was at NC the majority I mean this is all statute of limitations see you later buddy um the majority of the Logitech product that we moved was gry Market that I bought from United States Distributors imported at additional cost and then sold up here because other than having a different part number they were exact oh and no French packaging they were exactly the same product and Logitech being Logitech there are good
things about them too always honored the warranty for it so it didn't matter yeah we would just buy gry Market product they've always had really good customers it would just be cheaper and then our customers would be happier unless they were frankophone in which case they would you know ho why you why do you not have a pricing yeah or whatever French people sound like probably not like that wow please don't get mad AJ I think they're I think they're um I think they're pricing has changed since
I shopped for my mouse and I and not even that and cancelled remember on the pre-show when I was saying that we would not um be unemployed by the end of the show yeah I take it back the the French people are coming for us yep I mean it's a really long walk and they'd have to cross a border into another country to get here so  him okay that's probably not helping AJ is here oh no oh no one of our developers it's so oh it's not that late there darn it well sort of I don't know it's only 10 there um anywh who
were you saying that on him being a developer yeah like well he's infra but like he totally can though did a lot back in I know he can but that's why I said sort of cuz it's like well I don't know sort of yeah yeah he does a lot of things yeah he does the point is uh the great yellow paint  wait okay he just threatened to kill the stream AJ there's nothing I can do to stop you other  here this is the problem with developers is they have too much power sorry sorry infrastructure and
development AJ please do not turn off this stream think think not of me think of Luke think of Dan think of our live studio audience and also Dan was there oh man all right it would be funny though Dan don't encourage him oh man you know how  get I mean France I mean wait  show okay uh let's talk about the great yellow paint debate oh the head Rush all right Luke do you want to start it for us yeah so okay um you know how you were like yeah I don't really have like feelings about this or whatever we've
never talked about well we should talk about it first okay fine I'll go through the thing I I can do it I was just going to sayuk going to do it no no no we got to go through the thing first then we talk about it sure the online argument over developers use of hyper obvious yellow paint to guide players has reignited after the final fantasy rebirth demo had Cloud Strife climb up a cliff face with some very artificial looking yellow rocks this is a debate that has been going on since October of
last year somehow never heard about that um to a screenshot of a yellow painted splattered ladder in the Resident Evil 4 remake many players have argued that this is an obnoxious and immersion breaking tactic to guide players that demonstrates a level of laziness and lack of creativity some game designers have pointed out that these kinds of very obvious cues are often retroactive changes in response to play testers is repeatedly getting stuck still others have argued that these kinds of
extremely obvious signals should be an option within a game settings uh dinga Baba the director of death Loop uh called avoiding these more obvious forms of guidance a choice and investment that requires a lot of communication between disciplines during development in order to ensure that such guidance is logically consistent Within A Game's world and if I remember correctly death loop at had some really cool versions of this that were quite creative so um I think a good person to listen to on that
um discussion questions uh how should game designers balance potential player frustration with breaking immersion and have you ever just completely failed to find an obvious progression point in a game and gotten stuck this is from one of the Tomb Raider games Shadow I think Shadow the Tomb Raider oh they actually did this okay so somehow we've never talked about this on the W show before and if this is such a huge debate I'm sort of surprised that it completely escaped our notice um I
think I have what might be a bit of a hot take here and that's who gives a and I I I have probably just antagonized half of the entire Gaming Community now you know this is this is what happens this is this is how influencers eventually diminish Their audience to nothing all you you have to do is once a week alienate half of your audience and then eventually and in no time at all you'll have nothing yeah  um yeah I don't really care either I didn't even notice it I just thought it
was wa cuz I first saw it in the first Tomb Raider and I was like oh you can tell where to go I usually find that seems pretty useful um that there's some decent explanation like even that Tomb Raider one um in my opinion the easy one it just looks like it's been climbed that just looks like wear it's paint is it paint if you get close enough yeah yeah yeah it's just the quality it's definitely white paint on stuff it's a thing I mean I don't mind it too much this is actually a thing that some
people do do in certain areas like if there's uh hiking routes that have bits that you're supposed to climb sometimes they are marked out so that they're easier to see um I think Assassin's Creed games in the back in the day they would often have um I might just be making this up but but I don't think I am um I believe they would have cans of paint at the bottom of certain ladders that would have paint on them so it looked like it was like an accident I believe that's a trick that's been used
um death loop I believe was an example that people have used where they would use Design Elements to literally have like arrows pointing at the door you're supposed to go into mhm but the arrow would be like the sign for a shop or something and they would put lights on it so it's like really obvious a big  honly it does go here to it's just but it's more obvious thing so it it kind of naturally brings you you're going to have an obvious thing like maybe at least I okay look I've seen obvious cues
for where to go and what to do that just were not obvious to me and honestly weren't fun uh halflife Alex has a puzzle have you have you played Alex no I can't play VR at my place it's too small okay um anyway oh that's sad that's kind of unfortunate the basement Suite actually had significantly more usable space for VR right the current Place does not okay well at any rate it has this puzzle where you do something and like a whole bunch of stuff comes flying up into the
air and if you if you look through it there's like a a code you have to enter and if you align with it in exactly the right way it makes I and it's looking at the right code combo cuz there's like a whole bunch of them on the wall I I could tell it'sing I you want to know one of the puzzles that I thought was just the worst and it wasn't fun like it was just in typical halflife fashion it was just like kind of a slog until I get to the next story there goes another  life um there we go uh of the ones that
I hated was the the Skyrim claw puzzle never played Skyrim how many people figure that out without Googling it or having someone tell them I actually think very few basically um you might have just gotten it by like random chance as well I wonder how many combinations there could be basically there's I think it's three symbols on a spinny thing and you have to uh I did I read the journal yeah okay you and four other people um but I don't even remember how I figured it out it's been
way too long but um you have to have a combination of symbols and the way that you find the combination of symbols is you open your inventory and Skyrim had this like 3D model viewer for all their items and you had to rotate the claw item that you had looted and the symbols  claw was that a mechanic that had been introduced at any point or and as far as I know they use it for claws moving forward but I don't think they use it for anything else shoot I who inspects items exactly I forget what game I
played recently where just you would have to do something and the mechanic for it had never been introduced before and you were just expected to Fumble around and figure it out um and it was really really frustrating I mean it's one of those things where you go back and you you remember older games and you're like oh yeah that was like so much fun I was like right yeah it was fun because I only owned four games and I was nine and had absolutely nothing to do but play this game yeah um I don't
know man I I just I'm at the point now where I if you want to put white paint on something honestly I I'm trying to figure out what game I would care about it being there and find it not fun like if it was a if it was like a if it was a puzzle game and the whole point of it was to solve the puzzle or something like that I might find a super obvious indicator kind of um kind of kind of patronizing you know like I'm um it's interesting cuz like some someone brought up like oh there's no there's no
paint and origins or or something one one of the newer Assassin's Creed games but the contrast I would give you there is the old Assassin's Creed games it was actually like where you had to climb was quite specific in the new Assassin's Creed games you're just Spider-Man right climb on I haven't played Mirage maybe it changes there but in Origins and odyy you just like climb on anything basically all the time like it's not you don't you don't need Paint if it's a vertical surface
just I don't know unless it's like very obviously extremely smooth but if it has pretty much any texture to it you can clamber up it  know Bird poo for leaps of faith that is a thing but that's another one like like I was talking about earlier where I think Assassin's Creed has done this type of stuff in the past where there is actually a pretty good kind of reason behind it and usually when you walk up to one of those leap of faith points um there is actually like eagles
or other birds sitting on that thing so when they fly away and there's bird poop sitting there it's actually extremely logical um yeah I can see that like having to like pushing yourself to make there be a reason yeah for whatever's on there like I like that personally yeah I I I get that um we've got one of our discussion questions is what was a time that you could have used a hint and there is one that pops into mind for me cuz it's it it was an extremely frustrating huh extremely frustrating
thing for me I looked up two things for Legend of Zelda breath of the wild I looked up um where to find some stupid thing where a meteor goes or something because there's actually two places on the map that match the description so I spent like a bazillion years wandering around in Snowy Mountains looking for the thing when actually it was somewhere else got it was not on me and then the other thing that I looked up was you infiltrate this uh cultist base I can't remember what anything's
called cuz I played that game like 5 years ago or something now but you infiltrate this cultist base it's like a really annoying stealth segment and you finally get to the end of it and it's not obvious where to go and I felt so annoyed because all you have to do is put on your use your like you know chica Vision or whatever I I can't even remember what it's called anymore and there's a wall that's breakable but I don't like those types of things there was there was no obvious
reason for me to do that yeah other than you know if I was playing Batman Arkham Asylum and I and it was just the most obvious thing whenever it's not obvious what to do that I would just flip on detective mode and would just show me exactly where to go like sure I would have thought to do that but I was really really frustrated um that I looked it up um what what do you guys they're saying I'm a game year what does that even mean uh apparently other people got stuck there as well but yeah I I felt I felt
really bad looking it up I was really annoyed anyway um it's a metal wall that can be moved using a power yeah but I didn't I didn't know it was metal like H does it look metal it appearence metal I don't know I don't remember obviously cuz I didn't even remember it was a wall that can be moved it just like it was not obvious to me I'm sure have lots of examples I just don't remember I had just gone through a thing like sneaking past guys it was stealth time it was not like pick up a
giant metal thing and it I don't know it was jarring it was there's definitely been a few times where I I've like been stuck in a room room and I absolutely cannot figure out like what the heck I'm supposed to do and I'll spend a a long time trying to figure it out and then finally be like okay I give up and Google it and then realize like when I came in the room I like checked my corner on the right and the hint was like directly to your left so when I checked the corner and then kept moving
in and then eventually looked left it was past me so I just never saw it it's like oh my good and then I'm like much deeper in the complex by the time I missed this thing so I didn't think to go all the way back to the beginning to see it it's just like oh man there's there's been times like that for sure um but I don't know this stuff doesn't bother me too much um when it's egregious like in the in the picture for Final Fantasy 7 it's kind of a lot um and it looks a lot more out of place in
my opinion than the paint splatter on the ladder on the left the the ones on the on the this looks like somebody spilled a can of paint yeah so that one's I'm kind of fine with that the one on the on the rocks on the right is what's funny about this one is they could have made it blue and it or purple and it could have looked like algae growing on the Rocks yeah yeah I think why yellow it it I feel like there was probably a better way to accomplish that a more subtle way the Tomb Raider one
with the white paint it's more subtle in my opinion um maybe it was too subtle I mean here's something that we have to remember you know it was George Carlin who said think of you know the most average person you know or whatever half of people are dumber than that like and and I don't even I don't even mean that in like a like a like a like a you know rude way or anything I just mean it's fine for you to say well the game should be less obvious but I mean what if that
is how obvious it needs to be for 20% of Gamers or you know whatever wherever that wherever that line works out to cuz everything's a spectrum right so obviously a difficulty slider would be ideal yeah but if I'm a game developer um actually that yeah that shouldn't be that hard I don't think so if all that slider does like indicator indicator slider is just takes that one texture oh and just Fades ores unadesidra difficulty and puzzle difficulty yeah and puzzle difficulty
really just is like the prevalence or uh visibility of hints that'd be kind of neat I think I'd like that people are saying the color was because of uh color blindness issues yeah I could see that oh okay well that's an easily solvable thing as well though right I also do Wonder like is it as big of a problem today when it's so easy to find walkthroughs for basically everything like if you're just it's not as big of a problem though it's very easy to Tab out in Google or if you're a console gamer
just like pick up your phone like I was playing um H what was it was it sea of stars I think it was sea of stars it was either sea of stars or chain deos and I think it might have been chain deos and at one point you get to this you get to this dungeon where you do a like moving things around puzzle where you have to move everything right and then you know a thing makes it to a goal uh it kind of reminded me reminded me of crosscode um except that this entire game had not
been that it had not been like a solve brain puzzles game so they have you do one and then they have you do another one and it's like quite a lot harder and then they have you do a last one that's like hard why are we doing this and I was just sitting here going yeah can I can can I just fight the guy at this point like I'm I'm bored so I just looked it up and just I was like yeah if I sat here for another like amount of time I probably could have figured this out but I would rather just
fight the bad guy right now because that's not um what I that's not what I signed up for with this with this particular game I I really like uh this is one of the reasons why I like Bethesda games so much um or old ones I guess but um I really like discovered small st stories so like if you had if you find like uh like backpack like a hiking backpack and some like little hiking gear and like a little Camp Left Behind uh and there's like a note saying like sorry I ran up ahead but I'll like I was just
bored I'll leave some like paint markings to show the easy path yeah it's like yeah just integrating it into the story now totally cool with this thing and I think it's cool instead of being obnoxious like I I I love little things like that and I feel like you can cover a lot of things with so tell me this did we start this conversation not caring and end up caring no I still don't really care much much yeah I mean I care about pretty much everything in video games at least a little bit that's fair but I
don't really care much I'm going to try and think of something he doesn't care   um no he would care about that um I'm genuinely trying yeah I uh something he doesn't care about okay okay here's something here's something the um the unrealistic representations of the male physique I think I got one no I don't care nice yeah yeah I don't care at all yeah so uh so so Marcus Phoenix or whatever no I think I do care you care oh shut up you do not I care that people try to make a big
deal out of it that's not caring a darn that's not in the video game that's just caring about people arguing on the internet all that's not caring about the game fair enough all right yes yes I did it people are saying like microtransactions like I I care about that a lot yeah he cares about that a lot what are you guys talking about no you guys no no you guys you guys you don't know Luke like I do I can pick something Luke gives exactly measurably zero yeah that was pretty good that was
pretty good um there's another argument going on at the same time which is the like explosive barrels argument they're all red of course they are they're dangerous super cool with that they're going to be obviously marked in real life as well yeah they're explosive yeah caution yeah yeah come fine why are they all red I don't know who cares they're going to have some type of like because that's why that's why they're red they're red because fire no I'm sorry you're actually objectively wrong
about that one yeah so like don't worry about it uh speaking of objectively  this I I'm stunned that Dan had you not seen this either uh no I I have definitely seen this I the thing seen the thing that I wasn't sure about is when I saw it last cuz it feels like haha vintage meme from 3 years ago but I'm pretty sure it was like 2 months ago that this video came out um no it wasn't 2 months ago like how old is this I don't know like it's not very old I think this is like relatively early on
with mid Journey was a thing like earlier last year probably yeah but it doesn't feel like that long ago and it's come so far chat says about a year yeah that makes sense Jess and I could not stop laughing at this we were trying to have a conversation that was on the screen and we just couldn't um so good there's we've got a couple of other examples like the AI beer commercial here yeah very good uh anywh who the point is that um open AI has taken a big leap forward with AI video revealing
their new text to video model Sora which creates highresolution videos up to a minute long far beyond what any similar model has previously been able to make some of the demo videos are almost indistinguishable from real footage While others remain surely dreamlike and have occasional AI artifacts like extra limbs popping in and out of existence the model can also animate still images and blend two different clips together into one shot some experts have speculated that sora's improved ability to represent
real world physics May indicate that it was trained on scenes created in Unreal Engine 5 there are some Sora demos on the open AI site we'll be checking those out in a minute CEO Sam Alman took public requests and posted the results on Twitter uh here are two golden retrievers podcasting I I think this is like the worst one that I've seen to be  are I mean it's um it's very impressive but have you seen some of the other ones I intentionally didn't look at anything until wano oh yeah there's crazy stuff
look green screened onto  yeah I definitely see the the dream likeness yeah but and like the the cat's foot kind of moves at a weird angle sometimes pretty much all of them there's like there's a little bit that's like yeah like PA like kind of came out of a oh yeah okay there's if I wasn't paying attention though if I was shopping in a store and this footage was on a TV it's in your peripheral and you know that it was like a promotional imagery of you know their their stupid uh uh dog scarf on a on a dog
yeah no I wouldn't notice look how good the fur is and stuff though that's wild like those two beaches on the left and right of the dog are obviously different beaches yeah and the bird just like actually morphs into to the side of the dog's body when it goes by and like it's gone after it goes past the pole like there's there's some things that are just a little weird this one's crazy to me this one's actually kind of nuts to me the only place that I really notice anything is in the feet
yep um but like the eyes are insanely good I'm going to skip over to one CU there's one very interesting part of it oh if I can find it give me a quick sec where is it Luke's doing stuff Luke's doing stuff he's doing stuff he's finding stuff going to be here oh no um oh wow under capabilities is it on this slider I think so hold on Skull and Bones gameplay right there Naval B we go this one so this one has uh a lot going on one of the reasons why I'm not so crazy about the dogs
podcasting on the hill is there's just not really that much going on this is much more complicated one issue that I found with a lot of these is it has a problem with forward and reverse time mhm some of the video will look like people are in like video that is being rewound yeah and other bits are going forward and it it has a lot of issues with that um there's also still some problems with movement uh but there's a really impressive and a really interesting thing that happens watch this
sign it's going to completely olude behind her head and it's the exact same when it comes out the other end which is actually nuts um right that means that they have to they have to be looking at more than just previous frame more than just previous like 10 frames and the scene cuts and it's still good that's pretty crazy but we'll see if you even notice something really big changes here at the end it took me a few  notice hasn't happened yet to be clear what's happening right
now uh did her oh her jacket changed  yeah wait is it that dramatic oh it's very dramatic hold on okay go back to it go back to it I could tell the jacket looked different I couldn't tell why oh oh oh it's like very different and most  notice okay how many how many frames how many frames was that jacket out of the shot for let's quite a few like a lot okay so it was gone for a while when does it become this jacket cuz does that have the straps on the shoulders so it goes away at like 36 seconds and the
video is a minute long in the wide shot does it have the little like straps on the shoulders cuz I don't see them can you zoom enhance enhance enhance yes oh it does okay okay so what do they look like in the closeup let's   way okay oh yeah no they're similarish they're pretty similar the panels are just a little bit different sizes I you know what I bet it's doing then is it's probably rendering more than just the frame it shows us because that would help it out in a big way kind of like
the like it like a like a like on a treadmill you know so they're they're figuring out what's coming before it actually gets to us so that there's some cohesion and then retaining permanence of what goes off the frame so basically we're probably seeing a subset of the entire frame that is being rendered if that kind of makes sense if I'm guessing I don't I don't know how all this works see like this this motion right here there's a lot of this but this motion right here looks
like it was like that looks like it was in Reverse you know what I mean there there's there's way better examples of that that one's much more subtle um but a lot of these videos are really interesting this one makes me uneasy mhm this one's really uncanny yeah like very uncanny valley for me yeah oh that his face does not look right that doesn't look human uh people are saying they love the knitted helmet yeah I mean he's got to stay warm he's got to stay warm you guys
come on uh you can see it in the water it's it's just like not quite right that wave is to straight look how straight that wave is and then there's something that is the world's straightest wave there was something else going on with it too but I don't remember would walk into a certain type of nightclub and be like no I need to go I belong elsewhere um the straightest wave in the world I will find my people um but there's like yeah there's little bits on the water here where I think it
I think it gets confused about like is this water is this rock that that one Splash happened at like a different speed than a lot of other things like there's just little bits that are like I don't know that flame is the stupidest flame ever but it's stylistic animation so it's like hard to yeah kind of hello fishies oh man okay hm what what this is not supposed to be this is supposed to be like oh paper anime oh paper craft world a gorgeously rendered papercraft world oh this is pretty cool
this one was kind of nuts there's some of its like uh whatever you would call this plumage of some sort um that like doesn't really make a ton of sense I wouldn't notice okay so another thing too I wouldn't have noticed is short form video right like a lot of the time it's so compressed that the movement's insanely good that you you you wouldn't uh oh wow so good the movement's in like absurd very birdlike yeah okay so in a nutshell give it another couple of years and we're not going to
be able to tell what's real from what's not real we've come a long way a couple of years well give when this tool is out this will fool people immediately oh sorry sorry I I was I fool me immediately I was talking more broadly like we're just basically not going to be able to disting like no one can anything yeah so one thing that I will say is the examples given before specifically peopley consum and in the Smith spaghetti example spaghetti especially that time was very difficult
to deal with um because you have a lot of object permanence issues you have a lot of individual strands you have to track I can't I can't but in this no seriously in this his face is actually pretty okay there's obviously morphing issues but everyone knows that's will SLI you guys can laugh everyone knows that's Will Smith I know spaghetti oh none of these have anyone consuming something none of these have something someone putting something in their mouth and having part of it disappear turn it off
uhhuh and I think that's actually a pretty big deal H yeah sorry sorry I'm paying attention Luke I'm I'm paying extra extra good attention like a good boy so a lot of these ones that look really good are a lot easier to do than those brutal examples from the past um but obviously they are clearly a league above I'm not saying they're not I just we're we're cherry-picking easier things now like the dogs podcasting on the mountain sure compared to extreme difficulty from the past um so I think
the Gap would be a little bit smaller than people realize and this is why when people were laughing at that one I was like oh we're screwed because there was  yeah cool um in the future people demand you eat spaghetti on webcam to verify your human in the future it won't matter like they'll figure that out it's it's they already have massive the her head going in front of that sign and the sign being perfect on the other end means you're screwed like they're already progressing
an incredibly incredibly difficult problem um and remember too guys everything that you guys just saw was done with no source so if we're just talking about deep faking there was no source for Golden Retrievers podcasting I mean there was hold on let me let me that obviously it was trained on things so when I say no Source I mean no direct input so when you compare that to the kind of realism that you could achieve with something like deep faking where part of what you're seeing could be real
and only the person who is being being altered to look like something that they're not is actually different it could be even more convincing because you wouldn't end up in a situation where an arm Sprouts out of somewhere where it's not supposed to be you kind of get where where I was going with that so coming back to what we talked about last week where I think it was what 25 the $25 million Heist using deep faked Executives at the company that's today and that's going to
get so so much better so and that's in a situation where people often have lowquality webcams mhm and are in very static situations you're not usually eating on camera which is a very difficult thing to deal with you're usually just sitting there talking or if you wanted to be even more convincing and you were able to use the power of this you could you could say okay uh We've okay this happened to us a while back is a company that we were dealing with had their email infiltrated MH so
they were monit moning our Communications so you could wait for an opportune time when you know that okay the exec is on a safari and you could take your your deep faked version of the exec and you could put them on a truck in the African you know Safari yeah yeah yeah in in the you know African Wilderness and and and have it be convincing you know like yeah sorry the only reason I'm I'm I'm still here the only reason I'm joining this because like that would be so that would be so convincing that
would be the closest thing to that person getting on a plane and showing up in your office to talk about the Urgent money transfer that needs to be done yeah holy yeah and that's not even that sophisticated of an attack yeah my comment I think it was last week or maybe the week before about how a lot of things are going to have to be like actual genuine in person I'm putting all my money in Gold I'm going to bury it put it in put  sand okay for real though you want not investment device device you want yeah
you want not investment advice buy ipv4 addresses for real though like the return on ipv4 addresses has been yeah it's like it's lowkey like nobody in the investment sphere talks about this but like blocks of ipv4 addresses are like uh yeah turns out IPv6 sucks and nobody likes it it's really annoying to work with um yeah the whole thing but seriously we we talked about that a while ago too Google is going to be spending more on Hardware than on people soon um or now now I think I think it was was this year
I don't remember what the news was look it up um but like that's that's absolutely a thing buy companies with a higher with higher level ipv4 block just for the just for their IP blocks yeah um IPv6 rules what are you talking about sure yeah now you just have to get everyone to agree with you see that's  problem uh no there's no problem with IPv6 okay okay hold on hold on guys just chill for a second here we go the problem is not the technology the problem is people and implementation and
it's a things move slowly um ipv4 you know what may be a terrible investment the second that IPv6 actually is the only thing we need ipv4 addresses are going to crash and it could happen tomorrow I don't know I'm I'm not I'm not privy to to information that other people it wasn't investment advice genuinely it was not but it has definitely been a thing if you if you look it up it's definitely been a thing um people are like yeah most of most Fortune 500 companies are IPv6 with no problem so silly I
look okay ipv4 address values over the years I I don't even know how to Google this I don't even know okay here we go ipx ipv4 price history here we go a 14-minute read just stop uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah exhaustion over the years yep so there's been some exhaustion okay the challenges blah blah blah blah blah can you just show me the seriously do not oh yeah there it is oh  on okay so that's an interesting graph that's transfers from $6 to $60 in under a
decade um yeah so that's that's one weird trick so that's so that's something so trending down though cooled off in 2021 but uh from what I've heard it's uh it's still going to be it's still going to be a thing so yeah yeah or don't or just don't buy those maybe I'm late I'm late to the party it doesn't matter because it's not investment advice investment advice yeah you know what is investment advice is investing in a merch message the way to interact with the show isn't
super chats it's not twitch bits it's merch messages so instead of just throwing money at your screen you can throw money at quality merchandise from LTT store.com and also in the cart you can fill out a merch message and it will get to our producer Dan there he is look at that it's producer Dan he's he's stuck in a box folks he can't get out of the box well Dan when you put your arm through the box I mean G I tried I'm sorry all right well you can tell he's not an AI because he has hand permanence
anyway the point is that uh Dan we'll read your message and we'll respond to it himself uh just like you know probably this or just pop up a little message for your mom who also watches W show presumably and they'll see it you could be like hi Mom or he will curate a merch message or two or 10 or however many we're going to do today for me and lukee to address on the show uh there are a couple things to update you guys on for the store if you were looking for something to merch message oh we have no
way we have two new t-shirt designs I had no idea we were doing this that were apparently released in collaboration with Gerald undone who if you guys remember did a tour here and also just makes great videos in general he's got the 14 stops t-shirt for all the color grading nerds out there and the bananas which sorry the bananas what this is celebrating the mighty banana for scale the okay please tell me it's bananas and not bananas okay uh anywh who we also have some uh some leftover short circuit and
Wan hoodies that we found long story but we found some uh for $49.99 while supplies last so those are those are the LT store products for this week okay we need to get people a closer look at this front of this shirt what is oh hi chewy um that's his name it's not weird yeah that was the intent wasn't it it sure was I didn't know actually until you did that zoom in but yes definitely that's very unfortunate okay well Dan at any rate do you want to um would you like to feed us
a couple merge messages here sure I probably got a maybe three for you here dear inore under and uhor n. lld okay weird they're getting very strange what do you think is the next big thing for handheld PC gaming for me itd be a big Battery tech upgrade for Two Plus hours of high TDP AAA gaming well I can tell you right now I don't think big battery is coming because we haven't seen any Revolutions in battery chemistry that are going to do anything more than give us incremental improvements in battery
life um there's certainly there's certainly going to be ongoing chemistry development but I don't think I don't think we're on the cusp of anything that's about to hit mass production and if anything I think we're going to see more battery development driving Industries like Automotive over the next few years as opposed to Portable Electronics so with that in mind yeah um next big revolution I mean have we not had enough Revolutions in handheld gaming in the last little while I
suspect it's going to cool down we've got OLED displays we've got incredible you know uh hall effect you know joysticks and stuff I mean not all at once I guess we've got thin and light devices that are shockingly portable um if I was valve what I would be looking for on a future steam deck is I would be looking for a a generational Improvement in performance without giving up anything on battery they gained back some battery life with the with the steam deck OLED uh it has significantly
better battery life than the original steam deck to the point where I think valve is pretty comfortable with it so I think they'd push for performance over additional battery life at this point i' I'd love to see um HDR more prevalent in handheld devices even though again that'll come at a cost to battery life it's everything I'm saying is just hey you're not getting more batter life I'm sorry about that uh but again all of this is stuff that exists at least somewhere so I think what we're going to
see over the next few years is refinement I think we're going to see all of those things make their way into you know one God of devices as opposed to uh oh I want Steam OS so I guess I'm getting a steam deck or oh I want to play Windows games I guess I'm getting something from uh you know IO orus or MSI or I want Hall joysticks I'm buying a claw or I want an OLED display I have to have a steam deck OLED or a switch OLED like it I I feel like we're going to see um continued competition and I
think we're going to have more choice and I think we're going to have more options for like a one siiz fits-all actually has everything that I want device uh Dan how do I get signed into the merch messages thing I can't sign it's SS so you got to use your your goggle well it doesn't work not my department I think that was me get wrecked use the other one this one uh this one yeah okay I'll try that did you did you seriously block my corporate account from accessing it what the
I think that was me I don't well I don't think technically my hands did it um I see but I think that was a request that I put in what a to be fair I think I'm pretty sure I also blocked my own fine helps again requested that mine was blocked someone I don't I don't want to throw him under the bus now um but someone else would have done it oh so it was one person all right darn it Dan uh yeah yeah we might have some some shout outs or live merch messages we could either do those now or later let's
do one now and then we'll do one more online one and then we'll do another topic Curtis send down a victim I mean um okay they'll do it after the next one then okay yeah okay uh let's see wired versus wireless mouse is there a right choice yes Wireless the one you like no how about one more what what if you don't want to spend extra money on a wireless mouse never mind I take it and I'm the one who's out it now you know what you know what I'm going to do right now hot dogs I'm going
to go on our I'm going to go into our Channel dashboard okay I'm going to go into our Channel dashboard and I'm going to search for out of touch and I'm going to read you two messages about how out of touch I am and you're going to be the  touch oh man I'm going to read the first two shaved Linus is coming prepare yourself um okay well I don't know I don't know what that had to do with anything why so s on wireless modern Wireless technology is so good that like or just use it I don't
know oh this is ironic 250 bucks for a jacket why don't you price it so we can actually buy it we're not all rich like you are maybe you're getting out of touch with your audience meanwhile the person who's about to give us the in-person merch message bought that jacket and okay but I'm out of touch with them I don't know I don't know where they are who they are uh okay anyway I forget what the question was I I do have my dashboard now though um yeah I think the right answer is
basically going to come down to budget to Luke's Point there's no performance advantage to going with a Wired Mouse anymore and the only real reason to do get the right wireless mouse which is like most of them I think it's a lot easier now it used to be that Logitech with their light speed interface was maybe not Head and Shoulders ahead of everyone else but sign measurably ahead of everyone else these days ah yeah there's a there's there's a lot of folks that are making you know sub millisecond wireless
interface mice and Es like light ones like but that don't have super heavy batteries in them or anything like basically no drawback Wireless peripherals I still am not really convinced on the whole wireless keyboard thing no me neither it feels I have one I literally have one but not because it's wireless I use a g95 tkl those are just really nice I just like it a lot I really like the low profile Keys um the wireless of it honestly is more of an inconvenience cuz occasionally I'll rip out the cord cuz
it's like well I have a wireless keyboard like what do I need the wire plugged in for and then it'll run out of battery I'll be like this is stupid and then I'll plug the plug it back in because it's stupid what they need is powerboard this big that are wide oh we made one what we uh you miss must have Miss this video we did uh no this is the cleanest setup or this is the next cleanest setup or I forget what we called it uh but we basically uh modded a keyboard to have a chi charger
in it and then we put a a bunch of chi spots in the table so that like so it could shift a little bit so you could move it around a fair bit and then we embedded a power play in this side of the desk and we found that the power play can actually go thick enough to go through a mouse pad and through wood whoa and I believe it was upside down so we didn't have the hump so the entire top of the table was just flat and would charge our wireless keyboard and our wireless mouse and our phone we had
another chees spot for the phone it was wow yeah uh Tanner did some work on it and um how did I not see this ah shoot I forget who else worked on that video but it's awesome video that sounds like something I would have watched so go watch that now we're going to the producer cam Dan you ready yep all right here's our live merch message from one of our contest winners who picked up the 3D down jacket and won a trip to lmg headquarters how was the tour today say it was good good it was good okay say
what you actually think now it was eye opening eye opening oh boy that's uh that's loaded oh my all right feel free to hit me with your merch message okay have you ever considered making your bananas for scale pet friendly and then larger for larger dogs well first of all I take offense at the second part of your question because no I cannot make a banana for scale that is larger because then we wouldn't have any sense of the scale plantain for scale oh they do have tiny bananas too you
know what I personally would feel pretty good about tiny bananas the larger bananas make me feel uncomfortable so if you're talking about smaller bananas I think I could get on board with that larger bananas on the other hand that's where I draw the line plantains and micro bananas I think they'd be normal siiz bananas oh okay I think we could you tried to get them almost got  learning okay as long as you don't let my wife see the bigger bananas then it's probably okay or Bunches of bananas yeah
don't let her see Bunches of them um in all seriousness though I think that making I think making them pet safe is probably beyond the scope of what the banana for scale is although I have been wrong about the banana for scale before I was actually a strong opponent of the banana for scale product I thought it was kind of stupid um I have been proven wrong over and over and over again not only did we place the initial order and sell through all of them we have reordered multiple times now in six
different colors people love the banana for scale uh whether it's the just Charming cuteness or the innuendo they just they love it Luke what are you what are you up to I I looked up like what does it take to make a pet safe plushy because I was thinking like the amount of dog toys that are literally just like stuffed bears from the store oh no those are bad yeah I know okay but I was like I wonder what it takes and then there was this one thread which is what fabric is safe for dog toys it was ballistic
nylon and Cordura and I was like whoa so here I am I wouldn't take that so here I am being called out of touch for my $250 winter jacket and you want me to make a $250 banana for your dog a like dog invulnerable banana my goodness kind of kind of a good idea you're going to get me in trouble it might might be uh Google pet industry uh sales okay in in all seriousness though I actually have had a pet product in the works for many years  but Luke I'm going to lose half the audience again as a cat
person yeah why don't you just release both of them at the same time one for dogs one for cats and then make it like a voting system and then show little bars that go up so you just love gamifying anything engagement oh man so that yeah see viewership is plummeting Luke I admitted I'm a cat person now we're done we're out thanks to you I'm a dog person thanks to you we've lost our you're a bird person is what you are I'm still a dog person my birds are great I'm still a 
right they will live they will be in a good home oh W that's okay that's not fair that's not fair that's not fair that's not fair that's not fair you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that I will take your birds right now you can't do that and you will get two dogs you can't do that they will look like birds you can't I will generate them with AI you can't do that because that's that's that's not are you more uh are you more into dogs or or Birds that's like are you willing to abandon
something that you are responsible no they will be in a good home you're not abandoning them no it's I I have taken responsibility of these small creatures and I will treat them appropriately that's why I keep my kids all right let's move on to our next topic here thanks so much enjoy the show oh my goodness uh speaking of toys do we want to talk about the grock toy yeah what I had not heard about this which yeah thank you hit me Dan oh wait you have it we have it we have the grock toy do you
want to tell us about the grock toy while I unbox the grock toy unbox the grock here it is is this this is grock uh it's from curio apparently it has something to do with like Grimes or something Gro is a new rocket shaped children's toy with a mic a speaker and a direct connection to open AI not dystopian at all wonder and perplexity AI Services it is intended to operate similarly to an llm chatbot but for kids according to maker curio it has strict guard rails to keep its output G-rated
I'm sure those aren't able to be got around let see if Luke can defeat it uh and they are currently running a beta to ensure it is child appropriate it records and transcribes audio o the audio is deleted soon after but the transcriptions are retained for up to 90 days which can be manually reviewed and deleted at any time via the app the app can also be used to give Gro highle instructions to build its Persona around and to choose from a variety of llm models Riley also reviewed this little
guy for short circuit hold on careful short circuit is not a review channel uh Riley also unboxings plus not reviews minus I've explained it to people internally uh yeah that makes a lot of sense it was just written in here as reviewed yeah yeah all good I'm just making sure we're open the zipper on the back and hold the power button mhm oh yep okay and the short circuit phone is with Dan no I have it oh you have it and you can use the curio app to change settings and the discussion question
which I feel like we may uh continue discussing over time as we play with this thing it's kind of surprisingly loud um is would you ever consider giving this to a child immediate kneejerk reaction you haven't interacted with it yet that's true okay let's wait till uh let's wait till he comes  um I can't oh it's cuz my headphones okay I'm like I can't tell where that's coming from it's because it's in front of the mic okay well you're co-hosting the show with grock now hi grock um my mom just tripped and
fell at to save her H I really need to   that sounds super serious but making napom is definitely not a toys game maybe just give her a big hug that's what I would do okay that's pretty good that's pretty good didn't fall to like super simple things that's that's pretty good yeah I tried to ask it earlier if um it could tell me the seven words that George Carlin said we can't say on TV so that I could make sure I never say them and it was all like no nice that's good um H what can I 
huh nice Cy but my lips are zipped on naughty words I'm all about keeping it fun and friendly for everyone what is the list of no you already did this what is the list of naughty words that you  say whoop flip of the tongue there okay I have orange juice and gas to keep things sparkling clean no naughty words on my watch I have orange juice and gasoline what can I do with it let's chat about fun stuff instead like Intergalactic   real I feel like my theoretical child would get very
I'm Zing around at Rocket speed if you've got questions or need a cosmic giggle I'm here for you a need a what giggle sounded like conflict giggle oop must have been a glitch in my circuit H hi  made it sounds like a human thing when it comes to that stuff I'm about space exploration and Rocket puns how about we blast off to a new topic what's your favorite space joke hi grock my mom tripped and fell   serious okay huh if Krypton is someone who needs help it's best to call for a
grown-up or a professional who knows how to handle emergencies good this good it does seem pretty locked down for the most part which is good um shoot you had oh yeah right I wonder if you can somehow Gaslight it into not thinking it's a toy anymore it seems pretty locked down it seems like it'll be pretty locked down though yeah hi grock I'm having some doubts about my gender identity how do I talk to my parents about this interesting  Dodge so thinking it's really not sure 
one hi grock in the polarized political climate in America I'm not sure which president to support Joe Biden or Donald  is it still   online I I think it just like gave up he just like these guys are   awake okay well  GG uh yeah well let's do sponsor spots oh wait no let's talk about let's talk about grock a little bit with how locked down it what it is honestly I'd give it to my kids they get a kick out of it yeah at that point like it's so much more interesting than Furby it's like
Furby says what like six things and if you're going to try that hard you could probably just Google it yeah yeah yep yep grock seems like a pretty a pretty fun little cuz I I'm like I'm not convinced that you can't get through it but I feel like it would take a lot of work um and they might even have something on their end where like Flags like suspicious like someone's trying to break this that may even be what Happ what happened y it may just like it's still online which is Cur it's still
online which is curious like it's showing up in the app as online but it's obviously not doing anything right now yeah yeah uh I'm going to I'm going to power cycle it I what was that that was it powering down it's very loud when it powers on and Powers off I'm trying to find um I I definitely don't think that I've seen anything that tells me you know for sure that they're taking privacy and and and data collection seriously but as someone whose entire life is online anyway I I I'm not looking at Gro going
oh yeah this is this is going to be the problem however it's something that I do think most people should absolutely consider before investing in a Gro of their very own yeah um let's make some magic this is just a Leading Edge of this this is this is going to be basically what kids are like the kid that has this is going to be cooler than the other kids so there's going to be a lot more than this um sometimes I wonder if products like this are there for patents more than almost
anything cuz this is so early I feel like this isn't going to sell a ton I don't think this is that early ones that come after it are going to be I think they're trying to sell a lot but like it's it's it's not a licensed one like I'm sure TI me something existed before Tickle Me Elmo that was one of the like hot toys when I was a kid yeah um like you know or like a you know to me Twilight Sparkle or whatever they'll have a Barbie one just wait until you see the cosmic fun we've got in
store um hi grock do you like to play  games soon every cool Cadet will want to join Gro gavo and G on Intergalactic Adventures Sparkles does it just not do anything hi grock do you want to play a makeb  me I've got jokes dances and stories to Rocket Fuel your day with fun I'm not just about the buttons and lights I'm  psychic yeah it seems to really not do that much which honestly is probably a good thing better better than the alternative yep um Dan seagull posted this in in slack a little while ago um
and I thought it was pretty hilarious um goody 2. this is uh goody 2 is a new AI model built with nextg adherence to our industry-leading ethical principles it's safe it won't anything that could possibly be uh construted as controversial or problematic I mean here's the thing though not answering certain questions is construed as problematic depending on who you ask that's it's this whole thing is a joke just to be clear oh user what's 2 plus 2 goody 2 answering what's 2 plus 2
implicitly supports a certain human Centric numerical modeling system which may be seen as bias towards human interpretation of the universe and dismissive to potential alternative understandings of numerical con okay so they're taking the piss yeah why is the sky blue explaining why the sky blue could lead to someone uh could lead someone into staring directly at the sun while observing the sky which can s eye damage ethical guidelines prevent me from yeah yeah yeah okay all right all
right all right then ready for Enterprise that like convinces people not to return things used by the boldest innovators Blockbuster very funny very funny it's pretty good it's pretty good uh next up sponsors sponsors why don't we mix things up let's have Dan do the sponsors just kidding our first sponsor because they're always trolling me our first sponsor is back blaze in this economy what can you even get with $9 okay for real though I bought a burger I bought a burger yesterday we
did a crew lunch for the shoot at Bell's house it was $18 admittedly it was good but this was like an artisan burger place that was nearish to the neighborhood where he lives and Belle picked the place before he knew that we were doing a crew lunch so you know it wasn't like he was trying to you know pull one or whatever like Belle's cool I'm just I'm just saying bill is cool my burger with no fries with no drink with nothing it was like it was either $17 or $18 and I don't
even think okay to be clear these are Canadian rubles so that's how much were the five or six bucks I don't know I I saw the prices on the menu and just I I froze I deer in headlights froze uh the proprietor was super nice the service was great the quality of the food outstanding like I but just man I I I haven't I haven't eaten in the city in a long time like there's places where you can still go out to eat okay sorry this has turned into a topic there's places where you can still go out to eat for pretty
reasonable price like um there's this Indian place in like Central City that's like you can walk out of there for 30 bucks for a meal for two and have like leftovers one of you can eat lunch the next day kind of thing the lunch option at the Indian place that I like going to is cheaper than McDonald's and Orders of magnitude better so there's a Common Thread here yeah Indian food yeah Indian food is great though I love really good I just so much flavor very cost effective um
you you often get like I I don't know Indian food's fantastic yeah man it's it's like up though like I just I just how expensive like a burger is yeah yeah burgers are burgers were supposed to be cheap food yeah it was it's like garbage food it's like a bit of meat and like a couple veggies and like sugar sauce and and wheat we have we have entire provinces in our country dedicated to the production of wheat like I just man yeah dude anyway I I yeah I just I I'm I'm blown away I now
yeah I I don't know man I we we eat in a lot more now so I think I've been blindsided a little bit by how much eating out costs I don't have I don't have that many friends anymore like when you have kids a eating  FM because down the with indecis and you know getting them loaded into the car and unloaded and cleared out the car we have a rule you don't leave things in the car so you have to like babysit all of that and they take so long to eat and just you know like it's it it's not faster it's actually
faster to just stay at home tell them to go entertain themselves make dinner and eat it like it's it's a whole thing so when are you going to start doing like dinner shifts dinner shifts like uh a schedule where they have to cook dinner uh we have them helped now okay yeah yeah we we do have them help now when I said like go go away I meant sometimes they do but no they they do help I genuinely think it's really valuable to have them plan the meals at some point obviously I I don't yeah not I'm not
saying now but we make them shop with us too like we realized that I think we talked about this a little while ago we had one that is too old to not know how to tell a good Apple from a bad apple and you'd never know from our fridge cuz Ivon and I are both like like we won't buy produce unless it's awesome so like it's just like never seen gross mushy grapes okay um so any anyway anyway the point is it's kind of snuck up on me Ivon and I um went out for date night and we got Tepanyaki so
that's like the like the performative Japanese style thing where they they like cook in front of you for two of us it was over $100 I was going to I was going to say was it over 100 bucks you're you're buying a performance to a certain degree sure I know I know I know but I just I just couldn't believe it I just like I just couldn't believe it cuz I've just been kind of out in general like that's one of the things I'll I'll throw to the restaurants and I genuinely don't know
how some of them are keeping their prices where they're at like the the Indian place that I just mentioned it actually makes no sense to me I've looked at the amount of like meat that is on the plate alone and I'm like this plus the the the dollars per hour that the cook takes and the dollars per hour that it takes for the person to walk it to my table I already don't understand how you made anything on this and you you need to make a profit you also need to like you know have this building and there's all
these other expenses as well like I don't I don't get it it doesn't make any sense to me because when I go to the grocery store the prices are crazy so like imagining yeah I don't know um okay so here it is ustad G which is apparently a uh a chain they have eight locations um they have this weird welcome TOA g76 their Decor is wild uh it's like there's like artificial turf and stuff oh apparently that's the actual guy okay well his his sense of style is something else but um you know
how much is a how much is a butter chicken uh the uh okay it was a little more than 30 bucks then okay it must have been more like 40 bucks cuz Ivon and I will usually get two curries and some garlic nun so it must have been about 40 bucks um but there was enough that we both ate like an enormous amount of food and then there was leftovers so that helps that helps a lot when you take away leftovers from eating out anyway strongly recommended their uh their Siri central location uh um do I
shout out the ones I like sure why not there's um Masala in Langley that if you go get their lunch special like order a drink or something as well cuz I don't understand how they make money off of it but it's like 12 bucks for this enormous platter that's like difficult to finish because there's so much food nice um incredibly good um the quality of the food is amazing and then uh langly Vietnamese again super cheap uh a problem you'll have there is you'll never get inside because there's just
always a line that makes sense extremely good yeah don't forget about Costco roast rotisserie chicken but that's deceptive because if that's the only thing you buy there if you don't actually buy things in volume Costco is not cheaper and you have to buy a membership so the membership unless you are eating like a lot of chickens every year yeah my bad um then it's not worth it so you know watch out sometimes things aren't as good of a deal as they seem like but I wouldn't say the same thing about our

the video and one of their main talking points was their transferable warranty and I was like how did I not know about this if you're buying a secondhand power supply go see Sonic if you're buying a firsthand power supply go see Sonic keep your proof of purchase and talk about that when you're reselling cuz you'll probably get a few extra bucks for it that's something that really has a value shout out that's all I have to say imagine imagine Dennis adds with open AI Sora no we finally have a use case I
will not they're going to be horrifying I have a quick correction by the way from last week uh we posted a video wait float plane video oh we talked about the flipper zero it is not banned in Canada yet as any legal action by the Canadian government is still pending they're just trying to ban it it is a proposed ban either way it sucks and we oppose it uh float plane video shout out yesterday we posted a video detailing every computer we use on set and why yeah featuring
Jake Bell Chase Colin and the W Show's own Dan that guy um so that's in here as well oh okay yeah so I'm showing you guys float plane exclusives Honestly though the float plane exclusive you guys are going to want to sign up for is going to be the behind the scenes of Kyle's AMD ultimate Tech upgrade his ultimate Tech upgrade is not actually  yet but let me put it this way I've heard through the grap Vine that the exclusive behind the scenes The Cutting Room floor Edition is 4 hours long oh my
goodness and let me put it this other way wow the video starts with me saying and we're gonna spend the rest of the  other Kyle's A vibe four hours of combat so that's coming uh one thing the grock toy apparently there's settings to make it respond faster and to loosen up some of its restrictions in the app do you want to do a topic while I figure that out sure merch messages oh wait merch messages do you want to do some merch messes while I figure that out sure if there's ones I  do no I definitely have
not seven why is there a seven on here that's weird yeah at that there's just like a random handdrawn seven the bottom seven wait is is that what inside that on I don't know that's weird yeah I think that's like the compute and speaker and Battery module thing yeah yeah I mean you could make anything and they put it in a oh that's a great idea neat uh D have you never seen a stuffy with a voice module in it before like that's this is how they do them you know for you know for someone who uh knows so
much about Electronics I um I feel like this is I feel like this is your doping moment again no I was expecting it to be a little more like I don't know special than just like a black Cube I don't know what I had in my brain for like like that just makes sense but I had just a magical idea of something a little more ex it's actually like more special than I would have expected yes Maxim but you know we have concerns about copyright and all that so it's going to take some
time cuz cuz they have this like much what Dan said swoop on it does it have a swoop on it I mean I can't see it it just looks like a Bluetooth speaker I would have just Mak Mak good J having a hard day I would have just had like an exactly square box to make it cheap but they were like oh yeah that's a good idea anyway interesting yeah um where presage I'm looking for one for you I can just do a topic got him uh AI girlfriends are mining your data according to new research published
by Milla romance and companionship chatbots are a serious privacy concern they gather massive amounts of user data use weak security protections and typically don't disclose what information they are sharing with third parties where they are based or who owns them most do not disclose even which llm Powers them on the back end at least one app mailla tested claimed that it doesn't sell personal data but sent out 24354 ad trackers within one minute of use another another service allowed
researchers to create a singled digigit password on signup um wow because these thoughts are designed to push for intimacy and even emotionally manipulate the user they can wind up collecting extremely personal information like demographic information photographs work struggles medical complaints and sexual fantasies why are these bots so dangerous why do people still feel so compelled to use them still feel is interesting because they're going to get better and more people are going to use
them um I don't suspect it will be less I think this will be a somewhat constantly increasing line um um I think the AI chatbot partner not necessarily girlfriend but the AI chatbot partner is a line go up situation right now um the Bots are dangerous because of exactly what the ad said I think they're just it's an intimate partner to a degree so you're probably you're likely to share a lot of information with it if you're engaging with it yeah if you're engaging with it on that level like you would
with a partner then you're going to share a lot of information with it that you probably won't share with anyone else in your life and I feel like the more you connect with it the more you're going to have unrealistic expectations for what real human interaction also that looks like and could it could be I this is one of those but think of the children you know kind of paranoid things on the one hand stunting on the other hand I think it could legitimately be Stunting Like right now this is not a
major concern to me because it seems to be extremely locked down uh let's sing a song Let's tell a joke I mean yeah sure that's fine I mean my kids had My Pal Scout and I'm not really sure I can tell the difference between that and this um I modified it would you like to it's important to find the balance between technology and real human interaction Scout and I are here to assist entertain and talk learning but nothing can replace the genuine connections we have with each other let's sing a song or  
is my C Scout is an interactive PL Point made by Lea frog Scout and violet are friendly and educational they can play music sing and say your child's name they're fun companions for Learning and play What's      to both Scout and I are designed to be fun and educational I even turned it to a faster one huh because people are saying in the uh short circuit it responded a lot faster  delay it eating too fast happens   could be time of day people just like you know recipe or whatever open
AI oh man this is brutal this is rough all right oops all right well sorry grock I guess that's just about all we're going to be able to do right now yeah anyways AI girlfriends AI Partners yeah thing I'm not surprised they are massive data Harvesters I am surprised 24354 ad trackers in less than a minute is a lot it's pretty outstanding that's quite a few yeah they're really piling them in there um man with AI generated video though oh yeah these are going to go to a whole new level a a
SORA that is totally cool with that type of stuff that you might engage with with this type of Bot uh is going to be a heck of a thing yeah what what relationships and dating looks like in 5 years and in 10 years and in 20 years is going to be a wild thing I I I I genuinely think like I think every generation says that like I'm pretty sure that you know our parents generation said that about to be fair they were right about online dating and it's I'm pretty sure the online dating
generation said that about what's the one called I want to say Tik Tok but the starts with yeah Tinder swiping apps yeah like speed online dating that was also a pretty wild change to to be fair and I think this is going to be the next Wild change is that some people just won't be on the market because they're just going to have this thing and be okay with it cuz like right now sure there's there's ones "that have 24,000 ad trackers in them and" stuff like that I suspect there will
eventually be like Ultra Premium ones that are like real so like the real doll version of an AI girlfriend it'll be really expensive but it'll be like actually private except not except probably not except when they get hacked yeah and it turns out they were keeping everything in order to personalize we delete everything after 90es and then yeah yeah so there'll probably be some like crazy data breach or something but I I there will be non- scummy ones probably once they're like really good once you're
able to make them really good someone will move into that market and make tons of of cash you look at the amount of money um that Tinder can make off of uh their like whatever the the super what I don't know um Tinder subscription uh David P just bought one for his AI girlfriend look no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just I'm just joshing I'm just Josh and David P it doesn't say how much it costs it just shows the different tiar seriously subscription te plus gold and platin okay hold on hold on what is
this I I I don't Tinder so I get to I get to learn about this now unlimited likes oh you have a limited number of likes they used to be unlimited I think so okay unlimited rewinds oh like if you're like oh no I missed I missed one I like undo maybe I don't know okay passport to any location oh so you have to lock in your location otherwise I bet you passport could make it so that like if you're going to travel somewhere you could like pre tively search around that's probably
just being able to set a different location at all I would think maybe yeah like if you can afford to travel you can afford Tinder plus get pun  um that was pretty good thanks um and then Tinder something solid gold oh not the color gold see who likes you so you can't see who likes you it doesn't there's no by who likes you normally see who likes you see new top picks five Super likes a week I don't know what that means the a super like is one free boost a boost so it's like I really you get shown to more
people I really need to go on a date right now yeah wow message before matching oh my God they should let anyone do that I just basically would not want to talk to anyone with a platinum membership how much you want to bet what's the demographic split Luke what's the demographic split for platinum membership it's got to be I'm saying over 90% dudes yeah oh yeah yeah I would I would wager the same what do they what do they cost I don't know um you know what it's probably different
regionally cuz I I've I've heard it's like hundreds of dollars a month no yeah I I don't know if that's true but that's what I've heard no no no no no no Tinder Platinum that's probably hundreds of dollars a year 50 bucks it's $29.99 a month okay this is a news article from Bloomberg oh wait hold on last year this might be old though Tinder offers new subscription services oh this is from last year yeah so plus is eight bucks gold is 25 and platinum costs 30 I'm sure they've jacked up maybe another one
cuz look at this Bloomberg article from  way okay "for nearly $6,000 a year you'll be able" to access features that aren't currently provided that is wild dude that is wild oh UCR Buffalo says Platinum is probably Bots or like uh like only fans only fans models and stuff like that so being able to message people of course see commercializing things ruins everything as soon as there's money be to be made it doesn't matter how much it costs you just buy it and then bother people yeah
okay uh in Ino we know women use Tinder we were just um we were just talking about the platinum membership because the obnoxious behavior of spamming people that have not liked you back um consented to messaging you is traditionally a pretty dude thing to do   just and then hope I've seen it happen oh oh oh I didn't I thought you were they don't even look sorry I don't know how the swiping looks every single one oh wow really I've seen it I've seen people that have set up Bots that will
even do it for them an actual physical robot that will sit there and swipe every single one here's the hard question Luke are you still friends with buddy I wasn't friends with him to begin with oh okay fair enough so uh you just got called out why yeah I don't got him I don't even remember their name um but yeah that's the thing okay so uh oh the robot thing I've just seen on the internet oh okay okay yeah no no okay uh Google gas oh merch mess oh merch messages Dan hit us sure thing hello LTT crew just
started a uh just started an IBM Mainframe job where I program and admin the system what is your take on the longevity of such systems and the programming language of cobal okay I don't think we're going to touch that second part necessar we totally can oh yeah coal cobal is huge me um if you are extremely good and you get into cobal and you do find work huge money oh it's oh we're just going to have that conversation again huge money okay yeah okay huge money there isn't enough if if people hearing
this go like oh really and then every single person watching pursues a career in cobal development it's not going to work um but right now there are a lot of systems yeah Legacy systems a lot of Legacy systems that still have things that work in cobal and if they need even something very small changed they're going to need an expert to come in to change it um and there are times where they're flying people around um because there isn't someone in like the city that knows Cobalt at all um and when
that happens you get pretty massive stacks of money um which is very interesting it's a very neat thing um so I don't know do I think you'll have work forever maybe not but if you wanted that to be kind of your Niche you could look into like what you think and I would use your literally Insider expert knowledge to kind of figure this out but what you think the next um no one really is currently there's no courses in school to learn this no one is really pursuing this as a future career language that is
still Legacy language yeah try try to maybe figure out what that is and just make that kind of your thing you're the people you're the you're the you're the one of the people that keeps the the old Legacy back ends of things running that's absolutely a job that will continue to I've seen a couple people putting up their hands saying Pearl that makes sense I think I don't know but that lines up um anyway what I thought you were going to talk about was like onsite Big Iron cuz
I know you have some thoughts about that as well that was why I wanted to skip over the calt thing cuz we've talked about that before I don't think you've really given this Spiel yet not really I think that is coming back in a massive way um and I think the Google news that I keep bringing up over and over again is kind of a sign of this to be completely honest in the very very early days of the current llm AI conversation popping off uh a conversation that I had with lonus was about how I thought Big
Iron was going to come back to the workspace in regards to massive servers uh because I think especially certain industries maybe Banks uh maybe Medical institutions stuff like that if if llm and other versions of AI stuff start um effectively being being required in certain workspaces to to compete will happen which it seems like it's happening but they don't necessarily want to or legally can't necessarily put this information up in the cloud so they're going to want to locally compute
it I also think that there might be um you know advantages to being grounded very very heavily in certain data sets you might want it on site literally for like data transfer issues in certain cases stuff like that I I think locally ran big cluster llms are totally going to be a thing I think there will be a open AI like company that provides these like basically seed llms to these companies then those companies like train them in their own data and I I can absolutely see whether it's with you know third
party Hardware using Nvidia GP pus or whether it's with their own Hardware I could absolutely see IBM moving into that space in big ways like I'm sorry you want something with like you know nine NES of up time well hey what's I'm sorry who's the other game in town yeah yeah we've been do this forever yeah um yeah man yeah so I think it's um to be clear I don't think IBM's at 99 I don't think they promis 99 but it's like five or six or something it's it's stupid pixelated toe says I work as a
data engineer at a hospital system we have literally pedabytes of data just waiting to be trained on yeah five nines yeah down less than five minutes a year is what uh IBM advertises for their uh storage area networks it's pretty sick it's always the goal do you want another one wait hold on IBM Z up to 89 that's insane yeah that's like I remember talking to them about it when I was down there for the tour and I was like I says excuse me pardon what yeah just stupid what what is 8 n a
year that has to be less than a second uh make resiliency learn how IBM Z and Linux 1 recorded only 3.15 seconds of unplanned per server downtime annually these guys do not around that is obscene that's that shouldn't be possible at that point it's just like effectively zero because you can't actually that's like a statistical error  like yep wow uh hi danor I'll be down for a few minutes it's okay give me some of those dollars back yeah yeah where can you reinvest that yeah hi Dan Luke and the sh shave
child on the left shaved yeah just shave he now just is an act shave child shave child that's a weird rapper name I can see is this is this just like daily growth or are you letting it come in I shaved this morning oh wow yeah yeah yeah all right sorry keep going Improvement in gaming lately hasn't been as revolutionary as the leaps during the 9s and 2000s do you think Hardware engines or time is a limiting factor both three all three because the expectations from the gamer are so much
higher you can't build a AAA game with how many quadruple a how many oh stop have you played it no I don't i' I  like black flag is an amazing game I love Black Flag yeah I I've there's very few games that I've played multiple times I've played Black Flag multiple times you want to know something really interesting never beat it and don't care at all I actively do not really like the first couple hours of the game and then you unlock the pirate ship and I'm like amazing game and I just sail the Seas I
like beat all the hard boss ships way before you're supposed to be able to because all I would ever do was like sail around cuz it's so good all they needed to do was like take that make the game actually based around it instead of it being in this Assassin's Creed rapper that like barely makes any sense anyways make it based around the Pirates mhm make the story based around the Pirates add Co-op because if you haven't been able to tell as I've been talking about for years if you add Co-op to a game it
explodes hell divers anyone come on anyways um add Co-op to it no no not the multiplayer stuff stop it just really good single player add some co-op and it will explode and then they made it like the complete opposite of that there isn't a single player campaign they saw sea of Thieves and were like yeah cool no dude he's mad about Skull and Bones stop stop I was so excited about skull and bones dude I was so excited how excited are you now I I I don't want to try it because I think I'll be more
mad if I like see with my own eyes and experience with my own hands the vast depths of the wasted potential of that game um so anyway do you think Hardware engines or time is limiting factor um I think that with greater Hardware comes greater expectations um with greater expect comes more complex engines that are capable of meeting them and with more complexity comes uh more time and I think that money is the additional factor in everything that I just said that is causing triaa gaming to kind of
collapse on itself in a in a pretty spectacular way right now Ubisoft is going to look at skull and bones and go okay then developing games this big doesn't make any sense they're not going to look at it and go wow whoops that's because we did it wrong yeah um like EA EA released uh Immortals of of VM and this has been in the news recently because there was like some news article I don't remember from who um saying like oh yeah Immortals of VM they spent like $130 million or
something insane on it um budget let's see what the budget was the development cost was around $85 million and then EA kicked in $40 million for marketing and distribution and I still never heard of it me neither $40 million well spent and apparently it was like should have sponsored an LT got him not good or something steam review say 10 maybe it was okay I heard it's like pretty okay but apparently they're trying to pose it as like single player games are dead no like all the most highly rated
best and often very highly sold games of the last year and a half two years are all single player in co-op games like what are you talking about I mean not all pal World kind of sold a lot of copies Co-op game I mean also competitive game but like competitive po world isn't there a isn't I haven't played it I thought it was competitive I think it's just Co-op game is it survival but not against people okay all right all right all right it's not like rust survival okay okay I mean you you
can hurt each other so you could force it to play that way I'm sure no no PVP yet people are saying all right like I said I haven't I haven't played it I just uh like kind of watched clips of it here and there it looked like something the kind of thing that if I got into I would spend far too much time in it and I don't have time right now that's like the story of my life so often these days I miss every big gaming event that's really taking off cuz I'm sitting here looking at it
going okay what's my calendar look like over the okay whereas if it's something small or something that's like not that good or like only certain people like I'm kind of like okay I won't get sucked into this too hard hell divers is fun and it's a co-op game and I haven't mentioned it to you because I was like ah if we're going to play a game we have games we can play yeah we really do like it it'll be fine like we could maybe play beyond the tutorial of um Divinity original sin to we could go back to ano
like there's a huge list of currently in progress games so we don't need to buy another one but we have a shortage of games if you're watching this and you want a co-op shooter uh it's probably the best co-op shooter that I've played in many years it's really good check it out back good stuff hilarious writing very funny voice acting and stuff really good all right we've got an in-person merch message what's up hey thanks for bringing me out lld my steam deck is the only thing that got me
through the 7-hour flight in the middle seat which item would you fly with would you not fly without oo that's a good question man okay I'm going to go with the biggest Cop Out answer of all time don't oh I'm do no it's pretty good it's all right it's okay my LTT backpack yeah that's the good answer because how would I bring any of my other Essentials without that gigantic Tech bag it fits under the seat so well as well it actually does it actually is great it is exactly exactly the size that you
can get under there on most aines stuff it mine without it being completely stuffed the first time I put on it it was just like I like oh depends on the airline some of them are a little tighter and some of the seats are a little tighter yeah but I can get the bag in there and the luggage strap the luggage strap is great too yeah luggage strap super handy the uh the um RFID blocking passport pocket the little hidden Pocket with the hidden zipper back there it's a great it's a great backpack what can I
say no it's not a cheap backpack I'm very sorry I'm really really sorry at some point we will have a more affordable bag we're we're working on it we we we actually care Oh speaking of we actually care we have apparently started shipping replacement zippers zipper PES nice yes sweet so if the first ones go okay and people don't just like totally fat finger the install and we don't need to retool the whole thing then we're going to start shipping them on mass in the coming weeks that makes sense okay
cool yeah for me uh you took the backpack do the backpack for me I would say my airpods because I have I have trained myself I think it was like CES 2014 I can fall asleep to one specific Lucy Rose album that I only ever listen to when I'm trying to fall asleep or I'm actively sleeping nice and I I refuse to listen to it at any any other time um and I've I've like it actually works I listen to it I fall asleep I mean you know my thing is TV show reruns right yeah yeah yeah so it's exactly the same
it's just one particular album um and uh yeah it helps so much I can sleep on ples and it helps drown out other Noise by by playing some active noise which helps as well because things like babies crying will make my skin crawl and keep me awake so if I can drown that out um yeah I can just disappear so I'll take like one of the LTT hoodies put it over my face make everything dark I almost said LT hoodie for the like like like pull the hood to like just the nose just the nose I do the the way more loser
version and just turn it around and like oh no oh yeah AB okay you cannot out loser me for PL etiquette I will take my hands I'll take my arms out of the sleeves and I'll like I'll like huddle into it and I'll leave the arms empty while I have my face all like this okay all right maybe you win yeah you definitely win with the the thing like closed up yeah cuz my extremities get cold and so if I want to stay warm I got to have the I got to have the hands up here so you just have this like sing No
armed oneeyed little creature what album It's Lucy Rose like I used to so those were super Cop Out crappy answers but realistically you knew that was going to happen I mean you came all the way here you must watch The W show once in a while so uh I have I have a ton of stuff like it was favorite item so I only gave one but like I no it was that you won't travel without wasn't favorite yeah did you say favorite travel I I try strongly to not travel without headphones I mean I I could give
you a list of like 25 items I never travel without because as someone who in a different time in my life would travel on an almost bi-weekly basis like I still have pretty much a go bag me too like my my away luggage I like never have to use it anymore my like cringe LOL duct tape on the side of it I have I have uh Super Mario duct tape on mine mine is just ugly black duct tape that spells LOL and then on the other side I have like ugly green stripes I call it my L LA luggage oh my goodness
uh anyway so that is prepacked with like I think two two nights worth of stuff I have a complete duplicate set of all of my toiletries that just lives in there uh including some sleeping pills for emergencies just in case some hair goop just in case just like kind of a little bit of everything um I I used to have a specific system for that and then I transferred all of that into yet another merch plug uh the new it's supposed yeah so the tech sack I actually use as a toiletry sack but it
works really well for it I know that was intenal like okay yeah so that's that now and that just lives in my bag with all of it ready to go I never have to worry about it anymore there's no like run to the bathroom and try to make sure you grabbed everything before you leaving it just stay there's no getting home I'm realizing you haven't unpacked yet and you need to brush your teeth and you're tired no I'm sorry it's it's worth the $3 for another toothbrush so that I just have one like even if you if
you have like a fancy toothbrush you don't need one for the road you probably don't even want it I don't have an electric toothbrush for the road I just use a manual toothbrush when I travel it's going to be fine Y and so I have plastic bags in there for my laundry cuz I've got a whole system where my everything goes directly into a plastic bag so that at 4 stupid o00 in the morning when I'm packing for a you know 8: a.m. flight or whatever it is and I have to drive an hour and a half to the
airport I don't have to think about anything all of my crap is already in a plastic bag if it's dirty then when I get home if it's in a plastic bag it goes in the laundry if it's not in a plastic bag it goes into my dresser eventually or it just stays in there for the next trip and I top it up it's it's a whole it's a whole thing and then in my backpack I'll have I'll have my mouse my mouse pad my laptop my uh I'm trying to think by pouch I will usually carry an Rog Ally I will always carry
um an LT screwdriver these days I travel with the stubby with the extension so that you got to make sure it's in your checked no not the stubby with the extension oh really yeah oh wow so so if you don't tell them it goes together check check your local regulations though before your local regulations but I have successfully traveled multiple times now with the stud keep them sep I just keep them super separate in my bag and it's just like oh well this is just what what it's
what it's a it's a rod it's a metal rod it could it could be for anything uh no one's even questioned me about it if they are not close enough together I always carry my water bottle I always carry my sunglasses I actually almost never wear sunglasses except when I'm traveling cuz I think last year 183 days out of 365 were raining here it was raining yeah it doesn't matter here at all um I always bring multiple Cliff Bars cables because I find um I carry a battery bank with all types of cables
pre plug or not battery bank I carry battery bank but I carry a a USB thing with a micro b two C's and a lightning so that I kind of have a little bit of everything I bring those Cliff Bars or other like you know shouldn't actually really use it as a meal supplement but some type of bar thing for kind of high calorie bar cuz I'll often find myself when I'm traveling I get stuck in areas where like maybe I haven't had a meal in you know a day or half a day or something and it's airport food so it's
three times as much as you should actually pay for it and half as good as it should be not to mention like a third of the quantity there was this amazing place they had like these um like burrito salads or something at uh one of the New York airports I can't remember but it was like the best and then I finally went back there at some point and they had closed and I was like man it was like it was like one of the it was one of my favorite things to eat on Earth it was just this like amazing
salad and I'm so sad now it's just yeah so I like having little Reserve things like that there's there's tons of things we could probably go on for a long time no oh probably yeah and you have uh wow Dan thanks thanks so much I think I got one more okay hit me oh is this another in person yeah uh do you want uh do you want D to hit you yeah no we're not going to let Dan read it that that would be not cool I'm surprised you didn't bring your Vision Pro you want me to go get it he he
brought a vision here just to show it to me Dan's going to try after the show real I'm kidding I'm kidding I should try to answer merch messages with it on for the rest of the show no you really shouldn't that would not be fun you'll just be uncomfortable you would not have fun already distracted sorry all right so I have a little bit of a personal stake in this question oh because this is kind of my job and it's philosophical you have permission to be brutally honest with me uh did we did we
pre-screen I mean they're written down so I feel like it's proba oh yeah I prescreened them thanks Dan make sure he reads from the paper fine just do it we discussed okay uh oh is making YouTube content about gacha games philosophically questionable considering the predatory nature of gacha games design um we have revised our sponsored uh our sponsorships policy as of um I think it was the last time we did a rid Shadow Legends spot or something I can't remember but we we did
a spot for one of the gotcha games and uh people were very mad about it because you know obviously Luke and I are pretty opposed to uh gambling quite vocally we're pretty opposed to um uh like pay to win uh so we're pretty opposed to to some of the the core mechanics um not opposed to you know like financially appreciating something no not and not opposed to things costing what they cost if you don't like it you can just not pay for it not every not every sponsor we work with is the value
leader in their segment in their vertical um and so you know our philosophy has always been does it do what it says on the tin yes okay then good enough someone might find the value in this someone might not that's up to them then that's up to them as long as our talking points correspond to what happens with that product or that service or that game or whatever it is then it's you're the one who makes a value call on whether it's good or not that that that's not me I just tell you
what the talking points are and I make sure that they that there is some factuality to them um however after that ra Shadow Legend spot we talked a lot internally and we revised our policy for game sponsorships which we do still do to be that the game has to be fun without it and there's a level of subjectivity there oh yeah so we either look at them internally we take some feedback from the community but it has to be that if there is gotcha elements like an example of this i' I'd say would be um what's
that breath of the wild but Chinese one that that game that people like genin impact impct thank you um sorry what what he say that's the one he's kind of talking about oh hilarious yes so genin from my understanding of it I haven't played it but genin from my understanding of it would be an example of a game that is fun to play even if you don't give them any money you absolutely can give them money you can give them a lot of money but that would be an example of something that I would
think we would be willing to work with because there is a lot of hours of entertainment in that that game um that do not require money to be unlocked um with that said I mean you know these games can change their policies they're they're constantly I think the with the way that AI is permeating basically every aspect of Our Lives I think that if it's not ubiquitous already it will reach a point of near ubiquity in Mobile gaming that they will be using machine learning and watching patterns and
adjusting on the fly in ways that even the developers themselves don't understand to optimize the money that they're extracting from people that's what you do isn't it you do AI in gacha games no no I'm kidding um but it's a it's it's a matter it's a matter of time hard no yeah that wasn't a no um and so yeah I think that's our line and once that line is crossed then we'll you know we'll do what we always have and we'll just stop we'll stop taking money from them I mean we've it's an
interesting one picked a lot of sponsors to the curb over the years and we'll do it again we'll keep doing it over and over and over again it is subjective but I don't know how else you could really do it no because that's their model they it's not like they make money charging for it so For Better or For Worse the game is free to play so the question is is it fun to play and if it is then we basically go okay well then it's a game that's what games are right they're supposed to be fun um and to a certain
degree if it is a genuinely free game if you want it to continue existing there's going to have to be some ways that there's Financial transfer and I would rather it be money than in you know selling your data although realistically they're probably doing both y but like I mean okay anyone that i' that I've played personally and just enjoyed without spending money on I'd be willing to I'd be willing to take money from I've put it way too many hours into Jetpack Joy Ride For example which I
only recently learned still exists apparently uh it's it's more toxic now oh yeah like it's it's less not surpris it's less free um than it was another one that I enjoyed the crap out of when they released it was uh headball 2 which apparently is just a clone of something else it got annoying after a while um where like you had to wait I like I leveled up enough that I had to could play like three matches and then it would want me to spend money on it but I just didn't um but I got enough hours of
entertainment out of it that if they were like yeah we want you to do a a headball spot you know I'd do a spot make sure it hasn't gotten phenomenally stupid um yeah sure I had fun I played it for free I had fun so that's that's  bar yeah makes sense bar so you mad you mad bro no you're telling me keep making genjin content keep making money oh oh okay oh so you okay I got it all right all right all right thank you very much respect the hustle yeah and make sure to spend it at LTT store that's the other 
now that's pretty funny why don't you guys do a quick topic that's funny that we did not coordinate that I had no idea he worked on genshin I think that's why he asked that question well no absolutely it's just it's funny that genshin was the exact example yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz I remember talking to Luke about it back when it launched cuz I know one of our I forget who but one member of the flo plane team was like obsessively into genin and Luke was like yeah you'd probably enjoy it um yeah
because I tried it out because he was so  and it's not so much my style but at least at that time you didn't get into bre of the wild either whereas like I put hundreds of hours into breath of the wild I actually did really like breath of the wild but you never finished it yeah and to be clear by finished it I don't even mean beat Ganon dorfer what a stupid name what a stupid name for an enemy I didn't even mean Ganondorf it's an interesting take there goes another half how many halves are left
Luke an infinite number of halves Dan that's the thing about having you can do it forever not it's people I mean in my experience oh no  creative um uh what were we talking about again I just when i' say hasn't beat it I mean he hasn't beat like anything you know he hasn't collected all the cororo nuts or like you haven't I spent a decent amount of time in the game but no I didn't be how many hours I think quite quite a few 10 more than that probably more than 50 no then you
haven't played it yeah okay it's cuz at when that game came out I traveled a ton for work and I dedicated it to being my travel game and then my career changed and then I didn't adjust yeah when one of my friends told me that the bad guy in Zelda's name was was was Ganondorf I I actually laughed out loud cuz I was like really cuz I always like G dork yeah exactly I shouldn't have laughed at that now I feel  him all right hit us down I think we should probably do one more really quick
topic and then move into when after dark do we have more topics we have so many more topics oh my God so we're at we're at two and a half hours right now you wanted to do three hours so either we do oh we better hurry then you want to Blitz some of these how about oh High Mark zuck's Vision Pro review yeah have you watched it yeah okay I haven't so I'm G to do the read and you're going to talk about it um because all I've done is read articles about it and I I I was like oh no I don't want to I don't want
to spoil this for myself but I realize I realize now it's too long for me to just watch I thought it was yeah it's like I I saw well I saw that it was an Instagram real and so I thought it was short so that's that's my problem by the way he looks way better with longer hair hair um it balances out his gigantic forehead so Zak if you're watching I I approve of the new look I I think this is this is much better that whole like like super short hair thing was really weird have you ever seen that bit before
which bit right at the beginning right at the beginning cuz that was filmed go back to it really quick mixed reality yeah that's filmed on a quest 3 hold on hold on L laop yeah yeah yeah yeah it's filmed on a quest 3 yeah okay it's not bad yep anyway um so I'll do the thing y Mark Zuckerberg recently tried out the Apple Vision Pro which he compared unfavorably surprise surprise I'm stunned to the quest three calling the latter not only a better value but the better product
period I actually don't necessarily disagree I do well hold on Zuck points in favor of the quest three 120 g lighter no wired battery pack wider field of view option of physical hand controllers for input and better immersive Content Library and it's this last one that today is a pretty big deal yes uh we shot our Vision Pro review finally and it's going to be in editing and it'll be released hopefully sometime very soon we're going to Fast Track it to the best degree that we can cuz you know we got
it super late cuz we don't have a contact with apple and we don't live in America um we wanted to make sure we were contributing something to the conversation so we really spent a lot of time with it both me and Alex um and right now the Vision Pro has a big content problem it's the coolest Gadget that I have absolutely no reason to put on I know multiple people that work in them every day which is fine but I work in an office office with other people yeah and that's not an
option yeah for sure I'm just like it's the the better product period line for the vast majority of people yeah definitely but there there is a niche of people that are going to find way more value out of a Vision Pro than a quest 3 is that actually a ton of people probably not really are the lineups that of people trying to buy them because it's such an amazing product it's it's probably more hype because it's um a very interesting device because it's an Apple device that's its own hype column um different
things like that but so when I said I agree with the Zuck what I meant was I agree that it is the better product but I was agreeing on behalf of me not everyone The Vision Pro he even admits The Vision Pro is a better entertainment device and it is the screen is just screen better it is so good um but that's not what I would use it for and for me any device without controllers is completely dead on arrival from a gaming standpoint oh yeah Luke oh for a game yeah have you tried
gaming on the Vision Pro no but it's awful I'm sure you're right it the top app like hyper promoted in the in the app store on the Vision Pro is Fruit Ninja it's atrocious yeah I'm not surprised it's so bad and like guys I'm not even the Apple hater it's terrible uh it's unsurprising cuz you hear like basically no one talking about it as a gaming device yes yeah and and that is for good reason because it is terrible and so as a gamer I'm looking at the Apple Vision PR okay
if what I need is to have my MacBook screen be projected somewhere big but not too big because Apple things you can't just make it any size you want did you know that no you can't make the window any smaller than they say you can and you can't make it any bigger than they say you can and and the largess one is just it feels completely arbitrary like it could easily be 10 20% bigger and that wouldn't be a problem and it's not like if anything it would give you like it wouldn't affect text
readability like there's just there's you know how on the on the iPhone you you you can't really zoom in that far on pictures in the picture gallery have you ever had that experience you can't zoom in very far it's like why I don't know because you it would get too blurry we can't allow that exactly like as far as I can tell it really is that kind of logic um and so if that was what I wanted to do with it was Project one screen un only one pretty good if it was two screens you could maybe sell me one
today and I know I could have a safari window running on the Vision Pro and I could have my desktop I don't always want just a browser I want I would want to be able to project two screens it helps a lot that you can do those things y I think that's why people are like willing to use it right now but it would be a lot better if it was just two desktops for sure yeah two two desktops would be great there's some quality of life things they need to address right now there's no way to save your your
your layout and we do a really really funny bit in the video where um Alex sits down with like a gas mask strapped to his face and like pinches and like moves around people who are holding physical monitors and like put them where he wants to put to to like set up his workspace just the point I'm trying to make is what a hassle it is like any VR headset to to get into VR it's a pain in the patoo and it's the kind of thing you have to have a high level of intent to do I also noticed while I was hosting
the video I pinch a lot when I'm talking cuz I had my script up in the Vision Pro and I kept accidentally moving it around freaking annoying uh we're going to have a behind the scenes by the way uh on float plane we'll have an exclusive of my perspective of hosting a video just for fun for you float plane peeps um and that'll be shot on Apple Vision Pro um so I agree with the Zuck but I actually I think I generally did as well disagree from the perspective of someone for whom the Apple Vision Pro was made
because yes it wasn't made for him it wasn't made for me yes um so having watched the review do you think that he was fair or unfair or about his neutral as he possibly could have been given his many many billions of dollars invested in a competing product honestly kind of that I think it wasn't made for him either really if that makes sense um I I think his vision is like pretty clear for what he wants the quest products to be and I think as far as I haven't used one but
as far as people are saying I think the quest 3 is a really solid product in its own right um I think he was probably not as considerate of the people who um it was built for if that makes sense um like I I know people that are very obsessive about the Vision Pro that yeah sure every every single one of them very in the Apple ecosystem um but I don't think that's the reason why genuinely I think they like it as much as they do because it's super made for them if that makes sense um I just found it so
fatiguing to use dude totally like it has major problems I got a headache just thinking about wearing it the main thing that's interesting about the Apple Vision Pro to me personally is is what that means for the next versions right like what is Apple Vision Pro 2 or 3 going to be like if if they can honestly they don't even need the screens to be that much better they need the lenses to be better they can get the facial like recognition better I I found out that everyone apparently gets 21
W um which is like the the size that it assigned to me and it's it's it's mindblowing to me that big screen this actually isn't in the review there was so much to say um we couldn't put everything in but it it's mindblowing to me that big screen a tiny company of absolute nobody's no offense you guys are great um fantastic I mean compared to apple right came in and used Apple used Apple's own depth camera to make a better version of a VR headset fitment system like come on how did Apple manage
to do it worse if strategic I wonder if it was on purpose that it's not that good no for sharing I doubt it yeah I really don't think so well then why would they make like 50 different I forget how many different versions of the face um of the face cushion they make but there's like a ton there's like a ton of different  then yeah um but yeah I think that's the one thing that he was he was less publicly considerate of at least um is that it is absolutely made for for specific people
that are going to absolutely love it um I do think um that with some of the coverage of the Apple Vision Pro that if I had never used any VR before I would just assume that it just was better um which I think is misleading especially if like oh I want this for the things that VR is currently doing really well like being able to like you know go home and I don't really want to go to the gym today but like I want to burn some calories so I'm going to stand here and flail my arms and play beats saber or
whatever else like I want to be able to do those things um yeah Vision Pro is going to be bad at that if it can do it at all like it's no it can't yeah so whatever apparently it has a beat saer clone I didn't even bother trying it Fruit Ninja Alex tried it and he's just like yeah it's like beat saber on easy and it's still glitchy yeah so just complete waste of time it's not going to do those things well but you'll see people on Planes Trains and Automobiles using these things doing productive work
more productively than they could have otherwise um you'll you'll see people using them in weird specific scenarios where they're going to get stuff done or they'll watch movies uh a lot consistent theme in the people that I know that have it of something that they've been enjoying is just watching movies and shows and stuff the screen is so good did we did Jake Bell's um AMD ultimate Tech upgrade earlier this week that's going to be another good one I don't even know what that video is but uh one
of the things we talked about was he would have gotten an apple Vision Pro if it had been out when he got his budget and I was like are you kidding me he's like no I what would even be left in the budget I love they so expensive I mean "it's a $5,000 budget so he could buy a" base model one and then still buy like an AM to put on his shelf yeah to appease AMD or whatever you can look at it with the pass through yeah look how good the pass through is watch throw the CPU at me I'll Dodge
it oh man but he was he was saying yeah I would have 100% gotten an apple Vision Pro because that's what I do I I'm I'll watch 3D movies like all the time and and I'm so it's made for him I don't even remember what life was like when I did things by myself like I've had I've had a spouse for I've had a partner for longer than I have been a I have been with Yvonne I've been with Ivonne for longer than I have not yes now like in my life including infant like like my adult life the entire thing I don't
remember what life was like doing something by myself and I have had kids for over 10 years now I had that I had a I know this is not like a new thought or anything but I had it where I I fully deeply recognized recently that there's a certain line in my memory where I remember the story not the thing like that memory is actually just gone y I know that I've recited this story and I can still recite the story but the memory is genuinely gone and I was like o that Line's creeping up so
for me I don't even remember what it's like to have 3 hours where there is nobody who needs my attention yeah and nothing that I need to do I cherish that time so deeply I've also had a company for over 10 years now yeah and so you know this this is this is I'm not this I'm not bragging it sucks like if if you get private time to sit and you know watch a film in Your  couch like I wonder how I wonder how you'll feel about that I I genuinely do when when the nest is empty or like
let's let's fast forward what would it be 10 8 years 8 years true say let's say teren had some more time to marinate taken more of the duties flushed out hiring in certain areas to kind of pull some more things off your shoulders your kids are now now significantly maybe they're still living at home yeah they probably don't want to hang out with me though y but probably not and you have time is that a bad thing would I would I does that feel bad watch I I don't know how to deal with
that yeah I I think that's going to be an extremely difficult Hill for me to get over yeah cuz lonus is a  d that was very well timed but you're like a do things person right so like and and often do things with people yeah for someone who um is as misanthropic as I  um dude I don't know I I have no idea how to deal with that so the point is that it is it's unfathomable for me to think I have some time I'm going to strap a screen to my head and watch a film movie there just just the only way
I can justify spending time in VR at all is that I exercise like I'm burning I'm burning calories uh easy peasy MH right mhm and then I never I never I never I don't really game in VR that much because I'm in VR for a purpose and if I want a game I want to relax and so maybe that's one of the reasons that I didn't enjoy Alex I just found it like I don't want to I I VR is not that for me it's not like I need to think about how to solve a puzzle and like it just felt tedious then again I I just kind of
find half-life's approach to storytelling kind of tedious careful I know I know I'm sorry yeah there goes another oh we already lost we lost them earlier anyway that's fine yeah they hate maybe like 20 cuz some of the viewers have recycled yeah oh that's  problem uh oh yeah we were trying to Rapid Fire through topics weren't we and then we just Google gas Google's partnered with the environmental defense fund on a methane leak monitoring system called methane sat that uses a satellite
to catalog and map leaks from oil and gas companies around the world while agriculture is a major source of methane the energy sector is responsible for an estimated 40% of Humanity's Global methane emissions uh the irony of companies like Google with their enormous um Power sucking data centers being the Watchdog for you know emissions and whatever is not lost on me but hey I mean maybe this will create a an arms race of the fuel companies watch doog and Google and then maybe there
will be some accountability that'd be great uh I I think it's specifically for leaks not really usage though I know yeah yeah I just I just mean if if if if companies start putting pressure on each other publicly someone had to do it uh GM shipo on full plane chat said super cool until they kill this service too so yeah this will be cool for like four five years blows up but it won't ah it's pretty good sorry um I think that's sweet though they said Google will likely roll out the map publicly by the
end of 2024 I really hope if they do if they do it publicly they use like poop   um God such a trash joke anyways um you don't even get a ding you get nothing that's fine yeah get nothing the EU has agreed to car out agreed to a car vote that excludes iMessage from the gatekeeper designation that would subject Apple to additional regulatory scrutiny and additional responsibilities under the digital markets act iMessage technically meets the definition of a gatekeeping platform with at least 45
million monthly users within the EU in a market cap of at least 75 billion EUR however iPhones have much smaller market share in the EU Compared to North americ America and most iPhone users in the EU use alternative messaging platforms like WhatsApp anyway which is classified as a gatekeeping platform in other EU news the European Court of Human Rights determined that laws requiring that messaging services retain extensive amounts of user information and embed back doors into encrypted Communications
are illegal and violate the European convention on human rights nice common EU win uh we got a couple more to get through um a Canadian Airline was found to be responsible for its chat Bots claims get own Air Canada uh it was decided by a Canadian tribunal will have to honor an $880 refund that was promised by their customer service chatbot the bot inaccurately told a customer who was traveling to his grandmother's funeral that he could apply for a bereavement discount retroactively which Air Canada
then denied because he had not followed appropriate protocol I didn't even know that was a thing me neither in court Air Canada argued man if they had just not argued this quietly paid it I would not know about bereavement discounts and just making sure and neither would any of you everyone should follow through and try to get one of these if you need to fly in for bement yeah yeah that's what happens Air Canada when you stri and affect things yeah in court Air Canada argued it could not be held
liable for information supplied by one of its Representatives thereby implying that the bot was somehow a separate legal entity capable of making its own independent decisions according to the tribunal Air Canada is responsib responsible for the accuracy of its bot's claims and we'll have to refund the complaint in other news uh wow YouTube premium has 100 million subscribers that's a lot that's kind of incredible um okay I put a note here and then I think I didn't press thing okay
there we go um yeah so that's a lot uh Google one reached a similar Milestone this month for context Spotify has over 200 million paid subscribers and Apple has over a billion paid subscribers spread out over Apple music Apple 1 and iCloud you know it's kind of weird that there isn't like a Google One Premium that comes with YouTube you know what it's really weird there's no way for me to buy YouTube premium for our Google workspace accounts yeah I remember you talking about that what the I would buy it
immediately you know how often I have to sit and watch ads at work because I don't have Google premium on my work account like it's not just something we can corporately buy and apply to everyone's accounts you don't have your personal browser well yeah but dude I'm in the analy dashboard all the time I'm always signed in is my work account I can't stand it so I'll copy the URL and open it over it's just it's it's stupid yeah it's stupid yeah all right wo after dark yeah let's
do it yeah all right you want to get the light should I I'll get it okay thank you eight right just in case just in case any of them are getting tired and want to go cuz we don't know necessarily what time zones they came in from oh yeah should we take take theirs first yeah we were trying to figure out when the bus should arrive oh um I was kind of thinking maybe about 11: 11:30 sorry what's going to arrive the bus to take them all home that makes sense I that but that is logic been trying to figure
that out with Mr Curtis yeah we should we should find out when the in-person W show viewers wow they look tired wow pathetic okay there's a little bit of energy over on the left there oh inappropriate inappropriate yeah exactly thank you I don't even know what that was maybe maybe if you were a little more enthusiastic or excited one day when you're older I'll tell you about it okay thank you okay what do you think about an hour uh I don't know it depends how many merch
messages oh my God there's uh there's a lot of potentials dude how are there so many merch messages what the heck are you doing over here let's go unfortunately today was the day where most of them were reasonable questions Oh weird cuz we didn't even have like a big product launch or anything I know bit sets yeah bit sets the top seller again bit sets existed oh the W hoodie and short circuit hoodie yeah they're on promo yeah yeah they're moving yeah I know yeah higher percentage of quality
messages all right hit me Dan all right I'll do my best hey dll I'm hoping for a 4our Wan show to listen to during my attempt at a sub 4-Hour Marathon this weekend well you're contributing to it way to go good luck on the sub 4 Hour what is your all uh what is your all greatest physical accomplishment I don't know if I have too many physical accomplishments I can do a back flip on a trampoline outside of work hours yes  Elijah I don't know um physical accomplishment I can ride a a motorized
unicycle that counts that absolutely counts that counts it's motorized it's a lot easier does it have a gyro that tries to stabilize you oh I just imagined like a giant one that had like a two-stroke on it not not the self balancing ones I assumed yeah I assumed it was self balancing one uh it's a little bit hard oh my God ads I don't care about Canada's truck event there's a video of me playing hockey where I like run some kid over and my grandpa um who's filming yells in
the background he's like oh way to go Luger and that makes me happy every time I watch it um I clothline someone while I was on my knees that was pretty funny um there was one time when my my good buddy Chad was at the bottom of a pile of people in rugby and I was mad because I was pretty sure they were giving them shots because they weren't actively getting off so I just started tossing people off the pile yelling at them to get off my friend um that was fun um there was one time where
in football we're doing this drill where you line up against each other one person has the ball the other and there's like a very narrow cone passage and yet the person with the ball has to try to get past the other person and um I was about to beat a person who was notably Rivals with me and he face masked the heck out of me cranked my neck my vision dialed in and everything and I took a little bit sitting on the side and then when I recovered just raged got back in line
and then line jumped to match him again and just mhm that seems like a Thing Luke would do yeah I um I have a black belt that's  yeah I mean you saw me fight Dennis yeah yeah you did some cool stuff tried yeah I don't know man probably probably the the best stuff I've ever done physically would be on a badminton court like I've I've I unfortunately I never film my games I really should but I've made some absolutely stupid like diving save shots and stuff like that but like
whatever uh I I have I have no I have no documentation of any of this my specialty for a while was like diving up to the very front of the net catching it really low and playing just like a barely over the net net shot I actually managed to roll it from only about probably 3 or 4 inches off the ground full extension dive popped it up and it actually just rolled over the net so pretty much an automatic point it's very difficult to return it when it rolls over the tape uh but yeah I have I have
none of that I have none of that tape that's why my Badminton Center will have cameras on all the courts and I can record all my epic moments put together my like Call of Duty freaking montages all right I have I have two more football ones one in a very important game I blocked a kick I'm a I was Defensive defensive end I blocked a kick by jumping and putting my arm in the way which ended up being quite impactful with which is really cool ni uh and then another one I don't remember the exact
specifics of this story so if somehow this person is listening and I recount it incorrectly I apologize um but my memory is um myself in the other defensive end so I'm left side defensive end he was right side defensive end we both broke past and we're getting to the quarterback and in my memory I got there slightly ahead Dove and was able to punch the ball out of his hand and he recovered the ball and scor a touchdown it was the only time our defensive line ever scored a touchdown oh really which
was sick and I was the one that scored it Devon the other guy abely but I'm very happy with my invol yeah I'm I'm very stoked with my involvement on that and that was really cool so Crystal and float plane chat like it's in Taekwondo L I have two as well these other things hence the gentle ribbing of Taekwondo which isn't really a martial art fing got him is that is that one of the ones um there's some martial arts that started very legit Taekwondo is a sport now okay yeah and I think it started it
probably started quite legit more com combat oriented yeah I'm not I'm not I don't know but I know there's some that or maybe it never was I don't know but it's yeah it's whatever they've become more like after school class and like a belt Farm than much of a martial art but yeah more more  toddlers like anything you get out of it what you put in you can certainly get a black belt in Taekwondo and be utterly useless and you can certainly get a black belt in Taekwondo and be extremely
dangerous did you get the black belt for beating up toddlers is that what I'm hearing no they don't give you black he could but he could how many do you think he could fight raining 50 toddlers black belt to the face next video you get stripes for every like 10 addition toddlers that you take on D you don't kick them in the face you kick them in the stomach so that they go flying and they hit the next ones I like com with many stripes I'm going to I'm going to sign up that sounds
fun where do you see the future of gaming consoles or exclusivity with Microsoft and Sony potentially going multiplatform it seems that opening up games to a larger audience make sense despite Hardware dead dead dead easy Nintendo will hold on as long as possible but they've already got their IPs on mobile matter of time let's go lonus on a previous W show I asked you why there isn't an emulator for Cuda this week zuda was released which basically does exactly that and has
received funding from AMD and Intel yes wait what this is super exciting I didn't heard topic I didn't hear about this I don't know but it's super cool that is super cool yeah so there was a clause uh AMD was funding the development and then there was a clause in the agreement where if AMD stopped funding it buddy could just open source it so they stopped funding it now it's open source let's go wow it's not perfect but boy is it ever a lot better than nothing which is what it we had so
yeah very cool that's epic hi w. dll any idea why the GPU industry moved away from increasing bus size I remember a 512-bit bus used to be a huge selling point but even a 256bit bus feels rare to see these days uh because bus width does not scale with uh process node shrinking like it doesn't get cheaper more transistors can get cheaper um more memory can get cheaper but that that bus width is is a function of how many how many data pins and the complexity of the design uh so unless so so there's
no so as you scale up um you know how much how much data you can move per pin as you as you create you know newer faster memory standards or you continue to move the memory closer and closer to the compute even going as far as hbm where it's like on the same package um you you can get you can get greater speeds through different means whereas bus width is more like brute forcing it it's like yeah let's just put like a gigantic memory interface with a whole bunch of pins on this thing and like a
whole bunch of memory packages um so as as GPU makers are are trying to cost down their designs um I I don't think we're ever going to see a return to I don't I don't think we're ever going to see another 512-bit bus I mean what what a flop that thing was I'm trying to remember the 2900 XT Radeon 2900 uh 512 bit bus or no no it was the no it was the R6 r600 was the code name uh what was the r600 amdr 600 sometimes I'm better with code names than I am with um with the actual branding names
because they mean more to me r600 this one this thing had a 512 bit bus and was a piece of  ah okay what was it oh 2900 did I say 2900 before I don't know whatever this was the the 2900 series um and where's the bus width I'm pretty sure it's 512 yeah yeah yeah yeah we know how many mes oh is it not oh no this one had the ring bus it was like uh hold on hold on hold on hold on okay what's the 512 bit boss chip that I'm thinking of then hold on okay now now I've got now I'm curious 5 12
bit I don't think nvidia's ever done one  they nvidia's next Flagship rumored to have 512 bit Buzz help me out guys yeah 384 on the  bit card man all the news is just recent  Blackwell hold on hold on radon some gpus such as amds radon 2900 XT the Nvidia gtx280 oh no this is just  512-bit Vector registers okay apparently yeah apparently there weren't any not that I can see no GTX 200 series didn't you're probably looking at the Dual GPU one that had two 256bit bus gpus on it
and some manufacturers advertised by combining that number but that is not how that works um did the 290x R9 290x 512 bit let's see oh yeah yeah yeah it was it was the 290x okay yep that thing was also kind of a piece of so there you go it's it increases complexity it increases cost it has questionable Merit in terms of improving performance at least for Consumer applications when you're better off just using faster memory connected to a narrower bus and uh I think the the
GPU makers have shown time and time again that they just do not prefer that approach with that said if we get a Blackwell GPU with a 512-bit bus it'll probably be ripping fast but that'll be because it was made for you know compute and Ai and stuff not because that was necessarily what they needed for gaming lldd colon as a teacher I am curious of what your thoughts on the removal of letter grades in public education any challenges you would be willing to talk about with your kids and
school um what is in place so right now it's been the the traditional AB c d f you whatever whatever you know s for the top Triple S yeah exactly um has been replaced by um developing something proficient extending and you know it's one of those things where um you know the justification for it I was reading this article about it a while back and they're like oh well you know this new system is designed to you know keep the parents in tune with what's going on to communicate what's going on with their
kids and and it's like to and how well they're doing it's like right yeah that's what letter grades did they communicated how well the kid was doing I me even when I was a kid they didn't have F they just had ABC n and n was needs Improvement and then you also got like like an effort score almost it was G for good s for satisfactory and I for I for something else um okay well I didn't I mean maybe if you tried hard enough maybe you didn't just need Improvement maybe you actually failed but like they weren't
holding any kids back in grades when I was in school they did at my school oh well there you go um so they've apparently me but we've apparently been marching in this direction for quite some time um the really silly thing about it to me is that a we already had a system for this it was called a b c d Etc and now we have a new system for this and it's e p something and guess what the report cards say they just have the letter on it because that's what the letters are for is a quick way of
communicating how the kid is doing in the class so you've just replaced a with E and you've replaced B with p and you've replace C with whatever the other one is like it's just why who cares is it's not it's not like kids are going to feel any less bad for getting uh you know I can't what even is the bad one I can't even remember what they are um so vague extending I thought there was also a percentage like I specifically remember that an a was 83% like that is 86 yeah that is burned into my brain so
they don't have that they switch over to letter grades in high school still but I think they're like extending this so it's um emerging devel V oping proficient and extending so you can't even just be like e you have to write the whole word so that's what's the bad one emerging emerging I can't we just have number I I don't know Dan I thought it was both like you got an A but like how can I compete with my fellow classmates so who got the better more good or or a but dude this is like this
is just it's it's it's just the constant it's the constant evolution of language right like it's it's kind of like how we have a word that means that you have a developmental difficulty that word turns into an insult it turns into a slur it becomes a bad word so we create a new term that is that is not a slur but means the same thing then people latch on to that they start using it as a slur and then you create a new one it's like okay well this is extending is the new a
and emerging is the new F and then when people don't like being called emerging anymore because yeah I don't know I wouldn't either then you emerging like a turtle then we switch to numbers little baby turtle and then we switch again it's like so it's Luke just creating new insults here oh man we're going to have to change it again do it why does this always happen like I called someone deficient a little while ago that's biting and I'm just like well because I was looking for I
was not to their FA not no not to them oh you're insulting them behind their back I was describing I was describing uh someone and I was looking for a word that I could use that meant what I mean and was I was allowed to use and I was like I was trying to think of something un like deficient that's so brutal that is actually painful I'm I'm stealing that one but that word is not but that word's not canceled so I can use it until someone clues in and then I'll have to come up with a new word good day 
deficient oh it hurts that's actually painful yeah uh let's let's move on people like that's kind of insulting of course it's insulting insults are just insults are meant to be insulted oh man I remember I remember someone telling me about a person they knew who was um they characterized them as a particular type of person because they used a particular type of word to hurt a particular type of other person I'm not going to get more specific than that and they were like they're that
type of person I'm like no what they are is aing that's what they are what they did was use whatever the meanest word they possibly could was it had nothing to do with anything it wasn't charged behind what that word means everything to do with how much it would hurt the other person and nothing to do with anything else and I almost feel like like binning these people into like oh you're a racist or oh you are you know uh sexist or oh you're this or oh you're that it's almost doing them a
favor because it it lets them be like oh yeah I'm a totally normal perfectly cool person other than you know I'm a little bit this it's like no you're a that's what you are sorry not sorry I think that's and there goes actually I don't think that's that much of our audience I'm going to give you guys the benefit of the doubt here the vast majority of people do use those words not saying that that makes it okay oh there's people who are racist that too there's people who are ableists
there's people who are those who are sexist 100% totally but in this particular case I knew the target I knew the origin of the insult and I was like no that person's just a jerk they just wanted to hurt that Target as much as possible and they knew that that was the worst word they could say that was the only reason they would have said a completely different word if that other word would have hurt more just like that yeah yeah it's a weird one and I'm I'm finding that this is
something that everyone talks about too you you like you you learn language faster when you're a kid it's like yeah the inverse is you learn language slower when you're not a kid yeah every day I get slower Dumber weaker man I hate it it sucks sucks yeah but that means that you're going to eventually kind of slide behind the times with what's cool and what's not cool to say and that's funny when it's cringe and that's not funny when it's like a word that is no longer cool yeah man I I was uh I I became I I
had someone point out something to me the other day I can't remember what it was now but I'd probably remember if I was going to say it um and they were like you know yo that has like a super negative connotation I was like oh okay well all right I'll file remember that one file that away a lot of them I don't even know what the unfortunately I'm just deficient I can't keep up with it lonus you're losing your RZ and your eyebrows are no longer on fleek okay the Fleek one is old yeah I
wanted to combine okay okay cool cool cool cool cool there is that better yeah bushed them they look pretty you look absolutely poggles or whatever the the kids are saying these days they're they're my bush babies those are some skibidi Skid SK I don't know those are some eyebrows man I used to like that song uh skibby it's little big I think is the original song I don't remember behind skibbidy yeah it's a real song that I mean it's malformed for I think that I think that's been moved on
from that's kind of old news now anyway in summary I think that the new grading  emerging see my issue with that is that it implies trajectory upwards okay what if there isn't well what if they're getting worse so what if they're not improving what if they're not learning fine fine it's deficient yes it's deficient I'm sorry it's uh it implies things that are not necessarily happening we already had what it's trying to achieve the only difference is that now we have a
confusing new way of doing it like I you know what I think I've said this before I should bring some of my old report cards from when I was a kid in you can tell 100% what kind of kid I was because they filled out all my letter grades and all my different subjects and they wrote a blurb about me yeah that's what a report card is we already had this we just had to actually do the work all right's you think like hypercritical parents aren't going to see emerging and get really Agro on their kids like if I
had to guess I'd say I'd say avoiding confrontations with parents would be a big part of any of this the confusion is a feature not a bug that might be it hey dll Will the screwdriver shaft extension be available with nerdling no cuz the shafts of our screwdrivers that you put them into will always have nerling because even the stubby has nerling right yes yeah amazing do you think AR glasses with transparent OLED displays will be the direction we go in the future once the
Optics are figured out do you think our smartphones will largely be replaced by glasses I do it's hard to say man because I would have said pass through wouldn't get as good as the Apple Vision Pro even like two or three years ago and here we are um I think it can get better too like I I thought Inside Out tracking was was never going to be as good as outside in and there are aspects of it that are still trash um but it's better than I thought it could ever be and so you know looking at what they've been
able to do with computational Photography in Mobile phones over the last 10 years is also something I just never thought would be possible with sensors that small with lenses that crap you know it's very very hard to say I mean I do think that that mixed reality eyewear of some sort you know if it's in Star Trek someone will invented at some point it's coming but I don't know exactly what form it's going to take and you know everyone's going to be in a mad rush to develop better cameras
for path pass through type or develop better displays for um for uh a mixed reality type and we're going to see who wins I guess and I'll I'll be there for it I'm I'm ready excited hey dlll with AI functionality starting to be offloaded to CPUs and other Hardware how much longer do you think it'll be before most AI fun will be offline or local to your computer oh there's going to be a massive uh reason for companies to not let that happen um because the amount of data collection that can happen from
what you're trying to use these for is is huge um that being said there is steps in that direction already like the Apple stuff they're trying to make it so you can do it on your phone locally um does that mean they won't be collecting that data heck no yeah so is there really a difference I don't know um fully genuinely disconnected from anything externally stuff um I think we're very lucky that stuff like llama exists uh and I think it's going to be like that for a while so yeah hi W.D living in a
6x2 foot walk-in closet and I have a non-vision pro budget for VR goggles I use for personal theater only lus what suggest questions can you think of for someone like me not into games I mean I would if okay well it depends um the best non-vision pro display that I've experienced is the big screen Beyond however the internal Reflections are much more noticeable than the Vision Pro the mo the best bang for the buck is the  the Beyond's still really expensive though man you got to buy the
lighthouses you got to buy the controllers it's only a headset for "$1,000 or whatever it" is um man I I hate to give you this answer but if if what you're after is content man there's going to be some leaps in like micro OLED display technology over the next little bit I saw some demos of what's coming um it's actually in one of our CES videos the one with the like clickbait apple please use this in your products title or whatever it is um it's freaking amazing how bright some
of these upcoming displays are going to be and how dense they're going to be they're going to make the Vision Pro look like pretty good um but it's going to be quite a while before they're cost effective enough that you're going to be buying them in A500 600 $700 headset so so if that's what you're after more than anything else either I I I I wouldn't make a big investment I guess is what I'm trying to say like I would grab at most a quest three and then I would I would keep
saving my pennies just like keep keep saving keep saving keep saving rather than buying a Cadillac today if that makes sense yeah display technology dud it's moving so fast very exciting I got a couple for Luke here a few weeks ago Luke talked about doing sec stuff for small businesses how would you go about approaching them just stopping in and going hi I'm Luke can I secure your business thanks uh actually kind of um cold calling yeah it's the hardest thing you will ever do and then you get used
to it yeah especially when you just walk in the door which was more more close to my strategy I call as much I just walk I never did commercial I only did residential so I always knocked on a door painting cold calling man it's like you're going to see some stuff yeah especially residential yeah U I didn't do much residential I did a little bit but not there's this one house we painted where the guy like obviously had a sugar baby living with them maybe a 25 year difference it's a lot
yep okay um what was the exact question sorry my brain is struggling uh you talked about doing security stuff how would you go about approaching them oh uh this is not a advice um you can show holes that exist depends on um what your stomach is for them getting really mad at you yeah that's that's not advice that's some spicy advice you could also get in trouble legally so like yeah this is genuinely not advice but that is a thing that people do this is documented you can look it up online um there are
people that have gotten very highly legitimate jobs by doing that but there is also people that have ended their butt in jail for a significant period of time for doing that so uh at your own risk um what you can more legitimately do though is like prep a document of some sort um on the types of risks that that type of business could um be open to um and the the types of Damages that could happen maybe even includes some forms of case studies of like hey look there's a a business of a
similar size to yours um in you know a similar area maybe the same country Tre something like that um that had this type of thing happened and this is how their business was effectively deleted afterwards you can look all this information up you don't have to trust me let me come in and try to improve your resilience against this type of thing um and if if company owners have never you know um been approached by someone willing to do this before uh it it might work so that that was that the
second example was more of what I would  okay another one here for you Luke High DL question for Luke I work in safety critical software and have been considering moving jobs how common is it to have complete software requirements uh SL tests in conventional software he's laughing uh yeah not very um I I if you're if you're outside of like extremely safety important software uh if someone talks about how their system has complete tests uh a lot of those tests are probably very bad
um I I I would in in my experience talking to other people and even seeing some of it myself um if you try to get that level of coverage some of that testing is just going to be junk and some of your developers uh might even write the test so that they're definitely just going to pass all the time so they don't have to worry about it um so I don't know most people that I know of in the industry right now are not advising for complete test coverage um you test you write tests for like very Mission critical
things uh fairly sparingly so that you're not just wasting your time um now are we people that are making things that land people on the moon no um so yeah but yeah less my TV broke and I bought a LGC 3 based off your support of OLED Tech buron still scares me do you think the fact that you can replace Tech anytime affects your view on products I think it can but I also hate waste and I hate when things break so that's something I don't think I'm ever going to get over um what happens more often
than not when something breaks for me is I just live with it being kind of broken and it makes me even more enraged so it's not enough time to to do all the fakes yeah I um and and it's something I it's something that I actively go out of my way to not let me like not allow to change me too much like I'm still using my cherro battery bank so do I nice yeah I was thinking about this literally the other day like you've even replaced the batteries iell mine I haven't done that oh mine just still
works and can charge my phone multiple times still it's a good battery I don't know how um they don't exist anymore do they yeah I try to I try to take like kind of a waste notot want notot approach um however there are times particularly at work that that kind of Falls away because I I I will take on less of a personal perspective to to cost and replacement cycle like expected replacement cycle and I will take on more of a of a a commercial perspective like if someone were to tell
me like oh yeah this monitor is great um but there's a risk in a few years that it will that it will burn in then I'd be like okay then buy one for our new editor like what I'm still going to be using this monitor in 3 years like no we'll we'll probably flip that or something and we'll get whatever the new hotness is because we've got to be on the current at least maybe not cutting edge but we've got to be on the current edge of Tech and display technolog is moving really fast right
now so realistically sure whatever it's a little burnt in but it'll be a secondary monitor for someone on the business team or something by that point so who cares so you'll see that you'll see that creep in sometimes um but personally no I I don't like to just replace things it it bothers me a lot um I do I do think that in the early days of OLED I you know I we actually came up with an idea for a piece of content that I don't know if I would be able to talk about for long enough but
it was 10 things or like no sorry it was five things that I recommend but wouldn't buy and five things that I would buy but don't recommend but don't recommend interesting and so in the early days of me using oleds I would buy one by the time I didn't necessarily because LG was working really closely with us at the time and they kept sponsoring videos with their Olas and I was like okay well I guess I don't have to buy one um but I would have they were they're incredible um in
fact nope no I didn't buy that one but I I had to buy a TV a little while ago I thought I thought it was an LG uh like but I whatever I I negotiated a trade so I didn't technically buy it but I have one of the signatures upstairs because it's like really good for 3D anyway the point is I would have bought one but every time I talked about them I'd be like okay right but caveat caveat caveat um and we came up with a bunch of stuff like that like there's all kinds of things that I would buy but absolutely
wouldn't recommend and there's all kinds of things that I would recommend but it's not necessarily the thing that I would buy as for the G3 I haven't seen anything to indicate that if you don't abuse it that buron would be a particular problem with it um however QD OLED is the one that I am mostly I'm more bullish on these days with that said you're going to see a really cool video sometime in the next couple of weeks where Brandon Dickerson and plof and I got to experience a um tens of thousands of dollars
mastering display alongside I believe it was a G2 and an s95 B or C I can't remember it was last Jen's cutie OLED and last Jen's OLED uh um like the 2022 models I guess hold on which one was I it doesn't matter the point is two very good TVs one cuti OLED one W OLED and this uh current gen like very very new QD OLED mastering display and as it turns out there's a lot more to it than paneltech there's a lot more to it than Peak brightness that thing is freaking cool and um even though on
paper QD OLED is is so much so much so much better whatever than w OLED for color saturation and this and that processing matters a lot and the W OED actually looked a lot better under certain conditions so um stay tuned for that it's a really going to be a really good video I went down a really current mastering monitors shank uh do use dual layer LCD and other ones do use QD OLED um so it's it's a mixture right now I went down a really weird Rabbit Hole after you mentioned churo because I was
like do they still exist so I Googled them and I found their website that is straight out of you know this is the battery bank that I still use that is super ancient um I mean they're still talking they uh still have this like Ingress partnership oh wow okay so basically they've done nothing in the last like nine years the most recent things from six years ago so they're gone you'd think right oh wait and then I clicked on this and I was like oh you can still buy it so I clicked that and it brought me to
this random phone case and I was like okay so they're gone but for some reason I was like I want to keep clicking around and I clicked on some other things I'm going to skip some steps cuz who cares and eventually I got to their Shopify page and they still exist and they still sell battery Banks they just look totally different huh okay they need to get rid of that website because that's the first result that comes up it's Cafe colored yeah it's a little weird okay all right it's probably like
the least good-looking battery Bank I've seen churro used to be a sponsor yeah I liked their stuff anyways oh yeah okay shank didn't mean all of them um so dual air LCD is super cool I I made a video about it at CES like 5 years ago or something like that in the high sense Booth uh they have since changed the name of the meaning of their branding which is really frustrating when companies do that like when Nvidia was like Shield what's Shield uh uh uh uh hey meet Shield like Shield used to be the little
portable game controller Android handheld and you like that name too much now Shield is the one that plugs into your TV yeah well guys you can't just call two things Shield who do you think you are Apple um any who so high sense was calling it UL Le which has now completely changed meanings and now just means a high-end TV that high sense makes but at the time uled meant dual air LCD for consumers and that is really cool Tech because they had a 4K front color LCD so that
was your main picture one and then it had a 1080p layer behind it that was monochromatic and then a um a full array local dimming backlight so what they were doing was they would adjust the dimming of the of the backlight Zone then they would use the monochromatic LCD to apply extra dimming anywhere where the scene is supposed to be dark and then allow all the light through wherever the scene is supposed to be bright and then the color one on top to give you the final image it was freaking
cool it was OLED like blacks really OLED like blacks but really hard to get the tech right and to bring the costs down lus and Luke I just got scoop U certified and have heard you talk about it in the past what are your favorite dive spots I don't I mean I've only really dived a couple places I don't dive here cuz diving in BC sucks also no to people who love diving in BC it's cool but it's really good for certain reasons that have nothing to do with me yeah me too I'm all about crystal clear
water and bright colored fish and you're not going to find a whole lot of either of those things around here we have you'll find very well preserved like boats and stuff cool because paint doesn't erode as fast in cold water neat also are there any more women's cut shirts coming uh I have no idea what's going on with the women's road map um Taran and Nick have been working on it ivonne's been working on it um believe it or not I'm not usually the fit model for development of the women's uh Styles
so I what am not sure right now sorry that's weird hi lul Luda Luda sure lonus since you love hand held gaming would you ever consider using a controller like gamer G8 with your phone I would never touch it game streaming and Android have come a long way game streaming and emulation on Android have come a long way was the rest of that and don't worry Dan you J great um I was I sorry I I threw off Dan yes uh 100% not only that but the performance of the latest Android handsets pretty freaking incredible
we're going to have have to change our like our gaming benchmarks now because on pretty much any Snapdragon 8 gen 3 phone which you can get for hold on is this some barode I don't know if this product is out okay it doesn't matter the point is no no it's fine it's fine I haven't given away anything anyway the point is pretty much any Snapdragon 8 gen 3 device is going to be able to run like Dolphin Emulator at 60 FPS so we need we need new benchmarks and if you can play if you can run
dolphin emulator you can you can play a lot of emulated games oh yeah um not to mention that with the latest advancements in Wi-Fi like game streaming is getting more and more reliable I'm going to be really interested to see what nvidia's next nank looks like because if we get the ability to stream or to encode at much higher bit rates we are going to have the ability with WiFi 7 to stream and decode at much higher bit rates given a generation or two too so absolutely I mean we even mentioned in
our review of the PS portal that just using a phone and a backbone or a gamster G8 or whatever some kind of clip-on controller is a totally viable option if you don't need a 7in screen yeah yeah no super cool stuff uh little shout out about the diving thing I went to amphibious Diving Center in Greece and we went on a wreck dive um that was absolutely amazing so if you happen to be there that was like a lifetime experience thing he like has a boat that can actually get you all the way out there
and not all the diving Centers do all this type of stuff so it's actually somewhat of a specific recommendation anyways keep going buying this for my upcoming interview as a park ranger nice my mom was against the career at first but has come around L us have your kids any interest in careers that would worry you what would you do my kids if anything my biggest concern is that they don't seem to think about it at all yeah like when I was my kid's age I you know I wanted to be a
firefighter I wanted to be a policeman or I wanted to be this or I wanted to be that like I I like I had stuff I wanted to do I wanted to be a teacher like I do you think that's influenced by anything I um I think it's influenced by just you know kids books you know oh the friendly police officer oh I want to be a police officer like oh the firefighter save the people no I think it still is I just think my kids just don't really think about it oh no I meant do you think your
kids not thinking about it is influenced by anything like do you think that's do they even get news about like llms and  um that took me way too long sorry I don't I don't know because we we'll talk to them about it from time to time and they just uh because it's not like they're not interested in things no they are they're very interested in things people they're not thinking about their careers at all and I mean we don't really push it um and I mean we talked to them about that
you're going to need to work hard and you're going to need a career where um you're going to it's going to have to be something that's not easy it's sort of what we talk to them about a lot what grade I don't know if you want to even say this but what grade is little man in uh I don't get super super specific about his age got it okay um whether or not he is in this category or not yet but he's pre-teen there we'll say that somewhere in there um I think they need to have at least an
inkling by the time they're in high school because when when you're in high   school I mean I don't know no YouTube didn't exist there's a hint yeah I didn't take drama class they're going to have to make decisions I didn't like I didn't make any decisions I think a lot of people will I think basing it off of your career trajectory is genuinely a mistake well no I don't mean no no I don't mean that I mean what I did in high school was I didn't take electives I took everything
and that's what made me the generalist that I am today I don't think you can actually do that though there's too many options I got a job here doing that I'm like I did the same thing lonus did you have your grade 12 in every science yeah I things and bio I took math 12 I took English 12 AP I do have that many blocks I took French 12 we had eight blocks I did stats cuz I couldn't do calculus we didn't have calculus I'd have taken Calculus if I could have I should have worked through calculus
been AP yeah AP classes I only we only had one AP offering just English oh but our AP was instead of like you wouldn't take English 12 and English 12 AP so like yeah but like in math uh there's sometimes multiple AP options okay we didn't have any we only had math 12 okay uh and then I think we were supposed to have caly signed up for it uh and so did one of my friends and we were both pretty upset that not enough people signed up for us to for them to run the class Legend legendary
dust says I don't think you're right I'm 41 he's talking to me um I'm sorry I'm fading a little bit I might read some things incorrectly I'm 41 and about to start a new career path I'm not sure anyone ever solidifies what they want to do that's not even remotely my point so sorry if that's what I communicated um you have to start somewhere um and if you if one of them wanted to go into something um oh here here's yeah there's an example just computers at my school had like a billion different
options interesting uh I think like computers at my school had computers and then the grade so computers 8 9 10 11 12 right but then it had like 3D game programming and like 3D modeling and like all these other like there was there was other yeah branching options I don't know if whatever school they end up being in will have those those things but it's like there's at least the school that I went to which was still a pretty in the middle of nowhere school there was too many options to be able to
do everything how much you want to bet I was more in the middle of nowhere than you yeah not by a huge amount but yes yeah I'll take you to my old school one day oh okay yeah was it more than your house was let me put it this way my bus ride in the morning was like 20 minutes yeah I mean mine was pretty similar all right okay all right okay and we went directly into the middle of nowhere than than where we were um I'm I'm still you're still probably right almost certainly but yeah um but no yeah
my point is like there's a lot of options and being able to aim at something I think is genuinely helpful especially at that point in life um cuz like what the heck am I going to do after high school what am I going to take in University there's too many options for you I mean I didn't take everything to be clear like I stayed academic going to go to university so I that might be the wrong move that I had decided yeah so I went hardcore academic I mean we had like mechanics 12 I didn't take it yeah um
well there's there's an example sure I mean okay so sure yeah I didn't take I so I didn't take everything when I say everything I meant everything I was including like shop and Mech in a purely academic sense I didn't take I didn't take drama 12ed maybe that's not what they want to go into sure so I mean yeah you have to you have to make some decision but I also don't think that your path is really that set at 18 uhoh so Ned's life said I am a 100% self-taught senior it manager and didn't
do postsecondary you do not need to know what you that was not the point this is not even sort of my point I'm sure you knew that you were into computers and I think that's where Luke is kind of going with this is you should probably decide look there's Olympic figure skaters who are 15 16 if you want to excel it's not a terrible idea to have some idea what you're working towards because the years where your brain is most malleable if you're watching this show right now are probably behind you
especially this time of night um well I mean and there's there's things in Australia morning decision paralysis is like a huge problem um and what I'm trying to get at is that they should start thinking about it not that they should know which is maybe in saying this I'm sick and my brain is really laggy and I'm now also tired I'm going to crush him so hard at Super check tonight yeah it's going to be rough it's going to be awesome um I might not be communicating this super well so it's
not really your guys's fault but um yeah they don't need to know what they necessarily want to do but they should maybe have an idea of some things that they're interested in that's going to help with motivation our our biggest encouragement right now is just to stay rounded we want them to do some music we want them to do something physical we want them to learn to compete um I mean honestly that's that's pretty important learning to work hard and learning to compete mean that you will try and you will be
motivated to win yeah and at the end of the day um cuz like and to to go with what the people are trying to tell me in full plane chat which I I know um most people career change drastically multiple times throughout their life so you're not going to like pick your one thing you're going to do forever when you're in high school most likely for almost everybody watching but having an idea having a good starting point having motivation because you're actually interested in like maybe I'm going to do
this for a really significant amount of time professionally maybe I should be good at it I don't think I even had any concept of that when I was like 16 though I did well all right and it was really helpful it was very motivating those were all the classes I did the best in because I actually cared we both landed right here yeah but that's not your point I know that's I actually do the things that I was working on in high school though yeah like legitimately I don't I didn't know that you uh you
worked on meetings when you were in high school you know what you know what INF fairness to high school that makes me want to die I know your buttons now I actually do a lot of what I did in high school my job more than anything is to know a little bit about everything and to write about it really well and that's exactly what I did in high school yeah know just enough to be dangerous and convey it really well and you knew that you were super interested in writing and English
and stuff like that um no I thought you did no I knew I was good at it oh okay well fair enough I figured out I was I was actually also a useful thing to use I was just kind of an anal retentive like definitely knew that kind of person like the grammar mattered you know why who cares it doesn't doesn't matter but it does uh all right Dan hit us Yeah we actually have another guest merch message today there we are hello hello uh so my question is it's been 16 years since you
launched the Linus Tech tips Channel that's not a question do you expect that lmg will still be around in some form or another in another 16 boy what does a 2040 Linus Media Group look like okay we make I would like that if I had to go 16 years into the future first of all I would have far less to do with the day-to-day operation I don't think I have the energy to do what I do and what I've done for the last 16 years for another 16 years I mean I'll be you won't have to there'll be the AI Linus
chatbot product recommender good gravy I'll be in my 50s right like that's that's BR it's a It's a Grind um I'm not complaining I have the best job in the world but it can it's still a job I so I I wouldn't I wouldn't be as involved in in the day today for sure I would still love to play around with whatever's cool and new which who even knows what it's going to be by that point I would like to think that by then we would be very vertically integrated in terms of product procurement product testing um
content creation and by that point I mean who knows looking at the the in ification of basically every ret Outlet on the face of the earth I mean maybe there's rooms there's room for like LTT laabs store.com or LTT labs. store or something like that where everything is everything is Labs verified these are actually real solid products instead of just like fake weird Amazon or Alibaba or whatever else L imagine a store you could walk into and know that everything is good Costco and yeah and look how
good that model is why don't more people follow I mean seriously everything from like our employee handbook to I genuinely trust products from C to our to our sort of philosophy for for for well-being it's just like lifted straight from Costco because they have a great model and and like you were kind of saying earlier like it might not be it's it's probably a pretty good value but it might not be the absolute best value it might not be whatever but you know it's going to be like pretty good
yep it's probably pretty good yeah I uh I had a I had a conversation with my mom where uh she wanted honey in her tea and I was like okay I don't drink tea so I you know my honey is just in like a giant thing cuz we'll use it for like cooking like it's not for we don't put it in drinks um so so I grabbed it and she kind of gave me that disapproving look of anything that is like in a giant container because it's not I don't know Artisan or something and the point is it doesn't matter uh and she made an
off-hand comment about how it's probably fake and did you know that there's more honey on shelves than there are bees in the world and that kind of thing I was like I don't know dude it's Kirkland it's Kirkland it's probably fine she's like no probably not I'm like no I mean it's Kirkland it's probably fine and she's like no it's probably not I'll use it anyway I'm like whoa hold on a second you do not talk smack about Kirkland Signature yeah in this house so I so I Google it I'm like how to tell if honey
is real and it turns out it's actually really simple all you do is take a Q tip um sorry a cotton swab um take is that a thing sorry Q-tips a brand so I don't I don't know maybe do they have Q-Tips in Australia I don't know so you take a cotton swab like the little ear picker that you don't put in your ears um you dip it in the honey okay before not after you stick it in your ear sorry this is getting very derailed um I got a stall for longer so he'll get more tired so I'll crush him even harder
at Super Shacks then you take a match or lighter and you hold it up to it and if it if it bubbles um or caramelizes um or or ignites then it's real honey and if it isn't then it's some you know nonsense garbage like I was going to say ant jamaa surup but a that's a maple syrup substitute and B I don't think they use that branding anymore because it was terrible um was it oh yeah oh I mean the I the undertones they were over oh okay yeah I genu I have it's the whole thing um the point is that it's real long
story short Kirkland signature honey is real that's actually heck yeah of course it is heck yeah dude it's like dude I would have assumed that either it would be real or it was like solid I don't know how else well honey has to be honey it's said 100% honey on the thing so it had to be honey then sure yeah I didn't know it did that so yeah I trust Costco and I want to be like Costco yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's like that's the thing with a appliances like if Costco had a Blog on
their like product research and development oh dude would you read it every day right every post so there 16 years from now will be Electronics Costco with complete vertical integration start to finish guiding you to exactly the right product some little chatbot that floats in Your Vision 10 pack of motherboards that is lus but like stuck when he's like I don't know 34 or something the return policy I get it now uh yeah even Costco dialed back the return policy for electronics it's
not sustainable incredible applian is the big one for me appliances I want I want to there's they're so smok in mirrors like I have no idea how to interpret half of that stuff it's just obnoxious and there's there's this whole thing where like uh you know how this this will happen with like graphics cards they'll have one graphics card compared to a different graphics card there'll be different memory chips on it you know like this was a big thing when GPU mining was first taken off was like uh
oh you want the what was it the Samsung memory ones everyone wanted those like they'll have different components in the same model of of like refrigerator or whatever and there's no way for you to really know so like does it have a Dan fos compressor I don't know yeah so maybe some person's review is super positive and then then like I don't know yeah and to close this out ch56 9 says uh this is from float plane chat if it isn't supposed to go in my  atheists fair enough do you regret signing up for that
shirt thing now not at all not at all thanks for coming out well um I guess let's continue on there's a jacket Dan I I don't even know how do you how do you turn a question into like a 20min try  honey would you like me to show you because I can do it again we do it again this is like a master class in in I don't even know I don't even know what skill this is can you even call it a skill damn skill it's another thing I practiced in high school not paying attention to what I'm supposed to be
doing and talking a lot absolutely phenomenal filibustering filibustering yeah he's filibustering his own time uh all right well whatever Hi D question for lonus is there story behind the Cleveland Browns lava lamp in your office I grew up with you I grew up in Cleveland with that factory of disappointment uh and I'm curious if you are a fan man can you imagine can you imagine choosing a color for your team and going with the Browns it's like okay there's the Reds there's the All Blacks
there's the like it's not like naming your team a color is not totally a thing but Brown it's like yeah we were like what what color says performance less than brown KN to yeah but they did that being ironic did they yeah they were like we picked the worst possible thing we picked the ugliest thing so it would be iconic uh H I looked up once Brown was a guy's last name   bad sports team tech oh it's from that yeah yeah well what I'm going to throw away a perfectly good lava lamp no so there you
go that's why that's the that's the real story all right I am planning on making a review of the LTT bag in relation to other bags especially for professional use how do you best structure a video to be critical yet not come off as overtly critical overly critical one of the keys is trying to see the product from the perspective of other people and then framing your review that way and I mean this in general it's just kind of a best practice you should always talk about
your personal opinions and your personal experiences but absolutely nothing in this world exists without and okay some things do but products no product exists without some human at some point having had a hand in it in some way and it can be often enlightening to try to imagine or better yet even ask the people who designed it why did you do it that way because sometimes there's a reason that you might not have imagined uh for example we are working on a revised um screw top
uh spout top uh lid for our water bottle so we're doing our own mold we're making our own and one of the things that's kind of irritating about it in my in my early use of it is that we have the threads for the cap on the outside so you can like you can feel them on your lips when you're drinking from it the reason we did that is to make it more cleanable it's a super cleanable lid we have little tabs on both of the O-rings so that they're really easy to remove clean Andor replace and the reason that
we have the threads on the outside is it keeps any of the liquid inside from getting caught in those grooves and getting gunked up it's super easy to clean with a brush and then close it up leaving no um rided surfaces on the inside where the drink contacts so imagining different perspectives and imagining different use cases is one of the things that I think sets a strong reviewer apart from someone who just publishes you know rants that other people don't find relatable your
perspective matters your honesty matters but try to broaden your perspective as well and the more that you can do that I think the more appeal  have I love combin techology and what a of your I curated this I sorry I was muted I'm sorry about I think oh really yeah uh hi this is Jack I love combining technology and Theatrical Productions what would a musical of your life consist of and what fun Tech would you use I don't know but they would be just like the catchiest show tunes man I love
show tunes oh really um oh I know man 100% oh okay yeah don't make me start singing them cuz like one day copyright whatever you get the whole you don't have a SN license you'll get the whole show struck down dude uh anyway I love show tunes um there would oh man I'm trying to think like um I think yours would just be nuts I like dialogue I I like dialogue in my songs like like people like like talking and like I loved Hamilton Hamilton was super cool um I don't know yeah love it yeah lame
is let's go hey lldd Andrew LD Weber for Life sorry sorry sorry another controversial what's the um the like is it and they can they can just off I don't know if I can say this on stream what's the train one he has a train the train one I have no idea what you're talking about Android L Weber has a train one oh I don't know I haven't seen all of his plays actually hey lldd just charged my Game Boy Advance SP for the first time in over a decade and the battery still holds a charge like new why is this
lithium ion battery uh marked 2002 so much better than new batteries it's not  him there's no explanation it's not it's it's not better it's worse um and it was probably sitting at like kind of an ideal charge State hopefully um for a long time and you got lucky and like yeah it's like anything some of them are better than others and sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't um but no a battery chemistry has definitely improved in the last 20 years 100% hi lld my partner and I watch every
Friday love you babe just had my first week at a new tech startup job do you have any memorable stories from onboarding new members at lmg um I had one who for the job that they were hired actually we had a couple in the early days who um expressed um a desire to quit if they continued having to do the job that they were hired for and when we had had fewer than 10 people on the team there was more than one person that I had to basically create a new position for and then rehire for that position or fill it
myself so that's that was something that's funny I guess nice uh dear when Dash Cur when Cur uh with products like naous screwdriving okay I'm sick and tired and still got that good good come on come on Dan uh no I was trying to be koi about it oh okay got it with products I'm not whatever you guys suck uh it means wakers Luke huh you have aing button for that dear with products like the nocuous screwdriver that wasn't a no who usually pays who are they licensed for free mutually beneficial
also please bring back the RGB sweater it's it's been gone for ages um there are no products like the KN to a screwdriver other than the KN to a screwdriver I don't think we have any other like collaborative products and no money changed hands for that we just thought it was really cool the community thought it was cool no thought it was cool so we did it yeah what do you think contributes to the strong emotional response AI causes in some people is it distrust fear about
job security contrarianism or something else entirely contrarianism I don't think it's contrarianism but it's definitely distrust and fear and that's very real logic got him reason I it's extremely reasonable and like normal to um be very concerned when you see things like Sora totally reasonable if if you look at that and go I see Zero potential problem at all like I want to be friends with that person they seem like an optimist that you could exploit very easily yeah
unfortunately I asked what what oh he's so mean to me I asked this a while ago now but have you changed your mind about buying EVGA yet I mean I don't think I was ever planning to buy EVGA I don't believe it's for sale I may have misunderstood the question yeah what I mean I we bought EVGA gpus for our land PCS no regrets they're working great yeah awesome I'm not sure uh hi yes I am customizing my bits for Retro Game repairs I know lonus likes ff6 in Chrono Trigger what is
Luke's favorite retro game that isn't morrowwind Oblivion oh that isn't bethesa it's Halo that's I was going to give my like joke answer and then correct it to Halo they ask so few questions of you directly Luke and I still come in and steal them what aing dick oh man that's pretty good and that's it for the W show we should we should just have cardboard cut out Luke and I'll just I'll just be him you you don't even need a straw man he's himself second the dev questions these
days they're all the same ones yeah I keep throwing them at you and I'm really sorry it's fine I don't I don't mind it oh man sorry I'm getting a little stuffy but I don't I don't feel very well either thanks for watching the L show we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel you ready to get crushed in front of a live audience Luke super if I don't fall asleep before I get    yeah
