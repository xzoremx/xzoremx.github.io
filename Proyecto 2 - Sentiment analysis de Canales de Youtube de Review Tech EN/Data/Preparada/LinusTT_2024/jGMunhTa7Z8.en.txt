if 2023 was the year of practical AI applications then 2024 is the year of grabbing the nearest object holding it down and duct taping that AI to it we've got everything from AI enabled monitors that identify and indicate where your enemies are we found the bike with integrated chat GPT hey how am I doing buddy ped hotter idiot we've got this humanoid robot from AI life that is for entertainment purposes even the promotional materials for the big Tech Conference in Las Vegas are AI generated
making it clear that the industry is all on when it comes to Ai and I'm all on board to tell you about our sponsor headphone juice is not something you should be proud of these are your typical headphones that accumulate heat while you game e Wicked cushions added cooling gel to their cushions to keep your ears sweat free you can easily replace them on your headset check out Wicked cushions and the link below one AI enabled product that has sparked debate even controversy in The Gaming
Community is msi's AI enabled monitor which as you can see is popping up indicators completely independent of your operating system or your game files Whenever there is an enemy hero coming into the frame in League of Legends now MSI makes the argument that this isn't cheating because all it's doing is watching the mini map for you so in theory it's not doing anything a skilled player couldn't already do on their own but by that logic why not highlight your opponents in CS2 or draw an AI generated
racing line in Mario Kart of course of these things exist already the difference is that it's being handled by a neural processor inside the monitor making it impossible for the game developer to detect now from my tone you can probably tell how I feel about AI assistants that unlevel the playing field but I also see the argument from the other side is it really any different from having a higher quality mouse or a better internet connection whichever side you're on it's clear that
League of Legends opponent detection is just the tip of the iceberg here with MSI claiming that users will be able to train an AI model on different games or in the future even on the audio that streams through the monitor to unlock new gaming advantages So Ready or Not Here It Comes AI voice Mouse really yes really the tgsd from test gift has three things that make it AI starting with a dedicated microphone button on the side that handles Voice to Text input so you never need a keyboard again that's a
bold claim visit LTT store.com to get  merchandise not bad other than the URL not perfect but In fairness that was a lot less typing than entering that manually number two is the dedicated voice translation button simply enter your primary language and your secondary language a voila visit LTT store.com to get great deals on  merchandise that is actually a really unimaginative but good translation finally it offers a super convenient interface for text to text translations automatically
detecting The Source language and spitting out an English translation so that hey look at that I can read comments on our billybilly videos now I can practically hear you screeching finus I am already sitting at my computer why would I use the processor in a mouse for translation and the answer is you shouldn't and there's no processor in here the real product is the software which is using Google's commercial voice to text and AI translation products in order to provide
a seamless experience they do have some special sauce for people who regularly work in multiple languages like the dedicated buttons and the ability to over time adapt to your particular idiosyncrasies next up we've got the etopia fusion the world's first dual motor dual battery ebike and also the world's first with chat GPT it boasts a 200 km range while weighing just 20 kg and dual processors one for the motors and another connected via Camus up here in the head unit and this is where
things get really interesting it's got cellular connectivity and an open API meaning that pretty much any service with an API can be integrated into the bike not just chat GPT this one doesn't have the latest firmware though so let's hop over there and check out the demo it's not keyed for my fingerprint so fortunately it's already unlocked we got to do is hold this button what do you think of the LT store trust me bro guarantee trust me bro guarantee may be perceived as a catchy marketing slogan
that resonates with some customers there are some limitations for now each interaction creates a new prompt rather than retaining the context of your previous prompt but makes more sense than I thought it would and chat GPT is far from the most interesting API integration many of their users for example are already enjoying their apple Health integration which allows allows your heart rate to be synchronized from your Apple watch to the display on the bike and they're currently in talks with
an AI coaching software partner that could unlock functionality like monitoring your state of restfulness and Advising you about how hard you should be working or even automatically adjusting motor output to make sure that you're maintaining a reasonable heart rate even the chat GPT integration isn't as silly as it sounds on the surface given that biking is absolutely a use case where hands-free operation could make sense you know hey tell me a great route to travel to all the sites in Las
Vegas it throws that over to your navigation software and you're Off to the Races next up is the sear grills Booth where the stakes have never been higher they bet everything on their first product an AI powered Grill and I got to confess it looks pretty cool or hot a big part of the reason they call cooking an art is because there's just too many variables for it to be a science there's environmental ones like the ambient temperature and humidity food variables like the type of Cuisine
and the thickness and even user preference variables like hey do you want it medium medium well medium medium well and what level of sear do you prefer but the perfecta Grill has a couple of superpowers that help it balance all of these factors starting with the unique burners each of these "can reach temperatures of up to, 1600Â°" fit and is on a motor so that it can control the distance from the meat or pizza as it were in the center where the AI comes in is optimizing the user
experience for every extra second that it takes to cook your food it gets punished so they say they can do three RI eyes in as little as 90 seconds but don't worry it's not going to skimp on quality because it also gets punished if you tell it hey you did a bad job which unlocks some really cool functionality both for you as the individual because I'm sure you like enjoying your food but also for even things like Regional awareness you know in Texas rare might look more like blue in Vancouver it
Cooks vertically for optimal Browning and easy clean up with their dishwasher safe cleanup tray and dishwasher safe grills and it's not cheap but it'll do Steak Burgers chicken and even a 10 and 1/2 inch pizza and they've even got a rotary skewer attachment and for the folks out there who hate AI art even cooking art they've got a chef profile which allows you to tune the temperature and position of the burners manually and then let the AI kind of fine-tune it according to the
results there's the AI mattress with air ride technology that adapts to your body as you move around ducci's t11 AI mattress may not be cheap coming in at "$9,000 but it is jam-packed full of" sensors that can monitor your heart rate your breathing your wakefulness and yes even the pressure on the mattress itself which it uses to algorithmically adjust the air cushion I inside the mattress to ensure that you get the most comfortable possible sleep now I haven't tried it yet I'm I'm sleeping now I'm sleeping
okay that's trippy it almost feels like the lumbar support in a chair you know you know pushing my rump up oh my god it feels like I'm sinking into quicksand a little bit like it's filling in the arch of my back and it's like it's giving me like a hug come here come to sleep not in a really creepy way okay okay okay  though the closest analog I have to this is an air suspension in a vehicle you know like you press a little thing and it's like you know it's that I don't know
that sound now our fashion team tells me that I have unusually wide hips for a man which I take as a compliment but it can affect sleep comfort and I don't think I've ever encountered anything that compensates for it quite like this does does it's like there's a little like yeah come you know put your hip in here pocket definitely cool just one small problem there's nothing AI about it it's algorithmic there's no way to input any feedback and have it adjust its approach in the future this isn't a
booth but it gives you some idea of how hype AI is here we're in the AI aisle at AI life they're showing off Zoe who will'll get to in a minute and Coco a virtual companion who's designed to detect your emotional state hardship hazardous objects and situations like knives and fire and engage a natural conversation with a customizable Avatar which they imagine will make her great for things like elder care facilities and teaching kids with learning disabilities I think
I'm going to have to get pretty close to the microphone but let's go ahead and see if we can interact Coco my family hasn't come to visit what can I do I would suggest reaching out to your family and expressing how much you miss them and with would love for them to come visit meanwhile Zoe has a lot in common with Coco but some extras that make her more for entertainment she can recite lines using text to speech move her head move her jaw she actually sees out of cameras positioned in her eye
sockets and she can also move her arms making her perfect for animatronic Museum exhibits next up is the pla note from pla AI a voice recorder for recording your lectures conversations or meetings then synchronizing those recordings to your phone transcribing them and creating an index of all the main topics which I guess is perfect for "the 35,000 people who just backed them" who don't have a phone actually the pitch is a lot better than it sounds and this is why this toggle switch on the
top switches between meeting recording mode and phone call recording mode which if you're an iPhone user you'll know is not natively supported on the device there's also the convenience factor it's sitting right there all you do is hold the button until it buzzes once now it's recording and hold it again when it buzzes twice it's all done they boast 30 hours of continuous recording and about 16 days of standby time meaning that you shouldn't be topping it up very often on
the subject of charging even if your phone is completely dead you can still record audio files to the device then pull them off with the magnetic USB charging cable or you can just wait and sync them with your phone when you get back back to the wall the only main issue I have with this is that because it's powered by chat GPT there are some privacy concerns I uh wouldn't recommend using this if you work for a  agency we found this robot dog from unit Tre who is such a good boy and this one
who's more of an ominous boy they're showing off a whole lineup of Machine Vision and chat GPT enabled robot dogs including to the one and only Stevie Wonder right now future right over here the big one targets industrial applications with a cost match but this guy starts at $1600 and is targeting the entertainment fun and educational markets entertainment and fun are kind of the same thing it features facial recognition and through chat GPT it will listen to instructions and respond play
music and even take photos their app allows you to see from the dog's point of view and the optional phone doc gives you a surprisingly Grand man amount of control over its movement and pre-programmed actions of course you don't have to manually control it with a tracking module in your pocket it will follow you around using this liar on the front for obstacle detection it has a graphical programming interface allowing students for example to create their own pre-programmed routines and it can do
everything from sit to roll over to climb stairs to run at speeds of up to 18 km an hour although they have some concerns about safety at those speeds and all three models are limited to a bit lower than that battery life is about an hour or two for the go-to air and the goto Pro and anywhere from 2 to 4 hours for the go-to edu which comes with an extended battery not to mention a whole host of other features including compatibility with upgraded docking modules a little like Servo arm and all
kinds of cool stuff although that one starts at like "$10,000 I made a wonderful new friend" who will make me any drink I want and asks nothing in return money behind me is the bartending robot Adam who's actually capable of not just bartending he's running a barista program right now and can also make boba but that's not new what's new is his glowing blue chest piece which is an Nvidia powered camera module that allows Adam to detect incoming customers and make conversation
with them using a large language model that isn't chat GPT but fundamentally Works in a similar Manner and in the future they're working on on logic that will allow Adam to identify any foreign objects that are in his way and adjust his movements to compensate that's not done yet though so let me get that out of your way he's the first commercially deployed humanoid bartending robot with seven permanent installations and they rent them out for events as well he can do drinks as
complicated as a salted Rim Margarita though that takes about 2 minutes each and can do a draft beer fill in about 10 seconds and he can dual wield it as well which is pretty cool they say that a trained bartender will obviously be able to make drinks faster but because Adam is not distractable he should on average be able to keep up I'm not going to drink this this is Davids here go David that's really good realistically there was definitely some Innovation there but also some stuff that pretty
much already existed and in previous years would have been called iot or 5G I'll let you guys be the judge just like you can judge me for this terrible segue to our sponsor are you have most Christians how like a tiny steam room stop steaming your ears like your broccoli W cushions offer all sort of cushion replacement for your headphones and it's not just your regular cushions with add a dual layer cooling gel they ensure you keep a cool head even your team is feeding looking for a crack
wikied cushion give you a crack-free comfort they use topnotch materials like breathable sport Fabric and memory form "with over 25,000 reviews and a 365 days" to fall in love warranty don't listen to me listen to your ears this time check out Wicked cushions and the link below if you guys enjoyed this video this will probably be the last one that comes out so go back and check out some of our other CES coverage
