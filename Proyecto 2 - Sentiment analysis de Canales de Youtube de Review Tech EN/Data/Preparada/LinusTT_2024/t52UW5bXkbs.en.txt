you ever see those videos with thermal goop all over the CPU socket or people jamming things into high-powered fans and thought hm what would happen if I did that to my PC well that's bad first of all you could get hurt or worse you could damage your computer so instead of risking it let us indulge your intrusive thoughts like what would happen if you used your monitor in the Arctic can liquid crystals freeze we're about to try all of this and more but my friends heed this warning do not try this at
home instead try this segue to our sponsor Ridge okay drop everything our LTT circuit board Ridge wallet collaboration is live designed by our very own Sarah but it is sure to stand out and hold up too thanks to ridge's meticulous focus on quality grab one today using our Link in the video  in theory modern highquality pastes are both non-conductive and non-capacitive so this might work okay but even if it's non-conductive wouldn't that block the pads from touching my theory is that the
mounting pressure is going to be so high that it's going to kind of mash it out kind of like when you mount a heat sink and it's not mashing out as much as I might have hoped but there's a lot of mounting pressure on the CPU and these are older larger pins uh and guys this was already a motherboard that was a little bit flaky don't worry we want to sacrifice something that works perfectly Works enough to find out if it works though shut up no way clearly we haven't put enough thermal paste in
oh for round two we're bringing out the big guns all right that should be enough that she's going to squeeze out like  no this is crazy oh boy okay I think this is our final stage here our ratio of thermal paste under the CPU to thermal paste on top of the CPU is extremely high so we should probably get some more paste on top yeah that's good that's good you know you've always wanted to try it no what if we run something like actually CPU intensive like cinn bench or something sure I can do that 62° on
the CPU she's flying how is this allowed I don't know but it's great because we kind of need this system for our next intrusive thought inside this environmental chamber is a liquid crystal display but just because they're liquid at room temperature doesn't mean that they are always liquid they can freeze what is the rated temperature of this monitor it doesn't say but most are rated to 0° while in operation andus 20 while in storage so that seems like a sensible starting point this is so gross
it feels worse than even just the motion blur like it almost feels like it leaves an imprint of the starting frame on my eye before anything even starts moving at all it it's like you're permanently recovering from a flashbang yeah it's like that exact effect it reminds me of a flashbang where it leaves that previous image imprinted that's what I was looking for my question now is what happens if we goow lower there's no water in the display so we don't need to worry about the liquid expanding as it
freezes and breaking the monitor so uh it's starting to get to the point where this is so nauseating that it I need to look away from it for a minute but that's great because I need to talk about what's going on here it shouldn't be the crystals themselves freezing those should be good down to as low as -60 but what does happen is they start to gel up which increases the resistance that the display interface needs to overcome in order to twist them so what we're looking at here is the most
extreme example of how pixel response times affect the gaming experience because both of these displays are running at 60 refreshes per second it's just that the pixels take so long to reach the new state we end up with this blurry flash bangy drunk goggles image oh man I don't know if we're going to make it to minus 400 this is damn near unplayable you see that just like with a flashbang I almost had yeah who who who who it looks like it's kind of changing in the background a little bit on some
parts of the display oh did you see that the very top of the display is still refreshing but the rest isn't so again what we're seeing is the way a screen refreshes is typically from top to bottom so it's going like okay here's a new here's a new oh here we go this is really interesting too now we can see that the red pixels are or sub pixels rather seem to be having the hardest time twisting so maybe their viscosity is higher as temperatures go down we're only at - 32 right now I really don't think we're
going to make it to- 40 I think she's done bud can she even get a static image up there it's kind of starting to kind of do something I think it's fair to say she didn't make it to - 40 come on out little buddy sorry about that oh hey look at that she only had to get a little bit warmer on the very front for it to be able to display an image again I got to get this unplugged before she gets Frosty though good job buddy here's a fun one you've probably heard about solar flares and
how dangerous they can be for computer systems here on Earth and well we don't have a sun but what we do have is a CT scanner from Luma field that we can use to blast Cosmic like X-rays at stuff like hey this computer all we got to do is close our up and configure a couple of things while lus is working on that I have some dark urges of my own while everyone knows that you should eject your USB before you pull it out so that you don't corrupt your files what would happen if I pulled out maybe the whole
SSD we're currently playing valheim and it's installed on this drive right here we're walking around the world look at  just look at that we're still playing the game now when you're using your computer the stuff that you're actively using is going to be sitting in Ram so we should be fine for now we can look around we can jump we can punch stuff like we're still playing the game but  something it goes away but you see Windows is still running because we haven't removed our boot drive so what
would happen if we did that look at that it's crazy it's it still works that's because Windows is mostly running in Ram right now you can actually get entire operating systems that will run exclusively in Ram but this isn't one of them and you'll see that when we say try to look at file explorer look at file look at there could be some very important information traveling between the SSD and your RAM and it could end up causing severe harm to your system you're probably going to be okay but hey
why are you tempting fate that's what we're doing we tempted and it's for those very reasons that you probably expect that when we pull out our Ram it shuts down immediately ooh spicy this is what I mean you don't know what you're going to screw up and now we're in a repair mode let's hope that it doesn't slow us down too much obviously taking Ram out is going to be a problem but what would happen if we just you know put Ram in I'm I'm so surprised I thought that we would plug it in it would trip
voltage monitor or something there' like be a short circuit because of the connecting of the pins and whatever we don't have 16 GB of RAM right now we're still stuck as if we were running off of the single dim what if can I take this one out now hey maybe that was a fluke let's try this a second time you still get the RGB we've seen some crashes and stuff but I just feel like we haven't actually done any damage what if we delete system 32 and delete it's that easy except for
it isn't Windows actually doesn't want you to break your own PC and so it asks for trusted installer permission to delete the folder and it won't let you get any further from this even if you're an administrator it doesn't matter but I know of a tool the command line that will let us do anything we want watch as  command as and then when I also say yes to all it's a lot of red unauthorized access exception why can't I I have a computer that just listens to what I tell it to do I think I know a guy who
knows about computers and making them do what he wants it's Jordan ah yes the command line one final reminder before we do this don't deleting system 32 will harm your computer if you understand this warning hit the like button to proceed just down there all right open up the command line as an administrator and type this in congratulations you now own all the folders in system 32 you've massively compromised the security and the functionality of your PC but we're not done yet let's confirm this kill use
this next command to change your Access Control level and now we just delete  32 okay so we removed a lot of files but why is Windows still working what if we try like doing something well you've angered it this is all your fault control shift Escape control delete oh failure to display security and I've never seen that before me neither I like the just X just X do you want to try rebooting it yeah okay automatic repair oh my it's so bored it can't do anything it's booting into here that implies that 
32 I think this computer's sufficiently borked okay um my work here is done yes you've done a wonderful job now it's my turn Adam's making me do this it'll be  yeah don't worry it's l free yeah this isn't as satisfying as I had hoped not only is it not fun it's a waste of solder yeah really is let's do something slightly less stupid PC fans at their core are basically just an electric motor you apply some power to it it spins your fan but if you are the one that spins it suddenly your electric
motor becomes an electric generator let's test it here we have a multimeter connected to a fan a tachometer and some  air now let's spin it and kill the motherboard given that we only saw like 6 volts on the multimeter here when we spun this fan up I think the motherboard's going to be fine these are 12vt fans the header can probably handle 12 volts here's the graph of our fan "speed it's currently spinning at 2,000" RPM and if we just give it a little bit of encouragement here there we go look at that
we need the graph to go higher all right we're at a 7500 RPM whatever reason it think it's going "1,000 RPM now that is not" correct huh it's fine it's totally fine the RPMs for whatever reason went down to like 900 RPM when it was going over "7,000 but I'm guessing that's just the" math getting screw when it goes way faster than expected but according to this it went up to 7 7600 RPM and she's totally fine I don't think you have to worry about this too much but you know
what you definitely have to worry about water I don't know why I said it like that water technically water doesn't damage your computer pure water isn't conductive it's what's disolved inside the water that counts this isn't pure water though so this is probably pretty bad so Adam's currently playing crisis and he's just going to keep playing until this computer stops working is it still going it's going fine yeah we're doing totally fine see spraying water on computers
again can be fine until that shoo builds up unfortunately everything's got shoo in it so at some point this will give out is it still going no oh game over would you like me to keep going yeah I think we should stop okay the fans are still spinning the power supply has not tripped yeah despite you spraying directly into the back of it why is there thermal paste all over the CPU yeah the Linus 5 hours later we're coming back to our system that we put inside the Luma field and am I
expecting there to be anything wrong with it it didn't even so much as crash well here's the thing this blasts x-rays which I don't know if you've ever been to an airport but your laptop goes through an x-ray reader every time you go on there sure and as long as your laptop isn't a you know analog film camera then it's probably not going to have an issue with that yeah at first Luma field does publish guidelines for how long is safe to expose Electronics to their machine and
they're pretty long and they're probably padding the estimates yeah and even if we were trying to guarantee that something went wrong with this who knows if it would actually affect something that matters on what we're doing on our system we saw this actually when we tried to EMP blast literally the RAM chips on a laptop we had to get like right in there   so if you ever want to bring your laptop to your next CAT scan you can totally do that tell the doctors that we said it
was okay do you know what else is okay a segue to our sponsor grammarly the business team at Linus media group's day-to-day involves a ton of communication coordination and writing that's where grammarly comes in it's an AI writing partner that works where the biz team works for example if they need to draft up an email for a project proposal grammarly can help come up with initial ideas and can check for clarity in tone and ensure that their email is as effective as it can be
