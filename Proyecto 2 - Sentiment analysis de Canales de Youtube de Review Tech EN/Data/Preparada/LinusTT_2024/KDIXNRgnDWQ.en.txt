welcome to the W show we've got a great show for you guys today and look Luke I know we have this thing where I pick two topics for the show and then you pick two topics for the show and you're always all like man those two topics were the ones that I wanted to do so I think I have the solution okay I'll just do all the topics we're going to be talking about the framework 16 Apple complying with the EU but like only sort of not really the HP CEO saying the quiet part out loud we're going to be
talking about uh uh uh uh uh now you're the one searching crap this is hard yeah there's like two good [Laughter] ones okay pick one more go uh I was going to do teenager criminally charged for Snapchat joke yeah really wow well   the show today is brought to you by ag1 Squarespace and a vessie why don't we jump right into our headline topic which is of course Apple's compliance with the eu's regulations that are forcing them to behave less like a Walled Garden and more like a f garden with Barb Wire
Around It Dummy um yeah so okay apple is being accused of malicious compliance with the European Union's digital markets act or dma after detailing its plans to add support for thirdparty app stores thirdparty payment systems and browser engines other than Safari to iOS in the European Union in a news release Apple repeatedly emphasized that the dma opens new avenues for malware fraud and scams and illicit and harmful content and other privacy and security threats now here's here's what
I'd like to know yeah Apple's a very privacy and Security First company aren't they yes so then with all the resources that they have with the are they at hundreds of billions of dollars of cash reserves right now probably yeah and with all the with all the people in the tech industry that are in need of work right now I would like to know Apple what investments you're making to ensure that as an iPhone user in the European Union I'm not going to be affected by this stuff no seriously though Apple's one of
those companies that this is very unlike them to acknowledge any potential flaw in their product even if it is caused by compliance with a third party regulation they don't like to talk about that yeah they like to talk about safety and security and privacy and the Apple experience it you can tell they are at they are at the desperation stage to try  apple has a solution Apple has instituted multiple safeguards inqu including requiring Apple authorization of all developers on alternative of alternative app
marketplaces a letter of credit of a million EUR in order to launch an alternative app store disclosure of alternative payments  notorized humans so basically apple is saying okay you can have your own store but the only way that we could possibly ensure the security of the iPhone is if um we're basically like in charge of it and also you pay us a bunch of money a lot um Apple will be reducing their current fees a 10% fee for subscriptions a 177% fee for digital goods and services and
an additional 3% for using Apple's payment system however Apple will also be adding a new core technology fee so once an app Hits 1 million installs its devs will have to pay 50 cents is that what they're actually called Euro cents yeah I don't know 50 half of a Euro for every new user who installs it on iOS annually that is wild okay anyway the app can be reinstalled by the same user for no charge for 12 months though wow it's actually Euro cents this applies to paid apps and free apps Apple says they
will have an install verification mechanism to avoid install spam because I'm sure it'll be like totally in their interest to ensure that you know the experience on third party app stores is really good that they've really they've really telegraphed that um Apple has provided a fee calculator and some devs have found that under some circumstances Apple could take as much as 60% of their yearly Revenue nice developers of alternative app stores need to pay the CTF for every every first annual
installation including the first [Laughter] million oh man but don't worry don't worry there's an alternative if developers don't like this deal right good well they can stay under Apple's current business terms and remain exclusively on the App Store where no thirdparty marketplaces or Payment Systems will be allowed so is the only way to get an alternative store onto the the platform by Distributing the alternative store through the App Store I actually do not know that is a
really good that's what it sounds like through their terms cuz how could they charge you if you didn't get it through the App Store Luke how does that make any sense Luke I'm not sure I'm I'm sure that uh when it comes when it comes to collecting your money um I think Apple will find a way it's unclear how Apple will authorize and distribute the alternative marketplaces yeah huh maybe their hope is that this deal will be technically compliant with the eu's guidelines not guidelines laws
uh but be so bad that nobody will actually do it Tim Tim Sweeney has been going off has he oh yeah yeah oh man he's been he's been going off and to be clear I do not agree with Tim Sweeney about everything in fact we've like had personal beef at one point a while ago but yeah but what he is right about just just because just because I don't agree with someone once doesn't mean I can't agree with them when they say something correct like I'm not saying Hitler was  no I was going to say something specific
I don't know maybe he said something about how trains should be on time or something I don't know I don't actually I don't actually I haven't memorized any any quotes Okay uh my point is just that just because I disagree with someone about something doesn't mean I can't acknowledge when they're right about something maybe the chair was comfy and Mr Sweeney the chair some people will get that it's fine oh okay Mr Sweeney is  man yeah Luke some people got it good okay look what you've done
what how so so Mr Sweeney is 100% correct here when he says that Apple is is absolutely behaving in an anti-competitive way the EU has called them out on it in a very in a very clear way and Apple has gone out of their way to ensure that the manner in which they've complied with the eu's new regulations is as awful as humanly possible also we had talked before about okay if apple is forced to allow additional Marketplace and all of that well how is it going to affect people
outside the EU it looks like the answer is not one bit Apple will be maintaining its monopolistic Behavior anywhere that it is allowed to so if you want anything to change and change it can and should I mean Apple has demonstrated that they can have lower subscription fees as long as they can charge you a what what is it a um core technology fee man this is this is bizarre like why why do why do people defend this kind of double dipping Behavior I don't know you see a lot of it though it's like it's triple
dipping actually first they charge the user for the device then they charge the developer just to have a developer account oh no we're up to quadruple dipping now for then they charge the developer to have a developer account then they charge you a core technology fee if you actually have a very successful app then they charge you a 10% fee on subscriptions 177% for digital goods and services at what point does it end well you also have to use their payment system like we mock this kind of thing
when it's the cable when it's the cable company but realistically most people have as many options for cable companies as they do for major cell phone platforms and so the people who say well Apple's not a monopoly because Android exists it's like okay okay okay right but that doesn't you can have a duopoly then it doesn't change the you can have monopolistic Behavior people compare it to steam and I'm I'm not here to defend steam's 30% take either but not even a little but on a computer you could use
things that aren't steam well yeah that and steam actually has as far as I can tell steam doesn't charge epic games money to sell games on their platform no And as far as I can tell steam doesn't charge game devs any ongoing fees for the original purchase of the game so you have a game that's 160 GB you could download that game now and forever not to mention all the cloud synchronization of your save files remember Nintendo is going to charge you like what eight bucks a month per user to sync your
Cloud save to sync your saves to the cloud like steam is actually operating a platform that actually delivers value to the user I want to buy games on Steam whereas what is Apple actually doing I mean yeah they handle downloading sure but the infrastructure by comparison when we're talking downloads that are 160 gigabytes in many cases and we're talking downloads that are 160 megabytes and that's a pretty decent sized app I mean you'll get multi- gigabit H gigabit you'll get multi- gigabyte mobile apps
uh especially for games but there'll be three or four typically not not hundreds and to be clear I just want to make this clear Apple's operating at an enormous scale on the App Store but don't kid yourself so is valve yeah gaming it's kind of a thing yeah um yeah and like uh people are bringing up like oh you can buy an Android and it's like okay so there's the whole duopoly thing also we're talking about Platforms in general we don't think Android is necessarily better off here the the uh Play Store is
also terrible um just you can technically it's not a very clean process but you can sideload on on Android um and the the steam example this would be like if the only way that you could get any apps on Windows was the Microsoft store I know I just gave everyone nightmares I apologize for that um but it would be as if that was the only way and for steam or something else to exist Microsoft is going to take a cut of it yeah just for valve having the privilege to be allowed to have steam yeah that's
pretty crap is that a thing that you would like is that a thing that you would defend do you think that would have made would that have made the PC what it is today someone said you mean like on Windows RT I know practically nothing about Windows RT but if that's how it would work that's not something I would defend uh does Windows RT even exist anymore I don't know Windows RT is a mobile operating system designed by first unveiled January 2011 oh final release January 10th 2023 12 months ago
so is it is it still a thing is it not a thing I suspect it's supported extended support was ended January 10th 2023 never mind so yeah that's how good it is  nice yeah windows for would be the replacement for Windows RT uh and my understanding is nothing on Windows for arm would prevent you from just downloading an application and installing it in fact I was uh man was I was installing something the other day I was saying f s mode but you can turn S Mode off can you not yeah yeah so like
what are you talking about yeah if I can if I can voluntarily make my phone only allow apps to be installed from the app store that's fine like this is I don't know man this is like the the I don't understand these arguments this is well okay a lot of the a lot of the Apple argument boils down to well you you do have a choice I I like the locked down experience sure and it's like right so then sit down and shut the up yeah I don't yeah and I should be allowed to install whatever software I feel like on
this thing that I mean it's not it's not like apple gives away the iPhone if Apple gave away the iPhone this would be a completely different conversation like okay for example remember that TV Luke that TV that uh watches you and plays ads or whatever if that's the deal okay the hardware is free you watch as much TV as you want and they're like yeah we're going to we're going to bombard you with ads it's going to be pay to playay for anyone who wants to be part of this ecosystem and have their ads
displayed or whatever it's like yeah sure fine but my understanding when I pay full pop and don't kid yourself Apple's not discounting the iPhone they're not subsidizing the cost of the iPhone with the app store they are just they they are charging as much if not more they're taking more margin than pretty much any I think any other handset maker as far as I can tell um so when I pay full price for something my understanding and your understanding should be that it belongs
to you and so the fact that any one is not offended by this that anyone sees this behavior and goes yeah this is good it's just baffling to me and if you make the choice to only use the app store by all means but when I say I shouldn't have to again sit down and shut the up it's that simple yeah nice oh Dan's not here to move the the the the cards how will we know what to do he's supposed to tell us through our well we don't need 10 more minutes because we both agreed that apple is
being buttheads yeah I'm really looking forward to trying the Vision Pro though yeah yeah real heavy yeah we're getting our hands on uh we're getting our hands on one February 4th I think ours arrives you got to do neck workouts um okay I I am not I don't know how exaggerated this I am not doing any neck workouts I am going to I'm going to go in cold and see if it's overblown as someone who regularly wears headphones and who regularly vrs I suspect that it's not going to
bother me as much as people who do not regularly V how much does it weigh versus like an index but I have heard it is quite heavy yes please show Dan cam okay a wild Dan appears there's Dan oh sorry I mean a wild um NAD appears a non non a nonin  coincidental does anyone see where I'm going with this uh I don't really get the point we we copied the it's a very similar character model but it's not the same thing oh so like pal world I'm don't worry about it n stands for  Dan I may of AI
now yeah I I apologize in advance for the fact that NAD is probably going to   what uh looks like the index weigh more yeah it looks like the index weighs more than the Vision Pro so it's going to be fine then yeah so it's probably going to be fine what's everyone freaking out about I it's apple right so on the one hand you have the things that Apple does that are actually really scummy yeah and then you've got people that are just like no man this seems fine and then on
the other hand you've got what appears to be a very compelling product that could change Computing we'll see and people are like oh my God it needs to be cooled they need Cooling in it and there's like there's glass lenses is and glass is heavy H it's like people are saying cuz it's not as well balanced and and because the strap apparently isn't as good the index ain't that well balanced I I would have hoped that Apple would get the strap right though I mean then again that's
like I don't know kind of their thing is they have okay accessories and then other people fill in the gaps so maybe it's maybe it's fine um one thing I'm really excited for though is that apparently it comes with Apple's cleaning cloth now we missed the initial outrage train on the $40 cleaning cloth oh it's included though yeah yeah yeah so we so we we were like well realistically there's no point making a video about this because people have kind of got it out of their system now but it's not
like it ever went away so I'm going to get an opportunity to check out Apple's cleaning cloth nice yeah yeah I can't believe it's free I'm pretty stoked on that um I I I I doubt it's going to get much airtime in the video I've I've kind of said my piece about Apple's pricing we did a video a number of years ago when they announced the $700 wheels for the old Intel Mac Pro was that the 2019 Mac Pro or whatever I have to memorize years instead of just Generations because I don't know Apple things um
where where I basically talked about how it's it's it has yeah it has I I actually forget my point but it was a good point and it pretty much explained why Apple prices things the way they do it's because they want to be a luxury brand they're a consumer electronics brand but they really really really really really want to be a luxury brand and that's an image that they project um and it's an image that some people buy like it's the whole blue bubble green bubble thing has always been baffling to
me you can get iPhone for like $100 on eBay that'll like you get your bubble color whatever who cares um I I they should change the shade I don't really see how on the generation of phone can you not give them ideas or no no the newest the newest one should be the deepest blue and as your phone ages it should fade you that way that way they don't have to like update they're never going to like run out of Blues you know because it'll just get worse UV reactive paint kind of thing uh
Luke you do know that people from Apple watch this show right they don't acknowledge us but I have heard from people at  mad you got to have dude the new generation of phone comes out your bubbles are going to be less blue so you guys can see why it's a good thing that Luke is not evil cuz if he was he'd be an evil genius oh I could work at the geni please mute Luke if he can do it to you you need to do it D yeah Dan I think we've established now that I should have a Luke mute
button I don't know about that I think Dan's with me on this Dan I'm setting it up right now thank you he would too good guy Dan uh all right what's our next topic here okay okay this one's going to be kind of open-ended okay our topic is the framework 16 yeah so what I have only spent about two minutes with it okay I actually haven't watched our review yet okay I didn't read it okay so I would like you I haven't even read our topic notes sure I would like you to tell me if it's any
good okay do you want me to silently read the topic notes or okay because there's positive and negative points all right so yeah the framework 16 is finally out we released a full review this week which was written and hosted without pretty well received by the community by the way lus involvement and yes I do I do believe it was other outlets have reviewed the 16 quite positively Alex wro from Tom's guide called it the laptop I'd buy for myself some of the positive points are extreme
modularity and repairability framework says that the graphics card can be swapped in just a few minutes which both we and The Verge were able to replicate that I've tried remember I have played around with the like something yeah like a mechanical sample right quite a while back so even ear yeah but I haven't touched uh I haven't touched I have spent about 2 minutes with the final one that we that we have here great future proofing potential and customizability compared to other laptops of note the
fully customizable keyboard deck and six expansion card slots to the framework 13s 4 good screen quality easily outperformed similar laptops running the same graphics card in terms of cooling and then we come to the negative points okay now hold on a second there's a couple of things here that from just chatting with people internally I I know that we didn't necessarily agree with in our video so one of them is that Jake had some concerns about backlight bleed or not bleed but like a um un even
backlighting at the edges of the screen did anybody else have any kind of feedback on that like I'm this is this is a highly interactive section guys I want to hear from you in the chat do other people have this laptop or are you asking about other people's reviews asking about other people's reviews understood yeah cuz the Verge according to Noki uh the one and only timestamp guy people are suggesting that we react to the video live we would be able to do that cuz it's our own video The Verge
rated it five out of 10 the screen no the whole thing whoa yeah so not everybody gave it a good review although The Verge did complain about crashing issues um so I would say that would probably significantly impact the score and I didn't I didn't from the conversations I've had with plof and Jake they didn't say anything about crashing on our unit and John uh John from the lab didn't bring it up with me either interesting I fix it according to focus Forte and DNA gecko I fix it I gave it a 10 out of 10
for repairability I guess okay people want a live reaction Dan is that something you can do from there because Dan is not in the studio oh The Verge has some interesting points here I'm I'm going to jump to my screen real fast yeah yeah for sure I I want to know what's going on man this this is my investment yo that doesn't look good what is that he's trying to lift the screen with one finger oh which I could do with like this one and it's not going to do that uh I mean this one does that 
look that doesn't look like as much as in that photo is it because of the angle  it no it's less than that yeah it's less than that that is a lot of of screen Bend you're going to have a little bit you know if you try to lift a screen by the corner you're going to have a little bit but that in the photo is quite a lot um I don't see where they did the  top I like your sound effects thank you uh that's not the very top Luke  it contrl F5 oh there it is GRE green big green box got it he's got this
what's it out of 10 okay yeah not five yeah they said the good is fully user repairable unprecedented customization competent mid-range gaming performance and excellent 16 X10 screen they said the bad was regularly froze during testing additional strange glitches often run hot and loud and some of the panels feel flimsy okay I think we need to live react to this okay Dan is that something we can do live Rea you really got to do is pull up the video on your laptop and then I guess that counts as a reaction
Channel um okay well it's it's our own video yeah yeah it's fine to react to your own video I don't know okay I have I have pulled it up I have pulled it up uh what am I uh what am I supposed to do now I just play it will Luke be able to hear it I think I'll send it through your headphones okay okay we're going to we're going to try it we're going to try it AIO from your laptop yet you don't are you sure well I'm not playing it yet it's 18 and a half minutes are we going
to react to the whole thing okay uh we could watch it 1.75 sure okay that'll only take like 13 14 minutes then I'm not going to have uh oh yeah I guess I can watch it there okay sure yeah cool okay we good I've got audio from you elsewhere you have audio from me elsewhere what does that even mean yeah I didn't even fart that's good uh there oh apparently the Verge didn't have a full production unit did we have a full production unit yeah The Verge posted an update that they are
getting a full production unit to redo the review oh where is that I don't oh man I could have told framework not to send a preprod unit for a review yeah they probably shouldn't have done that was an air completely unforced where is  post uh where did they say this I don't know uh noted we're certainly committed to make a from the total list of issues I don't want to just like believe chat right away okay oh yeah okay post from Sean Hollister framework will send us another
lap another framework 16 and here's what it will fix we told framework we had several different stability issues uh so I was a little frustrated to see the company CEO suggest I only encountered one but I'm happy to say framework will send the Verge a final production unit with quite a list of hardware and software fixes okay okay I don't I don't know if they said that they're oh apparently the review units were pre-production units with known issues interesting okay well guys look
I'm uh okay let's watch it then shall we Dan we good to go I think so okay good luck everybody hold on one sec I just want to I just want to fix the the quote from earlier people said like oh they're going to redo their review and stuff I don't think I don't see them actually saying that um and this looks like it's Luke laptop yeah um so this is a post from Sean Hollister saying these things um but then it says it's linking  thread I don't see anywhere that says like we're going to redo our review it
did say in the review that um they would be open to re-evaluating if the issues are fixed I think but that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to do it I mean as someone who I just want to make sure I didn't quote them incorrectly I would take the quote that you just saw on screen as an actual quote not what I said as someone who does this work um I would say that my annoyance level would be extremely high if I found a bunch of issues and then someone was like well it was pre-pro all
those are like fixed and I'm like okay but that's not that's not what I experienced I can only review what is actually in front of me totally um okay we ready yeah that is a great first frame the all new framework 16 is here and I am super excited about it not only because I invested my own money in this company I want because it has several tricks up it sleeve that are genuinely nutty that's right for years companies have struggled to make an upgradable laptop at all let alone one meant for
gaming but it's finally here and did I mentioned that every single part of this machine can be purchased individually on their store and replaced by the end user what world is this unfortunately a world where trying to be objective doesn't change the fact that I have a vested interest in framework success which makes reviewing their products a bit tricky so I don't want you to take my word for it the rest of the script I haven't even read it to recuse myself from our review Alex our resent laptop
con Jake actually active framework 16 pre-order and John from the lab are going to be telling you guys all about it both the good and the bad this is John's first on camera appearance in a Mainline video I think oh cool so I'll be uh I'll I'll be seeing it for the first time nice fingers crossed that they didn't bite off more than they with this thing unlike this easily diges Segway to our sponsor see Sonic more than my own son unlik every laptop I've used everything on the surface is
modular save the power button up here that has a fingerprint sensor in it you can adjust the keyboard and trackpad positioning you can add aad or a macad or if that macro pad is for you they even have these led Matrix displays do these do anything besides reducing battery life no do I really like them yes as neat however the other new party trick the bespoken upgradable removable discreet AMD graphics card is so sick many companies have attempted to put upgradeable Graphics in a laptop in the
past but the upgrade operation has never been something that I recommend the average Tech Enthusiast undertake framework okay we should talk a little bit about why that is um I saw a lot of feedback um either on just like social media on Reddit um I read through the comments on this video cuz that's what I do rather than watching videos you know this yeah um and I saw quite a few people bring up XM mxm it's like oh yeah  job it's like it's like misunderstand the whole situation speedrunning
any% the reason you should do that you should have a leaderboard based on like how fast they commented sorry keep going the problem with mxm which for those of you who aren't familiar with it and I don't blame you because it's been kind of dead for a long time um the mxm is a is a just a smaller version of the PCI Express interface where just the full connector has been drunk a little bit and it's a PCI by 16 interface and then board spec um the problem with mxm is that Nvidia in particular but to my
knowledge AMD as well has never been able to standardize exactly what the layout of the board will be so in theory it's a good idea because you could just have a card that has a GPU and the memory and the vrms on it and you just slide it into a slot on the motherboard it's a sideways slot kind of like an m.2 slot and you just put it in screw it in and boom upgraded GPU the problem with that is that because Nvidia and to my knowledge AMD it's just Nvidia I know in particular has been adamant that they
just give up and don't want to do it and and they've been they've been very oppositional when it comes to any attempts by laptop manufacturers or others to to make mxm a thing um Nvidia and AMD have not been able to standardize where those components are on the board not only that but they haven't been able to standardize what kind of form they might take do they have an IHS are they a be dieye how many chips are there what layout will they be in how much power will they draw and
therefore for how much heat will they dissipate so what's happened is that while mxm is you know a standard it's only a standard in so far as it's a slot everything else about it pretty much had to be redesigned from generation to generation to accommodate the new layout of every component on the board and the new power requirements so what mxm turned into was essentially a way of making sure that your laptop was going to be thicker to accommodate this board that sat on top of another board in this
interface um and that's about it there were still some benefits right like you could have the ability to configure your laptop at the time of ordering and they could put a different GPU in as long as it had been designed with that particular generation in mind but overall this sort of you know GPU upgradable GPU laptop Nirvana that we all thought mxm could help us achieve has not been possible and as for the laptop manufacturers I don't think you're going to see any appetite for it ever again I mean Dell
got burned on it when they promised that they had this alien wear that was going to be upgradeable from one generation to the next and then my understanding is NVIDIA basically was like oh well sorry about that nope the power envelope is much higher so it's not going to happen uh it could have been Dell alien wear that screwed that up I suspect as well that that's what happened with MSI who also said hey we've got this Titan I think it was something something 80 something Titan uh they had this like
big fat laptop that was they were like yeah you're going to be able to upgrade the GP mechanical keyboard that one they ended up getting class action sued for that one because they didn't offer an upgrade because it wasn't possible it turned out um and my understanding is that would have I can't think of anyone whose fault that would have been other than Nvidia uh I can't think of any reason M would have promised that other than that they thought that they had a road map from
their partner that would allow them to provide an upgradeable laptop so the the point I'm getting at with all of this is that this was an innovation and it is one that matters because the way that framework has done it solves a lot of the problems of mxm it doesn't solve all of them I told framework when they initially told me and this is this is quite a while back when they initially told me we're doing a gaming laptop I was like okay you realize that um everyone has tried this and every time it has not
worked and here are the problems and they were like n dog we think we've got this um and I was like okay uh you're you're going to have a lot of problems to solve and one of them they obviously still haven't solved I I asked them I told them I was like look what board partner is going to deliver Nvidia gpus Nvidia maintains iron fisted control over their Partners do you think for a second that like uh you know let's let's pick up you know what I probably know too much so 
manufacturer manufacturer or just brand manufacturer uh Asus sure so let's say pegatron yeah like like a board manufacturer okay there is no doubt in my mind that given you know some time and given the the resources is still called pegatron uh it's complicated okay yeah uh but pegatron 100% exists and and is a wow I thought that was renamed contract manufacturer y um okay so um because it was Pegasus yeah so now it's pegatron and Asus yeah yeah anyway uh the point is given probably weeks
right not even months probably given weeks pegatron could design and manufacture uh a framework module for the framework 16 with an Nvidia something or other they won't because Nvidia needs to sign off on absolutely everything their gpus go into whether you like bought them and they're like yours right or not so that's like how much RAM you can put on the board what kind of uh cooling what kind of you boost clock speeds how much power you're allowed to deliver to it basically
everything even things as stupid as okay we want to do one with a blower style cooler instead of you know an exhaust all the air inside your case cooler cuz it's better for small form factor enthusiasts my understanding allegedly blah blah blah all of that stuff is that Invidia will clamp down on that because they're worried about it cannibalizing their workstation cards which do have that style of cooler because it's more deal for stacking them so this that's what prevents you from stacking up
408s is NVIDIA won't let board Partners build cards that have coolers that better facilitate it it's like you know off right so as far as I can tell framework still hasn't solved that problem if you're someone at Nvidia who is just you know not a completeing um then by all means if you're listening to this advocate for why the you can't just put a GPU on a module and plug it into a laptop because off it doesn't matter just chill I know I probably haven't made the most little spicy today
diplomatic argument for it but it's just this isn't the first time I've been frustrated about this okay yeah yeah yeah whatever invested how you how could you go after your your employer like that in invested in framework or not this isn't the first time that I've talked about this and this isn't the first time that I've been really frustrated by it um I was at uh computex one year I think yeah it must have been computex cuz I don't think Silverstone oh no yeah they used to do CES but not on the show floor
I was on the show floor for sure so it must have been computex um and I had a really frustrating conversation with Silverstone because they had this really cool little egpu back when Thunderbolt external gpus were really starting to take off so this would have been like I don't know four or five years ago or something like that and instead of being designed for desktop graphics cards so like being huge it was designed for little mxm cards mxm they had gotten their hands on it must have been it was
either a 1080 TI or like a 2080 or something this was a long time ago so I don't remember which one it was must have been a 1080 TI probably not cuz it was around the same time that Zotac was doing those super cute little gaming uh like little tiny gaming things that had mxm in them as well and they were like yeah so we made this thing and I was like that is a super cool thing how on on Earth are you going to get any boards for it and they're like well we're advocating for it we're going to board
manufacturers we're going to try and get someone to to build these things for us dead so why can't we have cute little tiny external gpus because you we don't want people putting our gpus in anything that we don't Dain them to be the thing that it goes in just off you know yeah basically yeah like I love the good things Nvidia does in fact we're going to talk about one of them a little bit later um they they've got this cool new AI SDR to HDR thing I have no problem with the
good things Nvidia does but part of acknowledging things as they are is that you call it when something's good and you call it when something is and them refusing to allow anyone to manufacture their gpus into a form factor that they just don't like is  anyway uh some people are asking that we do 1.5 instead of   bonnet he's he's trying to soften up after being so spicy no no I'll get spicy you want you want more spice I got more spice I'm sure I'm sure we'll get there I got more spice people are
commenting look at Alex's hat is that an LT toque oh that's also not that's also not an LTT sweater yeah what's happening it's knock to allow it okay fair enough they're they're they're are  Alex okay ready yeah oh oh I don't have any audio Dan Dan save us oh oh it's my fault well what did I do it looks like it's up I mean I uh here you good you see it I mean I'm I yeah I'm definitely I'm definitely clicking the same thing I  anything why is nothing ever easy you know uh okay it's definitely working through
HDMI you see it D here do you see mine why yep I see yours okay okay maybe we just play mine sh hold on let me just give it let me give it the old unplug and replug and we'll see if mine lights back up and otherwise then uh we'll we'll go to Luke am I back no okay I guess it's going to be luke then all right how far are you in I can't read it I am 225 225 oh I could read it look at me go what a guy look at his eyes my eyes functioned I'm so stoked that was bound to happen at some point
um okay full screen switch to my screen slightly ahead of where you were okay cool ready yeah however says the GPU swap can be done in a couple minutes so let's test that a little quiet first power down the system then unlock the tabs and take off the touchpad and the keyboard open the little plastic flap here covering this is a fair Mount disassembly to swap compon screws and remove it from the system framework includes a screwdriver with this laptop but the not Screwdriver from l store.com
is a little bit nicer thank the screws are captive so you'll be hardress to lose them just make sure you don't lose the interposer itself I'd recommend screwing it back into the GPU once you have that out speaking of which just two more screws and the entire GPU should slide out dang so that's it that whole thing back there is the GPU and that's how they solved it every other GPU swap on a laptop I've done holy heck this was seamless and if you don't have GPU you can just save over half a pound of
weight and an inch of length by just not having a GPU anymore but all of this modularity comes at a steep price possibly for my boss because the keyboard on the framework 16 is frankly unacceptable for a laptop of this price the closest comparison I have is the Acer Nitro 5 which starts at $750 and it is just okay here one sec okay hold on hold on hold on Dan's getting me to do all the things okay is now maximum well testing back you Rea if you don't want GPU you can just save
over half a pound of weight and an inch of length by just not having a GPU anymore but all of this modularity comes at a steep price possibly for my boss because the keyboard on the framework is frankly unacceptable for a laptop of this price the closest comparison I have is the Nitro 5 which starts at $750 and it is just okay at $750 while testing the framework 16 I wasn't able to get up to my full typing speed in particular while doing really quick double presses due to the chassis Flex a
huge disappointment compared to the excellent keyboard on the framework 13 but yeah see that's really frustrating glad brought particularly in this area it has been better in the past yeah because the framework 13 actually has a really solid keyboard and that was one of the things that I highlighted as being particularly impressive about it was that in spite of its modularity and repairability it still had a good keyboard when that was one of the justifications that I could see for not
having a repairable design was that you wanted to maintain chassis stiffness so that you could have a good keyboard and with the keyboard off you can really just see how not supportive this super thin piece of metal is fortunately this framework disassembling only takes about a minute we were able to chuck some pads in the areas where it was squishiest and holy crap that is so much better that's actually maybe more frustrating it seems like the fix was easy um yeah I'm really know okay I'm
not I'm not sure if that's my favorite thing ever um it's cool that you can fix it it's cool that Alex found that yeah that's that's super cool good job good job Alex but I um little questionable on framework this isn't their first laptop yeah so you'd think they'd know Noti something like oh the chassis flexes a lot uh oh and the tech redneck uh says framework sent an email to all pre-orders talking about this and what they're working on to fix it okay cool uh okay hopefully hopefully
they do fix it okay all right just stuff some thermal pads under there we'll see Flex influences a feel of your keyboard is huge and the difference that this mod has made is just night and day with the thermop pads in there this keyboard isn't quite on the level of Asus or Alienware but it comfortably beats MSI and Razer and brings it much more in line with the price while you're modifying things you might want use a coup pieces of electrical tape to remedy some of the small but visible gaps
between the modules but at least the track pad what did he just say it's glass no do not put electrical tape on your laptop that would look way worse that and it would leave horrible horrible horrible residue on it yeah I would prefer the Gap I love Alex but he um he's a tape Enthusiast yeah yes okay yeah there's certain man I forget what all of his favorite tapes are wait could you could you put the tape under no there's Gap even then I wouldn't put it there because it'll get
warm and it'll leave Goo uh use use any other tape there's uh there's like there's black paper tapes that would if that's what you want to do that would work way better for that okay popped with accurate and responsive tracking I just wish it was a little bit bigger another sacrifice for the modularity one decision I really don't understand though are the speakers which fire oh from the side instead of like up at you or bouncing off of the table like everything else to be clear that can
work really well I've seen some really impressive side-firing speakers that use just algorithmic nonsense to sound great but so has Alex and I'm sure he wouldn't bring this up if it wasn't actually a problem yeah fair enough that sounds good for comparison here's a similar priced Lenovo Legion slim 7i okay the noo L noo is not too bad little bit quiet but I would say perfectly acceptable and the framework is uh it's not the worst I've ever heard but it lacks some treble and Bas and
staging get yourself a Bluetooth speaker what is really good though is the dedicated GPU output on the back this is wired directly to the GPU now Jake wrote here that he wants me to complain about this not being a full siiz display port but personally I think this type c is fine so uh one second stupid BM think type c makes sense for a laptop personally we asked and they said that they tried it just wouldn't fit with the giant heat pipes they're using to cool it but for sakes guys you founded your
company on a laptop with modular iio meant to solve the dongle crisis and you're telling me I need to carry one again wait a second modular IO no way I don't know why I didn't think about that we got to see if this works no way look at that John didn't believe it 4K 120 baby which is how I describe the io situation in general with two more iio Lots that's actually pry fun to connect virtually you just have your HDMI module that you just have in the side of the laptop that's connected through the
onboard GPU so that there can be a bit of a performance penalty there if you connect that to an external display it's you know not huge but it's there and then you can just like have that and then you've always got your dongle with you it's like it's like having this the stylus that docks inside your pen or your phone or whatever okay all right that's pretty fun I'm happy Jake tested that that's pretty funny mod for USBC capable of 240 W charging usba a display port HDMI 2.0 micro SD 2.5 g ethernet
audio and expanded storage but they also release the design so literally anyone with the right skills can design and sell their own modules including for the GPU slot now even when there isn't a GPU installed some of that space is occupied by the cpu's cooling fans but they've already released a reference dual SSD design as an example I'm just excited to have a place to put my Mountain do without sacrificing IO coming from an Intel based MacBook Pro with a grand total of four USB type-c ports this was
the biggest breath of fresh air across my entire experience sure Apple just including dcent iio would fix most of that but if your needs change or you want to do something silly like running four displays off your laptop you don't need a dongle at least not an external one now speaking of external the power brick is this cute little 180 watt Gallum nitride unit and it's the highest wat type-c charger I've ever heard of and a far cry at least in terms of size for most gaming laptop power good job
their framework also from their first laptop dis assembly experience since all of the In fairness to other laptop manufacturers the framework is big but it's not super powerful like that GPU is not a mobile 4090 or mobile 4080 or whatever else so just you know something to consider the screws are accessible from the top of the laptop so replacing any part of this laptop is an absolute Joy now if you're not an experienced framework has guides for replacing literally every part of the laptop
that's because if you're a nerd you can buy this laptop IKEA style and put it together yourself and I take assembling a framework laptop over doing Ike any day of the week if you miss our framework factory tour a little tidbit is that they actually preassemble the DIY Edition laptops for QC and stress testing and then they get taken apart before shiing you can build it yourself don't believe it's that easy well it took about this long to get the entire laptop to Pieces we've got the 85w
battery 56 module 7 minutes that's really fast that's really impressive it's like wicked fast oh hey speaking of uh framework laptop TOS being wicked fast uh someone I saw someone in chat earlier asking about the electroboom collab when's it coming yeah because that includes a framework Build Challenge oh where every additional minute I take to assemble it he turns up the value on the dog collar the dog shock collar that's attached to my neck and then once I'm done he gets
to press it oh wow so I I had to try to speed build one anyway how fast did you do it well I'm not going to spoil video the point is that video is coming out uh hopefully Monday exciting stay tuned very cool 7700 s inside the GPU module a ryzen 78 or 7940 HS powered main board two ddr5 sodium slots two gen 4 m.2 slots and if you're not happy with the configurations you can see on screen here the DIY Edition can be ordered in pretty much any config you want or Bare Bones and
you can call your own storage ramp which made picking laptops to Benchmark against uh a little tricky to see what you can get in a similarly priced and classed bigname laptop we opted for an Intel Nvidia spec Lenova Legion Slim 7i that was a much faster GPU I am not excited to see how much faster that ising laptops to Benchmark again a little tricky to see what you can get in a similarly priced and classed bigname laptop we opted for an Intel that's a lot of ram y that's a big
battery y that's a really fast CPU although I think the framework will probably hold its own when it comes to CPU but that is that is a big GPU Nvidia spe Lenovo Legion slim 7i and to make sure our framework is performing as it should and as tough a16 it's cheaper and it was supposed to be the same specs as the framework 16 that was until they shipped the lower-end model for the Press unit the differences between the CPUs are minor so it should still tell us that the framework is
performing up to enough despite those differences every game is actually a pretty tight race cyber Punk nearly maxed out at 1080p yeah I want to see thank you okay uh that is not nearly as far off the lovo legion yeah as I thought it might be like if you're talking a difference in one FPS on 1% lows all right no one's going to notice that yeah it's pretty good the Intel base Lenova is slightly ahead in average FPS with both itself and the AMD based Asus model feeding the framework by one
frame in 1% lows in f123 Intel's okay this is less good yeah um so now we're at closer to a 10% uplift on the Lenovo yeah widens a bit wait wait wa wait I thought the framework was still at the bottom no no no middle oh tremendous okay Carry On a modest showing in second place surprisingly beating out the on paper faster to No One surprise in Total War Warhammer 3 the 470 wins again but our yeah this is this that's a decent jump this is way closer than I thought this whole thing was going to
be okay framework squeaks past the Asus again it's hard to say what exactly is giving it the advantage in these games but the faster memory and better cooling on the framework likely has something to do with it as for productivity the framework 16 loses handily incin both single and multicore but no surprises there as the Asus has a more thermal head room when it doesn't have at the same time in blender our as laptop crushes the framework across the board despite the only real difference being a  
video I me compared to the Lenovo yeah the Gap is large but compared to the Lenovo it's very close hand and in media editing with Premier in Photoshop overall not a lot of surprises here the faster CPU in the Asus shines in productivity but we expect the higher end framework would yield the same result as for yeah it's not a great price performance option but it's not terrible either it's just that if you want the most frames for your money this isn't the laptop to buy also you should probably just buy a
desktop but if you do buy one protect it with a skin brand sponsor this of the video so L could show you how being a relatively new company parties are making accessories neand sure is and they're going to be ready for launch day they said two anever one would be easier for case to fight a rip off oh they're both the same my notes say look how accurate these internals are no wonder they got so pissed they got ripped off but I actually haven't had this thing open yet so maybe
probably while I completely ignore D Brand's explicit instructions for how to do this and make up my own method always check their site and make sure that you do it the right way what am I supposed to be saying though I know they're paying me to put a skin on a laptop right now but this is my favorite kind of integration we're all working together to promote something we believe in yeah yeah that's both an investor and jav hey thanks debr shout out so I think I've got it pretty decently lined up
right now there's no way this battery is made in Canada that's got to be any steg framework's Canadian they are Canadian Bros that's a framework d not Canadian oh it's not quite straight wow oh I bued it to sub bued it right there just don't look right where don't worry about it don't right where where it's not bad pretty flat yeah yeah oh hey 5' one line oh I know when I'm insulted check out dbrand at over to you John great in our battery urance test both with and without the GPU hey it's
John from the love yeah okay oh whoa whoa whoa that's really good yeah whoa how did it do so how' it do so well here wow well that's good that's crazy actually okay beating Asus and Lenovo by a few hours stress test hey okay we're doing good yeah I mean to be clear like those bars look a lot higher you know but like that's another uh 15 minutes on battery if you're running an intense game yeah so don't you know don't don't read too much it and if you the GPU you'll get even more
battery life however none of these laptops are industry leading for battery life but if the battery in the framework starts to struggle after a few years at least you can easily replace it was this a cold day no I don't think so two to three hosts are wearing Tes well okay uh there was some internal drama uh about a week and a half ago two week about two weeks ago somebody adjusted the thermostat and Tech dad was not impressed that's me our thermostat in the warehouse over here it's great in
the winter because it uses um air conditioning okay in the summer because we have an air conditioner and not a heat pump here uh we use a radiant tube uh so gas radiant heating but because of the buildout that we did in the building the original radiant tubes of which there were a total of four in these four units well three of them are gone now oh because they don't fit anymore because they were longer than we have left in the building after we built Meine over that part and like I don't know even if
you could leave it there above the mezine you wouldn't because it'd be a fire hazard because you have something right next to a radi heating tube yeah so we only have one we only have one radiant heating tube in this warehouse and it's at the very end now we have a fan there's a fan that we spent like it's from it's from Big "Ass Fans so it costs like ,000 to buy" this fan and install it but the Shooters never turn it on because it's kind of loud and it's inconvenient to turn it on
and off which I get I hear you but someone not knowing all of this so what you're supposed to do is turn on the radiant tube and put on the fan so that it's not just boiling on one side and then cold on the other yeah um so what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to turn on the fan um and not adjust the thermostat so someone was like I'm cold over here and adjusted the thermostat so the warehouse was freaking like a freaking sauna while while we were going through that cold snap it's like it was
also cooking on the weekends guys did you figure that one out uh I don't know we'll figure that out later but the point was like guys don't don't don't touch the thermostat look I know it's not a perfect system darn it but just turn on the fan just put put on the the circulation fan um I think when you hit like late 20s early 30s you just start caring about thermostats a lot yeah it's just a thing so Logistics um locked they put a lock on the thermostat they took the key and
they took it over to the other building because nobody is ever supposed to adjust it and it's possible that maybe they overcorrected and things were cold for a bit but I think they've got it dialed in now got it okay all right so now now you all know The Saga of the uh the thermostat adjustment was it chil that day it's like working behind the scenes maybe yeah as for cooling they partnered with Cooler Master design is gigantic heat pipe array which paired with the liquid
metal resulted in combuster atts that absolutely crushed the oh whoa okay so whatever complaints other media were seeing the thermal solution maybe that was an issue with their unit then if you're having a hard time reading this the red line is framework blue line is Asus yellow line is Lenovo so they yeah a crushed I think is a pretty good word for that that's awesome that's very good that's a great result I will yet again you already said it I will yet again say it sounds like
most if not all of the review units were pre-production maybe not wise yeah continuing on a16 from Asus which is running the exact same RX 7700s the framework did Peak higher than the lenovo's RTX 470 but once the fans ramped up it held its own it's important to mention that the Lenovo unit wasac with noct nth1 in a previous project so it could be possible that the framework would look even better here to a factory Lenovo remember the F1 test that framework performs exceptionally well
staying under while the and the Lenovo are both hitting over 70 or even 80° and that's while maintaining a very solid lovo I think he's talking Peaks there yeah but what happened here these both Spike right here and this one spikes Down The f123 Benchmark is not uh canned fully canned it it runs um it's it's it's Dynamic I okay sorry what's the best way for me to descri it's not exactly the same every time yeah like all the AI is running all the physics is running yeah so sometimes you can just
have something slightly different is going to happen something happens slightly different you should just be kind of looking at overall how it goes are both hitting over 70 or even 80° and that's while maintaining a very solid 4.1 gz on the average clock speed A6 average closer to 2.7 yikes to be fair we ran all these laptops in their default power configurations but the tough a6s radon 7700s is reporting 80° average on the core and 93 on The Hot Spot the framework kept to much more
reasonable 68 and 80° respectively the webcam and microphone which use the same module as the framework 13 very cool look and sound like this at least with a I was going to say that was a big audio quality change yeah I know we got this we got this bro big Studio light in front of me and if you shut it off like this in a pretty DM crappy environment not great not terrible and I did anecdotally hear that the microphone sounded better than my airpods Pro too so cool and they do at least have
physical shut off switches which is a nice touch and we haven't even talked about the display the framework 16 holds its own when it comes to color accuracy reaching an average SDR Delta of 1.5 and of 2.8 part thanks to Windows Auto color management system which only seems to support a few selected displays it shifts with it turned off making the numbers much worse so we recommend using it the display is bright enough for outdoors over 500 nits motion Clarity is decent enough at 165 HZ which is great
for gaming but there are a couple of issues that are a bit hard to ignore like the honestly kind of mid uniformity that results in visible vignetting on web pages and solid backgrounds and somehow our units panel was pained under the removable plastic bezel for some reason it kind of looks like you can seen that happen in a decent amount this leads me to the price as configured ignoring extra accessories like the expansion shell which is included if you spe a GPU and cost $100 on its own this
"is a $2,200 laptop they're not gouging" remember it's a small company building an entirely bespoke laptop that genuinely could and seems to already be changing an entire industry yeah and they have to pay their graphic designers to draw those little portraits of everybody yeah that's not free yeah yeah the keyboard stability and display uniformity are things that would normally be a deal breaker for me especially at this price point and I wouldn't blame you for feeling they should have an on-site dog
sitter okay that's an insight side joke people are not going to get but here's the thing fixing the keyboard is probably something you can DIY as Al showed earlier and assuming framework either fixes the issues or comes up with a panel upgrade down the road I can probably live with that display for a while for the utter flexibility repairability and the simple fact that this could be theoretically the last gaming laptop I'd ever need to buy that's pretty freaking cool so as long
as framework stays in business and follows through with their promises I mean they already have a history of doing so when the CPU is too outdated or the GP isn't strong enough that's actually a really good point if these guys came out of nowhere and went straight at we're doing a gaming laptop that would have been the wrong move I wouldn't I wouldn't believe them there's absolutely no way the only thing that gives this any credibility is the fact that they've already oh I was 
sorry hold on is the fact that they've already delivered multiple generations of upgrades on the framework 13 so as far as I'm concerned I believe them until they screw it up now as opposed to my default state would have been not believing them until they actually do something before yeah precedent is good right noward gets gunked up and the battery dies it's an easy swap instead of chucking away an entire machine you could have your very own laptop of thesias and I can't wait
to see what the future holds all that's left is to decide if I want to keep my pre-order but think of the modules Jake right and maybe they could make a module that would help me segue to our sponsor Jaa we've all been there trying to sell stuff the usual way I've T I've taught them well yeah was pretty good that was a good video that was really good it's almost like we have a style and we have a really good team and stuff um yeah that was that was that was an awesome video I really liked switching between
the different hosts kind of getting the different perspectives great job everyone like great job yeah that was really good really enjoyed that yeah first camera appearance as well super good oh yeah John did great that was great yep I think it's a I think it was the right call to just keep it for a short period because I think that while he did a great job it can be hard to do like I wasn't there when they were shooting it but it can be hard to do like long takes which can make it a
lot more work for the editor and stuff um and it's it's nice to ease people into it you know get people kind of used to them as well I also really personally you did a good job as a personal opinion flavor thing I like expert in a thing presenting their section of a thing I've always really like whether they're the best presenter or not you can get away with almost any level of host yeah as long as they're not on camera for too long yeah so that's something that we've
used a lot when we've done factory tours for example y like when I did the Intel tours I recognized pretty quickly that these were not folks that I could give like a 200w Spiel to um but I can do a little thing but if I gave them exactly the intonation I wanted gave them the eyeline and gave them like like 10 words or something like that then I could get them in the video they could do a great job they could put their best foot forward and then people could hear it right from the experts and we get that
that balance where I do my thing which is to be a host and they get to do their thing which is to be an expert and it enhances the video by by putting those elements together right and I think that the team did a great job of doing that um really good really good video there's an official post from framework on framework's Community page oh can I go your laptop sure it's really long oh wow um but they address a bunch of stuff high frequency noise from the main board uh buzzing noise from Graphics
module CPU thermal module performance uh liquid metal barrier adjustments cold GPU performance uh DPC watchdog violation blue screen speecher attenuated on the left or right channel touchpad module sliding friction display alignment display color gam minor fix and finish modules keyboard detection secondary SSD may disappear display Frozen after uh smart mck switching and they're yeah so maybe if you're interested go read that so what you're  bonnet like very very good Circle fantastic
thank you there's a channel super fun how to draw a circle I watched it now I know very popular was it that's a short yeah has like 100 million views or something wow most our most successful video ever and it's just like can anyone at the company do a backflip yes we should do how to do a backflip no we shouldn't why because you know who it is  Elijah what we should definitely do it now we really shouldn't Elijah there you go there you go revive Channel super fun by yourself
one short video how to do a backflip no other content no Mainline videos not even once none of that kind of stuff yeah how to draw a perfect circle 107  ridiculous if he screws up doing a backflip on work on work property and hits his head again what happens we are liable that's why he will never do a back flip on work property Elijah if you're watching no what if you go to a a trampoline place like a a a gymnastics place with a foam pit and he back flips into a foam pit is he working yeah no
okay forbidden all right can anyone else do a backflip doesn't matter can you do a backflip on a trampoline yeah okay in fact I think there's a uh I think Ivon uploaded a video video of me attempting one at some point on Twitter oh and I uh it seemed like something you might be able to do I I like you know how our trampoline has the the net around it I like hit the net cuz I like I almost back flipped like right out of the trampoline cuz it's it had been a long time and I jumped back instead of
jumping up um anyway oh boy um no okay what else are we talking about oh uh merch meag yeah guys the way to interact with the show Good gravy we are an hour and a half in we haven't even done merch messages yet Luke how could you allow this to happen uh it was my plan all along actually like my I came in today and I was like you know what we need to get 90 minutes into the show before we do merch I wanted to get home at a reasonable time today way to go no not going to happen the way to interact
with the show is merch messages don't send a Super Chat don't send twitch bit send a merch message all you got to do is go on LTT store.com find some awesome stuff to check out uh um first warning there will be at least several more but screwdriver bit prices are going to be going up Taran came in and he knows how to do proper math for your operational expenses and we are losing money on screwdriver bids oh basically that's not good once you account for all the handling and everything and overhead um
they are they are not profitable at $6.99 for the the big packs of them so I've I heard in school that that's bad yeah no you didn't you never took that class the point is pricing will be going up so if you see bits that you like and they're in stock uh pick them up uh we are going to make sure everyone gets ample warning I told the guys I was like look we don't want these go we don't want to drop it on people no we don't want to drop it on people and we don't want to go any higher than we have to to
make sure that we're above water on this thing uh they're really high quality bits but guys we we don't want people to feel like uh you know we're trying to adopt the printer model you know um that that's not the intent here but um so so there's going to be a newsletter we're going to we're going to talk about it I think it's probably not going to happen for a couple of months uh but yeah pick up some pick up some bits if you want as a as a merch message oh what now what wait for it what now wait for
it what is it oh this okay  close we're happy that Net's there so I didn't tuck we're also happy you didn't go higher yeah your your feet are like right at the rim of that net oh I know yep I caught that on the security camera people are saying scroll down but I'm not signed in on Twitter so there's nothing there nice there's nothing to scroll down to um yeah so what was I talking about oh I see right bits are going up so all you got to do is add something to your cart
and you'll see a little box for a merch message it'll go to our producer Dan hey there he is Dan really you're going to be in your underwear for the W show I'm at home that's fair uh so it'll go to producer Dan he'll forward it to someone who can answer your question he'll answer it himself or he will send it to me and Luke to reply to uh the main High light items for the store this week are the Steve turtleneck which we launched last week oh there's some interesting stuff okay we'll talk about
that later what was that don't don't worry about it don't worry about it don't worry about don't look at that don't look at that don't look at that uh so the Steve turtleneck this just launched last week this has been extremely popular it's got the seam up the- middle just like the classic one that some guy who's known in the tech space used to wear it's a mock neck so it's not a super high turtleneck it's very wear it's somewhere in between you know business and just you can wear it 
want uh anyway we just launched that and then we also have a brand newly launched item the women's PJ set which our delightful staff helped us model thank you so much everyone for helping out one of those um they have they have too much fun these shoots to be clear it's it's a good thing it's a it's a good thing um wow look at that we even went and used the sets this time okay that doesn't always happen cool good job everyone um and then of course there is something uh the word wrapping on that spin into
Precision ceramic bearing internal bit storage super high quality construction that's right the LT Precision screwdriver is coming all you got to do is put your email here and you will get a notification when it arrives all right merch messages Dan hit me sure let's see Hello w. dll I started my it career in the mid90s with mainly PC Building I really enjoy build streams with lonus in the janky cooling adventures with Alex and lonus something coming  um oh we saw that post on Reddit where
someone's trying to passively cool a high-end GPU um we definitely think we have some ideas to contribute to that concept so we're keeping an eye on it and we are uh potentially going to make our own run at it uh that's that's one idea that we had we let me try to think if there's anything else I mean we just  okay we're probably going to do whole editing Dan water cooling at some point but I can't promise that's going to happen to anytime immediately this how mad are you Dan how mad how mad tell
them am am I gonna get to help go in well I don't see why not then I'm not mad oh I see how it is then we're good all right okay okay but I have something mad about that why would you were giving me a talking to the other day about how we shouldn't water cool the the editing machines with whole room water cooling or wait were you on my side we were talking at Sean and Shawn didn't want to do it I think someone didn't want to do I want to have I don't want to have water blocks on the gpus anymore yeah
are we just doing CPU no how would we just do CPUs okay but we can quick disconnect all the gpus I think we could yeah yeah yeah how about that quick disconnects then it makes it super easy and especially if the quick disconnects just go to the back of the case like it's not a problem at all I issue with it Jon CHT yeah it's gonna be awesome it just feels ridiculous to have the air conditioning running in the winter for the editing D yeah no I I I'm I'm I was trying to defend it I don't remember who
was against someone was against it in that room I don't remember who it was apparently quiet until you said quick disconnects on gpus right quiet how the hell am I quiet well I don't know you're the producer they asking me for I'm just the talent I'm just the face I do seem I do seem quiet quiet hey fix hey main nightmare what's the benefit why didn't you just take a nice mic home that sounds no offense um not great well he didn't he wasn't in he would have had to come in oh to
get the mic to bring it home oh okay all right well remember that I'm also on a call oh yeah I'm not you're not hearing my actual mic yeah I don't know it's what right because why would you use your actual mic for a call it's just a call it's not like it's a podcast that you know thousands of people are watching it's not like important or anything AJ's commenting on the is so triggered right now look at him go I'm not triggered I'm not triggered oh man this isn't a condenser pencil
no it's okay we can fix it with some go xlrs okay um AJ's commenting on the maintenance nightmare but AJ just think about it this way it's just it's just rampant ongoing job security yeah how would we ever how would we ever get to the infra team as long as we keep implementing these like awful infra ideas I think it's there's got to there's got to be some amount of rule of cool and it's pretty cool and it's a bunch of content yeah and ultimately we make content yeah if you guys don't like
them then you can just rip them out after the video's over yeah I don't think we should but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what were we talking about even work merch messages the store something AJ sold let's go oh yeah merch messages um was there another one I thought we did two or three oh hold on hold on the geek of all things asks will the Precision driver storage need proprietary length bits that's honestly the biggest reason I didn't buy your other screwdrivers all I will say right now is
people are going to like our bits you're going to love our bits you're going to love our bits watch this you're going to  bits are are they are are standard SC are those proprietary length or are they just short you know you can get them other places you can can hack off a standard length one and it's exactly the same shank uh or you can put a longer bit in the screwdriver no you can't store it in the handle you can no you can store it in the handle oh you have to align the
things you can only fit six instead of 12 yeah yeah it's not proprietary it's not proprietary but it is less common um the engineering team point out that you can actually get those bits more easily if you know what you're looking for um there's little like ratcheting um like non-s screwdrivers like like like ratcheting I don't know what are they like a socket socket wrench wrench okay yeah yeah but not for but not a wrench ones that have a little um socket for a screwdriver bit oh so ratcheting
screwdrivers but like right angle okay ratcheting screwdrivers and they often use low profile bits so if you get bits for those they will fit in our screwdriver as well they are not proprietary they are just optimized for our screwdriver and they are unusual okay okay now I want to I want to play a little game tan saying I think we were saying I think we were more saying uh the short bits make bit wrenches super nice oh okay well I know for a fact I found them for sale elsewhere as well yeah like I I don't
I'm pretty sure they're not proprietary basically our short bits are cool yeah okay so this what's that is a prototype of the Precision what's that oh this is a prototype of our bit holder because obviously we're not just going to have a screwdriver don't worry about it uh although although although okay that's pretty cool nice oh casual casual magnetic is it is it mechanism for the parts tray is there magnets in the parts tray uh not now but yes nice yeah nice any who any who any who
um short bits are not moronic people who think there are moronic just don't understand it improves the magnetism and it's not just a phas dad and uh makes it fit more things and it's really useful for those other things got them anyway um while we're doing the next one I'm going to play a little game where I'm going to spin this see if it stops before we're done and we're gonna see if it stops before we're done because that ceramic bearing in the top is freaking awesome okay you barely touched it and
it's still going I was gonna offer as well got another one here too okay hold on hold on hold on hold on I'm gonna give it a really good spin you got oh sorry this is a hybrid bearing hybrid hybrid ceramic bearing thanks tinan uh Tan's got my back okay I mean there's ceramic in it so I wasn't wrong about that the ceramic one was too loud I remember now okay okay okay ready Dan uhhuh go hi dll other than it has to get done do you have advice on how to keep your workflow or focus on tasks that you
don't find as much passion in also Luke change your mind uh change my mind tarov is a Rog likee well for me the big one is that I oh man I'm very distractable a lot of the time I really do just end up doing it in little chunks um yeah I think I think one way to do it is to reward yourself for the completion or I do it really late at night yes when I can be super I can focus way better late at night I I like turn on at probably around 9:00 p.m. yeah and it doesn't really like turn off until like
3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. and I can be laser focused and get stuff done gamer timing also yeah it's close to it uh except that you can re-extract which I think is maybe the issue where it fails but there  it's still going it's still going and it's wow yeah wow she's a goer that's wild anyway um we we we we know we know who our  you  Dan uh prototype because I was using them for a while no no we we' is 3D printed one oh okay yeah we've issued them to people to get feedback though
this is very close to done do you have one of the hybrid ceramic bearing ones yes yeah um and I've expressed my complaints about that yeah new ones are even better I had one I had one of the first bearing prototypes with the ceramic oh they're still amazing still amazing they're too loud though you mean the the just trying to make sure you didn't steal it I'll go get it no we we've issued you're you're good don't trust me at all do you I feel like remote Dan is like like dark side Dan or
something I'm like I'm scared of remote Dan's power got a lot of power I don't even have to I don't even have to be near you  Theo don't ruin the W show um any who so Sebastian has built quite a lot of these in various configurations to get feedback from people and make sure that everything's good one of the really cool things that the team did is rather than using um a retaining pin like the uh the mechanism for the bit storage does in the full size driver it's magnetic in
this one so in theory it should have even better longevity cool and it's it also just  you yeah this is uh a lot of people have been like oh the relationship with iFix it ended best friend now you know whoever what but not at all we are not going head tohe head with iix it our driver is going to be at a very different price point for one thing this is not free uh the development wasn't free we think it's a really great driver I think people are really going to love it but I fix it is probably going to be
more affordable for the foreseeable future and I fix it has a wide range of products that we couldn't even if we wanted to couldn't replicate like we are not going to get into adhesive strips for putting the screen back onto your iMac that's not happening we're not going to create guides we're not going to have this comprehensive we're not going to partner with valve for steam deck replacement parts so the way that we see it and the way we've as we've discussed with iFixit is
this relationship continues we both have very similar values we both have a very similar Mission we want things to be more repairable we want things to be more upgradeable we don't want things in landfills and so what we have a screwdriver so what we're not going to like partner anymore that would feel kind of ridiculous did we want to develop a screwdriver I mean yeah we did but no we're not going to we're not going to terminate our relationship if I fix it over that that would be silly
yeah what wouldn't be silly is picking the next topic oh yeah sure I think is that right are we doing that Dan I think so it just says when after dark on the  do okay Luke do you want to pick a topic I will try to do so uh teenager criminally charged for Snapchat joke British citizen uh aditia Verma I hope I'm saying that right sure probably didn't uh is currently being tried in Spain for causing public disorder over a 2022 airport security incident he was boarding a plane to the Spanish island
of Minorca uh 18-year-old Verma jokingly messaged the friends he was traveling with over Snapchat quote uh quote on my way to blow up the plane and then in Brackets I'm a member of the Taliban which I have now said uh into a microphone on the internet uh look I'm not saying Hitler was right oh my God man I don't even have to be in the same room and and you guys just ruin   probably oh gez according according to court testimony it's it's assumed that the message was picked up via gatwick's
Wi-Fi network no Verma says that was oh interesting Verma says that he was not using gatwick's Wi-Fi but it's unclear whether or not the messages recipients were UK Security Services then alerted Spanish authorities who scrambled Two fighter jets no way to es what is a fighter jet going to do if someone is on board a plane threatening to blow it up you blow up that plane I'll shoot it with a missile we'll blow it up before you can blow it up you can't quit you're fire pun intended
that is an interesting one that was there's like let me get that for you oh thank you oh thank you there's more on the keyword yeah nice perfect um uh wow okay um yeah the Two fighter jets were were scrambled to escort the plane until it landed Verma was arrested in Spain and later questioned by British intelligence wow note there are frequent claims on the internet that Snapchat encrypts pictures and videos but not plain text messages however Snapchat's own website makes no such claim and only
says that the messages sent via its service are private private well I mean there's plenty of messages sent on Snapchat that are of privates I come on I get nothing for that yeah nothing what I spit on your computer one time too busy I I spit on your computer one time I get nothing was pretty  myself he's going to ding he's going to ding he's going to ding there it is very nice without Dan's mic are they able to hear that very well I don't know doesn't matter it's the principle of the thing
yeah yeah fair enough um It came it came through fine nice perfect Jessica said it seems likely that if it were endtoend encrypted uh that they would say so which I completely agree with um if found guilty Verma could be fined around "$224,000 and made to pay over a 100" grand for the Spanish military's extremely useful in this case to fighter jets uh yeah wow very interesting discussion question is scanning messages sent over on public Wi-Fi a reasonable security precaution is the average
person using public Wi-Fi or SnapChat aware that this is even a possibility is this a proportionate response on the part of Spanish authorities so here's the thing no Buddy's 18 I probably would have made an edgy joke as I'm driving to the Border about you know smuggling something when I was 18 I know better now I've heard I don't know if this is actually true but I've heard there are microphones they so they can listen to you in your car while you wait to cross the border I don't know if
it's true me neither but I always say nice things but I just I just keep don't say anything I just keep my damn mouth shut yeah any time i'm anywhere near an airport anywhere near a border anywhere near a customs officer it's  like I don't know man like do we really want to crush his life for a joke but then like an 18-year-old can definitely you know commit a crime yep so dude I don't know I um wonder what the age distribution for crimes are I don't know Financial ones way over
here other more different ones probably less there that's interesting too type of crime a age distribution yeah like like what's the average murderer age yeah you know what's the average uh you know being any age I suspect it's actually probably younger fairly specific probably skew younger for like breaking enter break entering physical crimes probably skew younger Financial crimes you be like senior citizen like trying to you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah old fist of cuffs yeah um difference between
smuggling and terrorist threats yeah sure but it like they're going to flag it one way or the other the response will just be different and the question our discussion question was should they be monitoring that I mean what I would want to say is they should have had a proportional response based on that he clearly wasn't organized enough to be you know not using public Wi-Fi or not using freaking Snapchat for the communication but the flip side of that is like have you ever
looked up dumb criminal montages like that's how they catch criminals is that criminals are dumb as so yeah uh it's pretty obviously a joke to me but it's not going to be obviously a joke to everyone um but I mean finding him "$124,000 when he's" 18 um like he's going to have to declare bankruptcy that's that's lifechanging stuff right there can you declare bankruptcy on a government fine like that I don't know I don't know how bankruptcy works I've never been bankrupt yeah me
too I know you can't for student loans cuz you hear that that on the internets oh yeah yeah yeah no that's that's like a thing I think that's a thing at least in the states can you can can you for this isn't in the States but can you do that for defamation settlements I have no idea yeah I don't know I don't   ag1 there it is have you been neglecting your daily nutritional intake ag1 is a convenient supplemental drink to help fill in some of those nutritional blind spots one scoop has 75 different

and threw it away but I'm wondering how a scam like this would be cost effective was it a bad one did you did you run it through a tester there are testers to find out if they're malicious cables um but I would not imagine a scam like that that to be particularly cost effective depending on it depends if they're targeted like if if this person's mom works in um like a medical field or something like that and they they were trying to Target them for for patient data or something then
absolutely it would be cost effective but yeah I I know certain uh medical procedures she performs wow no I'm I'm just I'm just wow wow [Laughter] uh yeah I I can't imagine just randomly shipping out a th000 USB cables it depends though be valuable if they're the ones that are uh that that you can that you know have Wi-Fi and stuff built into them like if it's an OMG cable or something like that is definitely not cost effective those are quite expensive but if all it has in it is a tiny amount
of storage and it just farts a little payload onto your computer yeah I still think it would probably need to be targeted though cuz like you're still paying shipping all this other kind of stuff and what what do you shipping is cheap in the UK though and like there's a lot of places actually that shipping is superada Canadian shipping Canadian shipping is BR send a cable to someone it's like $15 be down the road yeah uh yeah oh Cohen lemon says uh you would Target a neighborhood where it's it's just
generally wealthier people so you just send them to like a wealthy zip code you totally do that with with shipping too so yeah I mean it could it could be like I would call that I'm just making this up on the spot but I would call that like soft targeting when database Arthur you don't know the half of it Royal Mail is super cheap compared to what we have to pay I mean it makes sense you guys are like little tiny Eeny weeny know that you don't own the whole world how it 
him yeah their their ruler is still on our money so yeah why do we have to have stupid Charles on the money so stupid I didn't even mind it when it was Elizabeth she seemed generally not the stupidest at least it didn't like her her whole thing with the the car was very funny I'm going to screw up that story if I try to sell it so I'm just not um but yeah and at least it didn't like change like we we had to incur I'm assuming a relatively significant expense to like reprint a bunch of money
well no they don't reprint it they just print what they like okay print so just change design and continue forward yeah that's not too bad but like eventually they do recall old series and and issue new series yeah that's generally for security more than it is for just like yeah yeah it's it's a different old person on the thing I thought they issued a redesign I I didn't really follow it though yeah I mean was still design time there's still it's still a pain but anyway yeah why not put more loons
or geese on the money yeah I mean I'd be I'd be I'd be down why don't we put freaking Terry Fox on the money yeah like well for what for like limited series or something no just put him on there I didn't think it was oh is he I don't know I I never carry cash anymore money I thought he was on $5 bill or something like we have Canadian heroes in 2020 a short list of eight Bank notable Canadians uh were to be portrayed on the $5 vertical polymer bills in place of Lauer uh five 600
nominees Terry Fox so yeah I guess it was limited I didn't realize it was limited well that's stupid it should just be it should just be Terry Fox forever yeah like for for real for real guys uh if you don't know who Terry Fox is he's an absolute unit you should go read about him it's one of the most inspiring stories that you will ever here he's incredible what a Chad yeah absolute unit all right apparently for a limited time he was also on our Looney well it should just be all the
time yeah yeah yeah yeah okay you heard it here first yeah we're advocating for Terry Fox on all the money instead of King Charles yeah like how many how many greater thans would we need and the Tim those two things should happen Okay I don't know that I would want the Canadian government running it but how about some Canadians yeah how about that fair enough okay we can agree on that  good how many marathons is Charles run fewer than Terry probably and Terry didn't finish one
what was at the end of the marathon what was the goal for for Charles I'm I'm not finished to be clear he finished a lot of marathon distances but I mean the one the marathon and you guys will have to read about him if you want to learn about Terry okay yeah okay yeah remember having Terry Fox day and sports events at school yeah it was great I love that they did that they still do great yeah Terry Fox day is totally still thing that's very good we should have Terry Fox day forever
yeah until we get a better Canadian than Terry Fox we should have Terry Fox day yeah good luck so we'll have Terry Fox  yeah I feel like that's a thing that would actually get Canadians like really riled up if people tried to like go in on Terry Fox oh that would be guns out time yeah unacceptable I'm talking these but you know yeah no unacceptable yeah yeah man don't go after Terry Fox yeah man I'd be really angry D me too I would actually I can see his face you went there for a second no man oh boy oh you
don't oh man yeah you know you don't leave Terry alone yeah oh man all right all right next one sure hey lldd I've just finished my first week at my first job at 19 and I love it though I struggle to keep my personal life from affecting my work and  advice that's tough man like um I don't think it's possible like I think I speak for both of us when I say there have been times when our personal lives have affected work oh yeah and affected like our work with each other yeah in a negative way
to be clear like and probably vice versa but yes in a negative way for sure yeah yeah well okay okay here's an example I've had a pretty 5 months or so I think it's probably affected how short I've been sometimes   but oh man oh man okay sorry don't make   all right sorry that was a serious moment anyway the point is do your best right um other people don't deserve to deal with your baggage and if you have the right mindset about it the relationships you build at work and the
things you do at work can be an oasis um there there have been times in my life when I'd rather be working there have been times where I I didn't want to go home cuz by working I was very focused yep so uh I'm not saying that that's healthy I'm just saying that you should you should try try to make the most of of it uh wow I don't know how to say your name but someone someone in Philip chat said 19 is too young to be mature enough to keep mentally separate he will get there that's another thing that
honestly I would back up a little bit it I find it gets a little easier to to kind of split things when you need to and to emotionally moderate as you get older I have found that personally I don't know how I mean hormonally it makes sense cuz you just kind of get a little they start decreasing yeah you get you get just a little more um a little less Juiced yeah pretty literally  um yeah I don't know it's tough though there's going to be times where you're not going to be able to completely do it
step one is recognizing that it's a potential problem though yes that can help a lot being cognizant of it is huge analyze in a in a situation and and try to figure out like okay I'm not going to be able to handle this properly do I need to remove myself from this scenario and it helps not take things personally like if someone's like you know yo you know the this work isn't up to your usual standard uh we need an improvement you know like let's let's say you end up in a coaching session or
something because it's been go it was ongoing for a while and it's like really affecting the quality of the work hypothetically right so if you can basically go hey hey I am not being attacked this is I am capable of more and I need to and I need to refocus if I if I want to perform at the way that you know I want to perform which will be good for my career um I'm being compensated for ET ET all of this right you know assumes that everyone's acting in good faith right like you might just
have like a shy boss or something like that and they're just beating you up or or whatever right like I yeah I'm assuming a best case scenario where where you're you're in a job that you know has in you're in a healthy workplace environment at a at a healthy company where where feedback is given in a in a respectful professional manner but um there's definitely ways that you can utilize being aware of it to to help to to modulate yourself moderate yourself both I guess yeah it
worked but yeah I mean you're going to go through some stuff um I think as people start getting into their 20s and 30s like grandparents start to kind of pass away at a fairly High rate Den is  sorry thank you Dan Vale every Everybody Take the posture check um but yeah you start kind of going through some stuff um relatives passing away um yeah relationship is a big one it's like relationship maybe maybe you'll break up with your significant other y or maybe your significant other going through
something and that'll be worse yes to be completely honest yep seen that before and and what if your significant others going through something really really hard and the support of that person is very draining and you're just gassed out emotionally when you get to work um like there's there's there's just so many different things that can come up that can make emotional regulation difficult and that will affect your  best next one no we don't don't need a shock caller for posture checks Cory G
I've spent enough of my life with a shock CER on man the one Elijah got for that video is flipping crazy like I think medy actually felt bad about shocking me with it and normally he just shocks me because he thinks it's hilarious and he has no remorse [Laughter] whatsoever it's very painful that's rough all right hit me Dan Hi l D scrapyard Wars is what brought me to your channel love to hear it's returning can you share any details about it I love to see the content about
older and budget good enough Hardware uh right now the only thing that I can share is that we are shopping it to sponsors as soon as we have one we're going to lock in some production dates the concept is really good but I don't want to say what it is yet because I would love for it to just be a surprise I don't even think I know what it is no you don't oh I think that gives you an unfair Advantage sir uh no it doesn't oh okay yeah it'll be fine sounds good yeah I'm excited if anything this will be the
most Fair one in a very long time oh wait I think I do know what it is oh okay well then sh  okay oh more topics okay let's do topics Luke what do you want to do for a topic uh we've got whoa something's happening to the dock what what's going on is itone just like drawing smiley faces was that you what the the teenager criminally charged for Snapchat joke there's just like random oh no I mashed your keyboard it made a bunch of smiley faces that's amazing um okay oh here hold on
hold on really quick here guys so here's what he's talking about um I had planned to do this this week someone posted on oh go yeah I even brought my Apple TV uh but someone posted on Reddit after I had complained last week about how it was impossible for me to cancel my Apple arcade subscription from my Apple TV uh someone posted saying they didn't appreciate um the the negligence and the way that I ranted about it without actually checking if it was true um I responded on Reddit saying hey um I see
your screenshot that shows you are able to cancel I don't know if this is a regional difference I don't know if it's a change it's definitely something I experienced here's a link to someone else who experience the same thing that also links to Apple's own support documentation that verifies that there is no way to cancel it on Apple arcade or without installing iTunes so I don't know what to tell you they deleted the post we had a good chat about it in the pre-show they're actually a float plane
subscriber so we're all cool everything's cool but I had intended to do a segment where I try it live I'm going to subscribe to Apple arcade again and then I'm going to try to unsubscribe uh but Dan isn't in this week so I guess we're going to do it next week I'm just letting you guys know I haven't forgotten about it and I do want to get to the bottom of that I suspect it's a regional requirement could be some some country requires you to be able to cancel it through whatever something
well now that we know that Apple plans to allow third party marketplaces allow um in the EU only it's very clear that Apple has Regional cap different flows depending on the region and that they can do that yeah or at least they will at that time yeah uh gaming is still bleeding jobs so far in 2024 the gaming industry has lost a total of around 5670 jobs um I know this isn't just gaming industry but if you go to layoffs.fyi which is a pretty cool website um it shows that in 2024 so far 91 tech
companies with layoffs have uh "accumulated 24,5 164 employees laid off" um that isn't just gaming though that's that's like tech industry in general so those those are definitely different things uh more than half of the job losses seen in the gaming industry at least over the C uh told around 5670 jobs more than half the job losses seen over the course of last year yeah so we've already lost over half as many jobs in 2024 as we did in all of 2023 yeah maybe in gaming specifically yeah
not not in Tech because Tech was over "250,000 last year yeah um so I I just" keep inserting Tech even though that's not what the topic is talking about at all which is which is very cool of me um however about confusion and a lack of communication meaning they didn't know whether or not they still have a job Riot games has announced they're laying off around 11% of their Global staff 530 employees while CEO Dylan uh jadea they put in the pronunciation that's sick W shout out Jessica and Riley yeah Juda
claimed uh quote as CEO I'm accountable for the changes we're making and where we're headed heading in the future he likewise described these layoffs as the result of several risky management decisions including the company doubling its headcount over the course of only a few years and taking big bets in 2019 that didn't pay off it is unclear from the memo whether Riot leadership will be undergoing any changes or sustaining any pay cut notably Juda was pres uh president of the company for six years
before becoming CEO in 2023 Riot says they will be offering uh departing staff at least six months of severance pay uh with a top up to cover their health benefits six months of access to job placement services and a laptop for job search purposes if they don't have one holy crap that's really generous that's insanely generous uh laid off staff holding work visas will be given additional support to Aid them with their immigration status that's that's pretty good I mean our discussion
question is is there a right way to handle layoffs I'd say even half of that would have been pretty darn right way very like yeah yeah that's that's a lot half a year salary is wild that's really outstanding I mean that would that would  to apply to a company like Riot knowing that okay I'm either if it doesn't work out if it doesn't work out these are people who when they make a mistake they make a good faith effort to deal with it yeah like yeah sometimes you hire someone and you know what this project
it doesn't make sense anymore um but at least they're they're taking it on the chin they're eating the cost dude 530 employees six Monon salaries yeah that's millions and millions of dollars wow like they are they are putting their money where their mouth is and taking care of taking care of the errors that management made that led to these redundancies I think that's really that's huge wow yep that's that's a big move yeah love to see it you know what I'd love to see a lot less than
that this is great I hope you haven't read this yet during a recent CNBC interview huet Packard CEO Enrique lores oh made a series of what are uh described in our in our notes as inflammatory statements um in other words he was a raging shitthead he said that customers who Buy printers are and this is a quote an investment and that if that customer doesn't buy enough ink and supplies they are a bad investment I would Hazard to believe they're selling their printers at a loss if they were I would maybe
understand the statement I'm not sure I'm convinced of that anymore I seriously doubt they do luras further stated that in the long term HP wants to make printing a subscription that is a direct quote which will reduce the barriers to printing are youing listening to yourself sir could you be more out of touch commercial okay fine let's talk about that for my inkjet ass printer that I use like once every six months no if I want to buy a little syringe needle nonsense thing and inject some
stupid crappy third party ink into my thing because it clogged and I don't feel like getting a brand new one I'm going to I'm going to do that they put they put chips in their ink cartridges now do you know that yeah and and let's talk about that for a second because the next point which I I have great this is great enraged me I want I wanted to do it but you you do it you do it I I took all your topics today you do it l L's likewise alleged that viruses can be embedded in third-party
cartridges and used uh to infect a user's Network through their printer research firm actionable intelligence proved that this kind of attack was theoretically possible in 2022 in response to an HP bug Bounty but HP has acknowledged that there are no known cases uh such as a such as a hack that have occurred um what would be crazy if you stopped making them that way so that this wasn't possible why does the  fault okay discussion question when will the EU come for HP hopefully quickly now
yeah do are there any EU Regulators like can we can we get can can I get in touch cuz I have ideas like I'm I'm down if any if anyone actually like has the ear of anyone who works at any like EU regulatory bodies that deal with this kind of stuff man I'd be happy to chat I want to chat Consul look I'm not saying that government regulation is the answer to everything I'll meet you on your hours it's not but when this is what's happening if this is what the free market says is
okay then we because the the terrible things that we're currently doing might be dangerous for you if you try to circumvent them what we opened up this attack Vector we opened Pandora's Box so now um you know that's not on us that's on you no off man yeah Q Capal KLA 42 says #f framework printer don't imagine for a second I haven't brought it up the issue is that there's a small handful of companies that own basically every printer related intellectual property thing mhm good fraking
luck yeah that makes sense darn  that was that was like I was laughing during the I I did I did read this ahead of time I was laughing during the first paragraph and I was enraged during the  joke gross we need to sell you armor because our car randomly tries to stab you in the chest yeah it's like what make it stop doing that yeah like yeah how about just don't do that anyways what else we got today oh my God we have uh we had so many product announcements that I just like didn't even talk
about um okay did we even talk about this I'm so sorry I know I don't think so I've been wearing it for the show how did we have so many product things today that is this is a lot of stuff we have a short circuit t-shirt it's like the short circuit long sleeve but it's a t-shirt look how cool it is yeah damn that's a cool shirt it's pretty cool yeah yeah and there's but wait there's more we have a white shirt now it's 100% cotton for people who like oh it's just a plain white shirt 100%
cotton sweet and it's it's got a really great hand feel still even though it's not the same material as our typical shirt uh it's a bit heavier uh oh yeah look at that okay heavier whatever this were grams per square meter I I forget what this is I made that up that maybe is what it is but it's a little bit on the heavier side to um to to hide those to be a little less see-through pure white shirts as cool as they are can have some see-through issues so but really similar fit to our
6040 cotton poly's and uh looks great all the way from extra small to Tri XL I think that's what HP does when they sell you printers yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we've all seen the bit yeah yeah yeah yeah um was there anything else CRA I think you did everything else okay did I did I hit everything else I think so yeah okay all right um um yeah I don't know maybe we'll just talk about them again next week or something like that and try try and double dip yeah we'll be like apple we'll just double dip and
then do a and you got to pay a subscription once we send it to you you got to send us our like protection money for your shirt yeah um uh next topic uh yeah why no super review oh Nvidia launched the RTX 470 super last week on the 17th and we'll be launching the 480 super super next week on January 31st there was also a 4070 TI super I think I can't remember which other super there was it doesn't matter the point is we haven't done an LTT review of either of them um because we
didn't feel like dealing with nvidia's six embargos six for this launch for all for each of the three cards and remember Guys these are not new gpus these are a thing that we already had but like slightly reaj jiggered six and they had six embargos is that three per card that is two per card there were three cards oh yeah so there's an unboxing embargo for each card review embargo and then a review embargo oh wait did I say six I meant nine embargos so or maybe it's not nine
because at least one of them has a separate review embargo for the founders Edition and for the aib cards I can't I can't remember but basically I saw the schedule and I said okay number one off Nvidia Just Launch them Just Launch them we'll be happy to review them we'll put them all together number two I just I'm sorry but I just I just think it's ridiculous for our viewers to have to dig through all these different videos you know you want nine videos yeah no but because every one of the
like following videos is just going to be all the graphs you just looked at with one more data point on it so we made the decision when we saw this to do one review video what a Terry move of the new super lineup thank you um it wasn't just my decision we talked about it as a team we just looked at it we went this is absurd maybe you know if we have time we'll do a couple of them on short circuit but no we're going to do our review of super you guys can just watch one
video you'll know everything you need to "know about super the super 4,000 yeah" exactly sounds cooler yeah no just just ridiculous so instead you guys got the you know how we're parallelizing our GPU benchmarking video which is going to be super cool super cool get it uh because and you won't necessarily see it on the super review here but in future we are going to be able to hopefully massively increase the number of fresh results that we can have on our Benchmark charts um because as
you guys know we retest as long as there isn't a new driver what was that did you hear that yeah uh I opened a video on YouTube and I guess it was still piped through cool okay the point is um okay okay we're muted no the the the video yeah okay uh the point is that we are so we're able to provide fresh testing data and we'll be able to provide so much more so as long as there um unless as long as there unless there hasn't been a driver update at all no OS updates no driver
updates we retest and we'll be able to do that with a much much wider pipe with the three CPUs that we have found are within I think it ended up being like 0.25% of each other um in productivity it doesn't matter it's in the video speaking of memorized you should watch that too cuz you're talking about GPU testing but the CPU testing video was sick no no no that's for GPU testing oh it's the same thing yeah no no no no no no no it's not the same thing no I meant you're we're talking about the same
video we were talking about the same video and a lot of people misunderstood that um we are validating CPUs that are the intro explains it pretty well it's just a long video nearly identical to each other so that when we are doing GPU testing we can test three gpus at a time instead of one GPU at a time stand bench has a Delta of what was it 8% or something I don't remember what the percentage was it was as much as 8% and I think that was in factorio or something like that
if it has that much of a Delta then all your results are screwed so you you need similar platforms for standardization and um so so a lot of people seemed really confused by that video like I remember seeing one bit of feedback on it that we should um if we oh man I forget what it was but it was basically like no you should just rerun The Benchmark more times and I'm like no no no we already we already do that this is that that's not what that is not what we're talking
about at all we already do multiple runs and then uh the outliers go away and then the median or me or whatever we have smart people who do that stuff um yeah really cool video that kind of thing doesn't get a lot of views but what it is is it's foundational so when the lab's website is fully launched when we start to populate it with articles this is what we're going to be able to kind of Point people to and go okay yeah this is the rigor that is going on behind the scenes so that when you guys
just see a graph on the lab's website you'll know it's good to go and in a way I'm actually I'm really looking forward to the lab's website because there's going to be so much less possibility for human error like even in that video after all the after all the QC there were like there were I think two bars that were oh CU you can update it mislabeled one of them was 1% and one of them said one it said 1% when it was supposed to be averag and it average when it supposed to be 1% but when
everything's coming straight out of the results database and the graphs are just automatically generated we don't have to worry about human input creating graphical assets that' be nice it's going to be so there could still be issues with anyways whatever nothing is infallible yeah but it'll be nice but it there will be less human Intervention which is and with the site at least even if there are still issues uh we can update it um a lot of people asked and this is a question that's coming up here
why not just force the clock speed do you do that do you run your computer like that no oh it's actually a surprisingly unrealistic thing in current year yep 100% so uh no we we think it's wor the work of making sure that we are running the system the way that you would run the system so that's why we that's why when it was time to get over 10 CPUs we went for a modern top tier chip because we want to see what the maximum difference that we can see in these gpus is assuming that we
can reduce the other system bottlenecks as much as we can and we spent the time testing it to make sure that we have consistency we're going to have to continue to revalidate and with every new platform we're going to have to do this process again but you guys are worth it you guys are worth it these things take time man like I think I think a lot of people are are looking at the slow progress in the lab going like oh yeah you know like why is it so slow you know why why were
there M Engineering takes time and it's just like guys because there's always going to be a little bit of learning as we go and these things take time yeah it's good keep getting better though that I can promise you it's going to keep getting better oh yeah it was a great video it was fun doesn't get a lot of views that kind of thing but is what it is unfortunately that's okay we're just going to do it because we care and at the end of the day if those kinds of videos just don't get views then that's
fine we'll have the website but we still want everything we do to have this Foundation that's what we are building towards that's the  optometrist I still like Chief eyeball officer but anyways uh Disney's Hol deck Disney has unveiled a working model of what they're calling the world's first multi-person omnidirectional modular expandable treadmill floor okay I intentionally have not watched this video yet because it sounds too good to be true yeah and if I was going to be disappointed
I wanted it to happen in front of y'all so this is this is not actually a this week thing I've already seen this this is from last week but it's sick uh okay  yeah are you kidding me no how does it no they also are they just all on bearings like what am I looking at well it's it's always pulling you kind of to the middle-ish how do you stand still multiple people  platform and you can tell even just by how he stands and in an earlier portion of the video you see him walk into the
room and some of uh his natural gate actually makes it look I think like it's not working as well as it is just cuz he's a bit of a shuffler a little bit of a shuffler yeah which makes you think that it's maybe not doing as well but you see him walking on normal floor beforehand you can kind of see that happening um I think it's incredibly impressive uh people say can you run I there's uh Visual Evidence of that but I think they say that you can they have a really really cool moves yeah they
have a really cool demo somewhere in the video yeah that's okay you guys should go watch it are you talking about him sitting on the chair and them rolling him around on it yes what the heck so that's at like 4 minutes and 30 yeah go check out the video they also show not even a person which I think is incredibly interesting I think it's like a a teaser at the end or something I don't remember what it is but they show and you should watch it uh when he's sitting on the chair they're like
whipping it around he's moving very fast which is also interesting um at one point in time they just put an Apple box with no one on it and it just cruises around on it and they make it move this is wild which is incredibly interesting for a huge amount of applications cuz it's directional conveyor belt at that point I just hope Disney doesn't patent it and then oh they're like definitely only use it in their Parks oh they're like definitely going to do that and then they did say
it has applications in other things so I suspect they might try to patent it but I also suspect they might try to like license it out to other people okay um because they talked about how his has applications and a wide variety of things not just their perks yeah so I hope it just doesn't end up so there's like one ride yeah you know you know some Star Wars experience and that's the only place that ever exists ever you get like  yeah guys oh my God I wasn't done the sentence guys I know they're going to  it
um I just don't want it to only exist in one theme park experience and then nowhere else okay our last big topic for the week Twitter pumps Mr Beast video this is kind of hilarious who didn't see this coming Mr Beast recently uploaded a video to Twitter in order to test how many views and how much revenue it could get on the platform it seems that Twitter being the you know totally um Fair platform that it is you know Town Square Etc decided to put a Thum on the scale Mr BEAST's video was
heavily promoted by official Twitter accounts by Elon Musk himself and by Twitter's advertising platform as an unlabeled ad very cool uh many Twitter users complained that the video was absolutely everywhere and that they would sometimes see it again and again while they were scrolling uh it was only obvious that the post was classified as an ad if the user clicked on a drop down  below report ad why this ad uh Mr Beast made around a quar million dollars from this video which he
has already allocated to prizes in a giveaway I believe he actually announced the winners of the of the giveaway today he gave 10 random followers on Twitter "$25,000 " each um so our discussion question is what is the point of this they gave Mr Beast a big hunk of cash that they know is not representative of typical revenue for a video on the site I think they were hoping to get away with it if Jimmy's future content doesn't perform the same way that this one did he's not going to keep uploading
if other creators see you singling out Jimmy and then don't achieve similar  uploading yeah yeah my assumption is they uh were're hoping they wouldn't notice look with all of that said if Twitter configure this out if they can be a viable video platform with actual you know Evergreen content discoverability because that's what YouTube does yeah that's what YouTube does well that Twitter sucks at pretty much everyone sucks at hey uh I'm I'm kind of a video creator like are are sorry I'm sorry are we talking
incremental views like like bigger audience okay sign me up there is no competing VOD platform but so if there was a competing VOD platform that would be good for everyone I hate Twitter I I am on extensively on record very much disliking Twitter oh yeah and it has nothing to do with the chief twit right now it doesn't actually you've hated just always hated Twitter but if there was a competing vaud platform that was viable yes that would be good for everyone but it would have to actually
be competing which has been the problem every time y so like good luck all right good luck everybody Netflix that's not yeah that's very different thing yeah uh we're talking user generated content mhm I am going to go switch us to W show after dark so our little sign on the monitor finally oh oh oh oh oh RTX video HDR AI upscaling oh yeah right yeah yeah I um uh I don't know if we're going to make a video about it I I want to but we have so many projects right now it's that post CES boom yeah um it looks
super cool but I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet basically what Nvidia is doing is kind of like what they announced a fairly recent I guess I was months ago was it a year ago I don't know whatever a while ago um kind of like what Nvidia announced a while ago where they are able to upscale in real time video that you are watching on your system if you have an Nvidia GPU was pretty power hungry when I first tried it but it was also really impressive like 1080p video looked way better like
they could deblock and D noise um it it it seemed to be the solution or a solution to low qual low bit rate streaming artifacts and so this is not the solution but a solution to the enormous catalog of standard dynamic range content that exist exists out there and getting some kind of investment or getting some kind of return out of your investment into an HDR Monitor and an HDR capable system with that content it looks amazing Luke you've got it up there uh no I was trying to test
something all right you're doing something else entirely totally off topic not even focused on it wasn't off topic not even focused on hosting a show with me it was not off topic there are comments there are comments about how the HDR video from Nvidia is not an HDR I'm going to have to beat you especially badly at Super checks tonight my you said you want to get home early oh I'm still playing Super check you just want to play Super checks earlier I mean but I was trying to figure out if
your if your device doesn't have HDR can you not select HDR um I I don't think you'd be able to if you don't have an HDR display how is it going to HDR anything that's just not how that works so so when this person said that they uploaded it without HDR I was like are they actually right I don't know I can't tell though but it is what it is okay so you're looking at it now okay let's look yeah okay uh well that that's a terrible example yeah that original video looks  SDR okay I mean yeah okay it's boosting
the highlights a bit dark scenes in SDR can be difficult dark scenes in HDR can be difficult to watch so let's see let's see let's see let's see this is a game too interesting interesting I oh could it just transform absolutely everything on your screen into HDR wow would that have to be banned in certain competitive games I don't know that's pretty cool "though how does this only have 100,000" views this is sick I don't know okay I don't know maybe we should do a video about it I don't know the best video
you've ever seen it's pretty cool though  Nvidia won't let you enable the HDR setting unless you enable hdr on Windows yeah that that makes sense because your monitor would have to be receiving metadata from your operating system like all Nvidia is doing is taking that SDR content you're playing back and interpreting it into HDR metadata  understand yeah so I think the comments are probably right I I I don't think they uploaded this video in HDR which is hilarious there's
a lot of comments about it um King Fish watch on YouTube said showcasing an AI HDR tone mapping by converting both SDR and HDR samples to SDR is a truly big brain move you know what would have worked better actually is if they filmed the screen believe it or not that I I forget why it works but you would be able to see the difference more even if they uploaded it in SDR that makes sense it like does sort of I guess but yeah it's it's still weird it's mind breaking math but no an SDR video of the same camera
filming an SDR screen and an HDR screen does not look the same yeah you can see that the HDR one is better don't ask me why I'm going to go switch this over to wo after dark okay sounds good Danny you  okay cool I was like we don't technically know if he's still [Laughter] here to bed I don't know yeah he could be pulling one of those things where he like works his other job during W show oh yeah you know the whole the whole thing where you're remote and you just like have two jobs or whatever it's like
and then we like we switch over to producer camera I get to switch the window oh oh sorry yeah yeah I'm awake I'm I'm here I'm here all right what are we up to Dan uh gez I guess we're doing merch messages aren oh geez a gez I guess it's merch message time jez oh geez you know I haven't watched the new season without Justin royland is it any good anyone know no idea oh okay cool well it just signed me out of the merch message dashboard so that's awesome cool do you want me to wait
nope okay hey dlll are you worried about Labs pulling an Icarus anything you're doing to ensure it doesn't how has it not already pulled an Icarus at this point we're just rebuilding it better than before I mean so  wax and to be clear that that that's we put reinforcements in the wax that's not that's not on that's not on Labs gotus you got Icarus yeah all the uses yeah that's that that's not all that's not on Labs there's there's a lot of factors that played into everything uh but the
reality of it is we're just going to we're just going to keep doing our thing guys we're going to keep improving and you guys are going to see it and you're either going to accept it or you're going to put your fingers in your ears I can't see this I can't see this the choice is yours do you think that the Intel plants in Ohio will eventually make their prices more userfriendly also how crazy is it that them and Google have decided to start focusing on expansion in Ohio um I mean it's probably
cheap I I mean Micron has demonstrated that you can build a tech Hub anywhere we did that uh facility tour in Idaho of all places so what's Idaho known for chips and chips and it's not like they don't have super smart people there and it's not like the people there aren't pragmatic intelligent people who are like hm well I could work in in Silicon Valley where I spend you know however many tens of thousands of dollars a year on housing or I could live in Idaho and spend basically nothing on
housing but still have my big penis Tech celery gee let me think and so I think was also like beautiful isn't it if you if you have the kind of poll that an Intel and a Google might then you can basically make a tech Hub you you kind of decide where it is so yeah it makes  me lonus in Riley's Tech upgrade you started talking about a closet PC you once had but got sidetracked by rocket League hype can you finish that anecdote uh that really was the whole thing I I had it so that when I tucked in my chair
my whole closet it was a like a twodo like accordion style door closet it and it would close so that if I optimistically ever brought a girl into my room never happened um the there would be no gaming PC I mean I'd still have a cringe futon oh man yeah my high school bedroom  bedroom yeah hey dll line us with the recent quick bits slip up have you ever considered that not embracing the phrase could be detrimental to the TechLink and game link brands also thanks for the
quality tools I don't even remember how the whole thing started maybe I thought it was just like arbitrary having some of the titles called something and some of them not called something or maybe they used to always call them something different back in the day before they standard I I don't even know but I I if anything I think it's better for the TechLink gamelink brand that I continue to refuse to say it because uh they have a lot of fun trying to get me to say it and I have a lot of fun not
saying it so uh no I think we'll keep it up and no problem enjoy your quality tools I recently went shopping for a mouse and hated the experience because I want the best one how would the experience be for comparing peripherals  website um we're going to have to figure that out yeah we're going to have a lot of work to do on that some of it's going to be charts and graphs if we can do things more visually I mean that's what we are we're a media company we're going to do our best with it but I think what
you're going to see at the beginning is minimum viable product which is going to be charts and graphs and text and then over time we're going to try to expand on that slash utilize the labs data to put together more compelling video content that we think you guys will really enjoy we shot a video today that I'm really excited about um okay if you're not Canadian you won't have heard of these guys but Princess Auto is basically the Harbor Freight of Canada it's like where you go to get a
$3 socket set you know um might be a little more than that but and so we were there we were there picking up something because we needed some cheap something and something caught our eye I thought it'd be a little bit more and it is a little bit more but it's not as much more as I expected it's 10 bucks yeah there you go for for deep ones too yeah exactly that's what I'm talking about Princess Auto baby and that's 10 Canadian dollars yeah so that's about $7 so I'm really not that far off no not
really okay it's more than double but we're talking four bucks yeah so anyway uh Princess Auto we were there picking up something and uh someone snapped a picture of what looks like a razor display whole bunch of peripherals upon closer inspection the brand is in fact not snake themed but rather dart frog so we bought them all obviously um and I think this video is really cool because it's a perfect example of what we want this kind of content to be hey here's something you
might want to know about whether it's uh you know a diamond in the rough power supply or a uh a motherboard that actually impacts performance you know Finding interesting stories and not just doing your basic YouTuber reaction but also backing it up with hard data so it has a combination of what would be like a classic LTT unboxing SL experiential video with Labs data that helps to quantify what it is that we're seeing and what we're feeling really cool video it'll be coming in a while just shot
today so probably be a couple weeks dart frog is that the name of the company here hold on I'll be right back uh want to do a merch message while I uh sure got one for me Dan uh for you specifically Let's see we just a general one I know hello I met you at LTX and asked how your fitness journey was going how's it been since then and where are your fitness goals for 2024 still recomping uh yeah to be honest uh not not as good as they were as as Dan knows because I've been complaining
to Dan about it um I got sick for like a really long time a very long time I was very very sick for like two weeks um and I was already upset about the impact from just that and then I had this weird you might have even noticed it on Wan show where sometimes something in my throat would just get caught and I couldn't breathe anymore and I'd have to clear it um there was literally I think like a month or two of that uh just on wano cuz I would start talking emphatically and
then and then I'd have to clear it uh and that was scary because a lot of things that I liked doing while I was working out might be a bit of a problem if you very suddenly unexpectedly couldn't breathe um so I decided to take time off from that um I started going again I think it was 2 or 3 weeks ago and then had to take a break for a a curling tournament some other things and now I'll be I'll be going again on Tuesday so I lost some progress but um it's been going pretty well my my goals
for the end of the year are not really fixed though to be honest I I do usually like monthly or quarterly Style Style  okay do I need to close my eyes um no okay okay the game is called dart frog  okay okay maybe you do need to close your eyes yeah I thought so okay okay so all you're allowed to do you only get a flash so like a blink an opposite blink that's all you get an opposite blink oh okay yeah got it okay okay so you'll do we'll do a and b okay okay go that was a really long Flash I I
didn't like see I thought it was going to be here I really didn't see it okay hold on hold on hold on okay here's me that was too long I looked for too long I thought the first one was razor until you showed me the second box and then I looked for too long at the second  does dang it Loop anyway the point is it's going to be a good video wow don't miss it even even from here yeah I know wow yeah I know wow they even I didn't actually bring this up in the video that's crazy but do you notice how prominently
they put the word laser everywhere on it oh wow wow that's a little that's a little scummy wow everything about it is scummy laser is very close to razor the dart frog is very similar to the snake combination is um yeah it's be good honestly if I hadn't seen them yet looking at this angle like here I wouldn't be able to tell yeah I know I can't make out the logo and being able to make out the logo is honestly the only way you can tell yeah that's wild it's gonna be a really good video don't 
wow uh all right Dan sry yeah lonus what do you think of the rumor Intel is going to kill off hyper threat reading I mean sure I'm not a CPU architect if they think that's a good idea then it's probably not a terrible idea if there's other ways that they can deliver the performance their customers expect um this is another thing we've got a video coming on recently so we finally covered meteor Lake we look at integrated GPU performance we talk about the new core Ultra branding and one of the things I
say this is not investment advice I am not a financial advisor is long-term Intel just took a beating okay so I'm going to say it again this is not Financial advice I'm not a financial adviser um don't come angrily screaming back if this goes for until just took a beating but I love where they're looking longterm um I don't because the igpu stuff or just in general in general I don't know if they're going to be you know five bagger or if they're going to lose all your money I don't know I'm I'm
not a financial adviser uh but I talk about this in in the video I I love their tiled their first shot at a tiled uh CPU are they gluing stuff together now they're gluing it real good really like it um oh boy J 529 says I'm buying Boeing what do you think lonus I think I'm not a   um yeah cool anyway yeah if they if they say look we're not going to do hyperthreading we're going to do efficient cores or we're going to have these okay so they have new efficient cores low power efficient cores that are
on um like the S so tile rather than the compute tile and what's really cool about these is they can light these ones up to like handle a Windows update in the background or whatever and they don't even have to have the main cores turn on at all like okay not at all is a bit of an overstatement but that's cool though yeah it's pretty good for power savings to be clear AMD is still very competitive right now and we're going to see new stuff from them hopefully in the nearish future I mean 780m their mobile
GPU has been around for a while um rna4 though like where you at dog um so we'll see we'll see but I I am sure they're not down and out I am liking where Intel is heading I really like their move into  parties hi guys will the stubby with Black Shaft get back into stock or is the notification option more like a poll thanks for an update we've never said never um I think we've always said not  issues with our black finishes okay to be clear this is actually a different thing I'm just
teasing uh this is standardized aluminum and we would not make a screwdriver shaft on something that you can really torque um out of aluminum um we are still exploring black finish options we have not settled on anything that we would consider to be acceptable to bring back black shafts yet hey W.D pronounced d d I can't see that uh could you explain how YouTube premium works with monetization on YouTube I'm going to make basically just like YouTube shares ad Revenue with the creators that you watch
YouTube shares premium Revenue with the creators that you watch and it's divied up according to watch time so if you were to watch say for example 100 S and happiness one minute videos or if you were to sit through a third of a wow we would get half of it and cide and happiness would get half of it half of the allocation that YouTube gives to creators which is I it's either 60 or 70% I can't remember are you still using Theo Joe's comment moderation tool if so is it working no um honestly right now most of
our comment moderation is me and chewy our community coordinator um it seems to have helped a fair bit that every time I see a pornbot or a Spam bot or a spectacularly stupid person I'm just shadowbanning them and I think it's made at least the main Channel less of a Target I definitely see some more dumery on the sub channels um but we just didn't we didn't end up building a process that allowed us to run it forever and got distracted and hopefully YouTube Just fixes their stuff at some
point uh it's possible that the overall spam is just down on the platform and it has nothing to do with any of our moderation but um we're we definitely do see it and we're definitely stamping it down whenever we do I don't think they'll ever fix it yeah that's fair I think it's going to get worse sooner than gets better I I was uh a a friend of mine linked me a Twitter thread recently which was a very long Twitter thread that it took me a while of reading into because I was like he
wouldn't have sent this to me with no reason but he didn't explain why he was like just read this continue reading through these tweets and then eventually I realized it was a back and forth conversation between a very large amount of fake AI accounts but they were not promoting anything they were just building account cred a conversation while they so so they were incubating and I was like what the heck because it seems you know you know how a lot of AI output text is like too
clean it's too like kind of generic y it was all like that and the conversation started kind of looping a little bit and I was like what's going on because they're just riffing off of the previous tweets and there's realistically only so long that you could really do that and be original so they stopped being able to be original right and it was just like whoa it was it was very kind of eerie to read but yeah anyways moving on next good evening Duke Lan and DUS from Texas can we get
an update on backpack return I've been waiting to return mine for over a month now also how is shipping being handled uh that's a great question and I do not know exactly um the last thing I want to do is give you any false information but what I can do is get Dan to send a followup and um hopefully have an answer for you guys next week Dan can we do that yep I'll send a message to Nick or better if we don't talk about it next week then hopefully you'll have already heard from our customer care team so I
won't need to talk about it on wow that  ideal uh yeah one moment okay there we go I'll just leave that one there for the second um hi lldd how do you feel about Cloud flare I don't like that they control so much of the internet but I still use them because their products and prices are good almost free for what  for for like non-large infrastructure company users their pricing is insane um to the point where like not using them for a lot of things is is just kind of like weird and Ill advised um we use
them fairly heavily for vaud delivery on float plane um I could complain about that a lot um considering they're kind of like in action on fixing VOD delivery to uh most notably Australia and Germany but other places as well um we need to do more to fix that on our end but what we need to do to fix that on our end is to use more places than just Cloud flare more actively um which is unfortunate because you would hope that they would just do better at that um their core product is insanely good
um and and it's it's yeah I don't even really know what else to say their their core product is just insanely good it works um the fact that they don't have more outages is like wild um what a crazy company sometimes they can be frustrating to deal with um I'm not a fan as I've talked on on Wow before of calls where you just rotate your person that is the representative of that company every once in a while and they always want to have onboarding calls and it's really not productive for your company that
they just keep cycling people constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly and I wish that would wouldn't happen so much um and I wish they would care more about their side products but their core product is just wildly good um and their side products are are for the most part pretty solid as well um but yeah I don't know it's never really great when one company has so much market share in an area but um I will say while that goes poorly in a lot of Realms Cloud flare has
seemingly kept the quality of their core product up uh quite well so I'll give  that let's see what we got here hey LL minus D picking up another Wan hoodie my 8-year-old son loves the way my Wan hoodie looks and wants to match when have you found your kids wanting something just because you had one first every time seriously every single time I pick up my Ally my kids are like can I play and I'm like I use this maybe a couple times a week it sits idle the entire rest of the time just
use it just when you when you have your screen time just let me know and use it they only want it when I'm holding it food too like my kids are never like oh can I have a salad but if I'm eating Greek salad they come along they take all the tomatoes and all the feted cheese out it's  part okay let's see what else we got um hey lonus great job promoting screwdriver bits and I'm not going to be like I'm not going to be like no don't eat vegetables yes tomato is technically a fruit calm down
Reddit but like Banana's a berry man sorry weird sorry Dan sorry Dan sorry I thought bananas were actually herbs that doesn't check out yeah whatever uh great job on Pro great job on promoting screwdriver bits I just bought all six sets before the price goes up not that this is you but what's the worst company to threaten price increases as promotions okay I carried this but I couldn't think of one but I'm sure there's got to be examples of companies being like here's our big
sale you can have the old price before we raise it yeah I guarantee you it's got to be a thing like especially like software as a service companies and stuff like that hey lock in now or we're going to raise the prices hahaa got them so I was hoping chat could maybe pitch us a few Autodesk all early oh Early Access games the entire Kickstarter platform okay didn't think of that one pretty good that's pretty good I came up with that one yay that's literally kickstarter's whole thing yeah
well not really but that's how most kickstarters work you you get it for however much off now but our our our actual real price is coming later  October Chom did it a while ago apparently um Tesla has Tesla done that did they do that that one year when they were trying to hit a Target before end of year I have no idea that does sound kind of familiar meta Quest 2 okay there's lots of examples of this yeah this is totally a thing yeah super interesting a lot of isps apparently do it okay internet
access should only go down in price that's that's stupid Hulu apparently oh wow wow you guys are okay you guys are coming up with lots of examples Okay cool so this is a thing all right  will you do another month challenge if or when battle mage comes out cheers do you want to redo the arc challenge given that you are currently experiencing GPU related crashes and it is making your oh I'm I'm experiencing all related crashes that's fair um nice  lonus you know what else is crashing the
NCI sign PC it blue screens like once a day need to solve it I have me test okay I already turned off Expo I've already turned off like S3 like I I decided to run me test overnight because at least some of the errors I've been getting are reporting something that sounds like probably memory yeah um and it defaults to my far-left monitor I have three monitors yeah it defaults for my far left monitor whatever run the test go to bed wake up in the morning all my my monitors are black mhm like oh okay
Shake mouse keyboard stuff so see like did it boot into Windows somehow and go to sleep or does m test like screen off at a certain point nothing's responding I'm like so it crashed okay power off computer power computer back on um okay crap it booted into mest again whatever uh or no it it nothing happens no no yeah no it booted into m test again okay turn it off unplug the USB whatever get back into windows oh my left screen didn't turn on what's Happening oh Emma tried to very nicely save my
screen from burning and turned the monitor off oh nice so I just turned it off so I have no idea what happened to the test cool so I ran it before I left so hopefully when I get home I'll know if there's memory problems or not so um H I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler but uh probably shouldn't tell them I shouldn't tell them okay make sure you watch the video on his new build because um I think the title's going to be something like I have to get out of this contract or something like that it
doesn't get you out of the contract  um let's just say his troubles may be related to the 10 CPU test video we just did yeah I've been wondering that  hopefully that's not it hey Dan uh yeah sure um this is weird uh years ago you talked about becoming a real company that would survive without you and Aon inheritance tax was at the problem you hope to have a good plan someday do you now appreciate you guys um I've talked about this a number of times pretty much every time I do it
gets misunderstood or construed in some way remember backpack warranty gate when I went on that very very long thing where I was like well anything that we set up should be something that is resilient enough that it is not just based on the Goodwill of you know trust me bro um you know so that in the event that I died or whatever it would still be in place and we're still trying to figure out exactly what that would look like uh at the end of the day people said they don't want anything that
actually has any kind of teeth they just want us to give them a piece of paper that says okay yeah here's what it is um it's been really interesting watching the discourse shift on what I said um now it seems like most people get it all I was saying was that the warranty you have from whoever it is you have it from is only as good as their willingness to fulfill it because they can drag ass they can just disappear um there's plenty of companies that change warranty or uh claim warranty
violations for whatever BS reason any any warranty policy difficult to prove any warranty policy that would make it past any lawyer worth their salt is going to have uh a clause in there that basically says yeah the whole thing's at our discretion anyway um and so the point I had been trying to make way back then was that we wanted to it right as long as I am here you know whatever there's no way that I could screw you over because it would cause outrage proved my point Thank you guys
um and so I don't know uh coming coming back to your actual question I I don't know how to answer this without you know without it being misunderstood um inheritance tax is a problem um but I don't think that it will impact our ability to be a real company that will survive without us I think there are solutions um and it doesn't have to be that you know our kids inherit it or whatever else in fact I I haven't seen any indication that it would even be remotely appropriate for our kids to inherit the
company uh the last thing I would want to see is for it to just be and just some random you know Media Company acquisition holding Cod you know take it and and and and you know screw it up right um but we do have some ideas I I don't think I'm at a point now where I'm ready to say exactly how it would work yes we we do have trusts in Canada that is a thing that exists that is an option for um tax-free inheritance but there are a ton of limitations around them even understands it better than I
do it's it's not really viable if we plan to run the company for our lives and then um have some kind of sucession plan that involved our kids but I I don't know that it would um Urban fervor says I like how Matt Pat is doing it I actually haven't seen his approach wild how many YouTubers are just like retiring um I uh I called it on Tom Scott though I was like dude it's my age what he talking about retiring and he's already revised the title of his video and been like yo people for people who
didn't make it to the second sentence of my video it's I didn't mean like forever I mean he even he even said in um he's just he's he had he had a commitment to a certain amount of videos he's not doing weekly videos yeah yeah okay I mean he did clickbait it a little bit which is funny cuz I he and I have had some conversations about you know clickability and and whatever and it's like okay dude cuz that was pretty clickbait right there but sure um okay apparently Matt Pat's sold the
channel a year or two ago he's fulfilled his contract and stepping away so that's basically what we would have done if we had taken our offer yeah I just I wasn't ready yet um it's possible that we could do something like that but I don't looking back at it now the money would have been very good especially considering the challenges that we've faced this year right I would have been almost ready to walk away now like okay yeah whatever this is your mess to clean up now apparently um so the money would
have worked out really well but what I don't think would have worked out really well is the company I don't see why they wouldn't have just gone okay well this didn't work out and moved on to their next acquisition right and I think that it would have really impacted the people who work here and the people who really do care about what is it that we're trying to do yeah so I'm I'm really happy we didn't do it we're we've still  Business hi dll is there a product that still exists today named after an
outdated or expected but once Innovative feature take Windows for example symbolizing simultaneous open software windows I wasn't sure on this one I think Windows is a pretty good example I'm sure there's got to be other examples I don't know like RCA cable no not really sort of um a that still exists today oh hold on a second um um um um um movies oh we were just talking about this we were talking about this in the writing that's really that's a really good example you know like the Takis the
movies you know back when moving pictures you know the movies we don't even think about that anymore would this be the streames or films even I mean anything to do with production pretty much yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Fujifilm someone said as a as a company name the movie that's a company though that's not a product the movies though yeah I didn't realize it was product specific but yeah okay this is not really a product either but get over  yeah what do you think about Cooler
Master killing the original spec nr200 and completely killing the nr200 air cooler compatibility I did not understand this question I mean nr200 is presumably a case yeah um I small form factor case I had not been following any of this drama eventually you're going to stop making a product right so like why is this um completely killing the nr200 air cooler compatibility that I don't what are they talking about I don't know not sure I mean yeah you got to have kind of a you got to have kind of a target with
your product right so if you're if you're basically targeting water coolers and you've got kind of an idea for how the system should be built there's so many options for AOS I don't really think you can look at that and go like rude um it's a bummer if you wanted to do an aircooled nr200 build but these things kind of happen and if there's enough demand I'm sure they'll bring it back and if there isn't enough demand I guess they knew something you didn't yeah hey. dll any updated thoughts
regarding the process of the ex Escapist team over its second wind and their transparency publishing Det detailed monthly revenue reports that is a super super cool transparency commitment um I don't think I've ever seen anything like that from a from a from a private group like a private company um viewership looks consistent pretty in the range for what they were doing before the subscriber count um it also looks very similar to what they're doing before like fully rambl Matic which is
um full punctuation yeah man there's so many things we made videos about this week we have a reference to this that I think you guys will find quite funny in one of our videos oh um yeah I'm not going to I'm not going to spoil it watch every video haahha got him got um okay where where are they publishing this I assume they have uh okay here a patreon it's not like they could have been on float plane or whatever no problem don't don't bother reaching out to us it doesn't matter uh the point is I guess
they probably have some articles or something I guess you would have to be a patron to see them I don't I don't know where they publish these things look at that "support 14,18 paid members at that's" "awesome 8,660 a month good on you guys" it's a million bucks a year that's fantastic that's fantastic good job very cool really rooting for these guys uh the income report is in the YouTube post section apparently so like Community posts I guess oh yeah okay we're two weeks out from when we started taking
salaries hey good for you guys freaking  it premium Discord all right whatever I'm just rooting for them so good job you guys cool that's all I have to say about that yeah mad respect hey D the line is how's the relationship of long-term money per view compared to uh compared between an LTT video one that could be relevant at any time and a tech or gamelink video where it really matters to watch right now uh viewership falls off a cliff for anything news related I don't even know how Google
quite tells what's news related and what's not but they do uh they can tell and uh there are some LTT videos I mean we made a we made a video reacting to our most profitable videos uh way back when and almost all of them were LTT videos with a ton of views or LT live stream archives that had monstrous watch time so they made a ton of money from YouTube premium uh for something like TechLink or gamelink basically we're just relying on whatever it gets within the first couple of weeks and there's
almost no long-term tail on any of it if I were to take our our entire Content Library and sort by I can't sort by most Revenue so whatever I guess um I won't be able to give you any additional information but it will be way less way  and I guess if you want to read this one you can I don't know how you no I don't think we're supposed to I think um can you just flag that for someone to get in touch with Sergio Sergio I I've sent it to stepen okay Sergio we are acknowledging your message hey thanks
for the merch message and I'm going to  cool umam a couple coming yeah Adam asks if I have any issues with games crashing on the RG Ally I really haven't but I haven't played a huge variety of games on mine so my my experience may not mirror your own and James asks if we have any Insider news on Steam deck B button sticking issues no I do not I've still been on my Ally it's uh the the the better performance has kept me but there are definitely games I'd rather play on the better screen um I'm just
not playing any of them right now um hey thanks Christopher appreciate you showing that don't agree but hey your message is going to come up in the scrolly thing and that's it we will see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel how did this last for three and a half hours  topics it's just is what it is we reacted to our own video which I would be really interested to see the metrics on maybe we should do that more content  is come on man say the line world's slowest byy got
him oh wait we're not going to be able to hear Dan yeah I'm going to put those back on we we both took our headphones off we're like uh wait we can't talk to Dan  vessie
