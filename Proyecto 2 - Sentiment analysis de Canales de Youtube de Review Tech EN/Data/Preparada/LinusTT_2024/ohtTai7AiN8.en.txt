everyone starts out knowing nothing we eventually learn but not without some hard painful lessons thankfully we've got the best medicine for that laughter good company and origin PC who sponsored this video with their Eon 16x and Eon 15 SL laptops so come along with us as we laugh together at some of the internet's worst tech support Gore like this one removing Ram from a computer oh my God you know what I've actually done that one time oh I've totally done this it's super cool I did to the school computers
in high school and we're off to a great start did it look like this you know I try to just block that memory out of my mind what were you thinking uh that it was off oh my God you did it on by accident oh yeah you know what's great though I've seen it where you can actually rip out RAM sticks and the computer will work for a little bit of time as long as it doesn't try to access whatever was in that particular stick of Ram or doesn't try to write to it because the computer
still thinks it'll have 8 GB yeah or whatever you had right like this looks like somebody took one stick out and then the system was like where did those bits go I don't like this and that's what happened someone unplugged something and now the office internet doesn't work oh my God you know what's crazy our server room looked like that it wasn't this bad it was that bad it wasn't this bad I mean that should be easy to figure out though just find your modem I mean you
know you can figure that out potentially yeah it depends on what you unplugged and if you actually have everything documented I understand how it happens and you know what a lot of the time it's not the fault of the people who are actually in charge of admitting the thing some third party contractor will come in they won't label anything and then your boss is breathing down your neck or your team is breathing down your neck to get their systems back up and running you go okay well I've solved it
now I'll label it later times 15 years plan a burn the office down no one looks for a bullet in a bombing custom Loop oops oh God I hold on hold on no I see it already there's some things about this that look very good the orientation of the radiator will help the air bleed out of  going no had nothing to do with that what I had to look away what where did it where did the seal break it didn't look like the tubes can you play in slowmo on this don't have the O-rings in the CPU BL it's
there though no the O-ring is not in I have seen this happen this generation of block needed to be disassembled in order to change out the mountain remember yeah I totally remember it that's horrible if you forget to put the O-ring in hey that don't seal this is salvageable but my God this is why when you test your water cooling Loop you do it with water not the like Blue Smurf vomit it whatever the hell that is y oh that's blue fortnite chug jug here we're overanalyzing it big brain yeah well
with the higher level of water in the loop you could have the pressure and the gravity no they don't have an o-ring in it I should tell them it's not a  [Laughter] oh oh okay why is everything they want to touch right in the center Apple if this isn't enough evidence that you need to make your deves touchcreen I don't know what will be what it looks like they were drawing here what are they drawing are they trying to summon some Demon it's like someone just lotioned up and went to town on the monitor dude
someone's using lotion at their desk for this you can tell holy but I like it this way it's conven oh my God okay yo this is you like in another life I didn't even realize how bad this was does it work I mean that's a cool function if you could make it work that way like if your pH would yeah I'm I'm all for it when I first looked at this I was seeing the glass and I was seeing a phone propped on the glass and I was like man you go and touch that phone it's going to knock over the glass your
phone's going to get I thought it was like a battery pack yeah I didn't even notice that the phone is split apart yeah and then the liquid would spill directly into it but you know you what you can also do is just lean the phone against the glass oh yeah oh can you see them in the thing yeah you could see them oh yeah absolute Giga Chad right there is that Elijah okay that's gross Go full screen we need to zoom in I don't know if I don't know if I can handle that no oh no this is actually disgusting
look it's convenient so he's got Heineken and Red Bull and Red Bull lots of smok lots of smoke is that pudding in the bottom left dude dude the top of the desk is the tip of this garbage Bird yeah but look at the screen look go up up up up up see like he they're showing it Power Aid got to stay healthy you know why do you say healthy and there's like 17 packs worth of cig stay hydrated I guess that looks like dude that looks I think that's piss oh no oh God are those pea
bottles oh no oh no why would you leave them open yeah that's the problem Jake and they're on the look I this just just seems fake like I want to know if this is staged and I think we can figure it out look at this banana this banana has not been there that long you know you're right A lot of it looks too new like why are all the McDonald's cups like so pristine and like the Red Bull can's not crumpled I mean maybe this is just a hard day's work you're drinking a lot you're going to be peeing a lot maybe
they take pride in their degeneracy like they've been like this for a long time yeah check the comments let's see what the comments think it's just apple juice how is that possible are those Splitters what am I looking at wait go go back are those like those two inone ethernet splitters that we did a video on yeah looks like that like don't work what are they they can work if you use them the right way okay cuz you can use only four wires and so if you split the two pairs
or two sets of four wires you can use that way for like cat five or whatever but look at all the empty ports on the switch above them why are they splitting like what are they doing I don't know what's going on with that what is the point okay well what's on the next rack oh God the floor oh you can't even walk in here oh the wires hanging from rack to Rack really pisses me off more in all honesty what am I even looking at like this is a huge building with a non-trivial number of
people presumably who are being paid which tells you already that whatever company is operating here has a non-trivial amount of Revenue that they clearly do not invest in it who hurt you who hurt you that's like if somebody calls you to come work on this when you walk in the room you just go I'm a bill you hourly no you go you turn you turn around and you leave no I'd take it what dude no I'd take the money no I take the money you know what it seems like everyone in the comments are on your
side I'll be paid hourly please it's got to be hourly there's no way I would quote the job because clearly that's cobbled together from generations of of a hardware nothing like malicious compliance speaking of malicious compliance our sponsor wants me to talk about the Eon 16x but I'm going to do it my way it's got a 2560 x600 16in display running at 240 HZ for a smooth gaming experience but if you want to use another display like we are today it's got a ton of options for I/O it's got
Thunderbolt 4 which makes outputting video or connecting to a dock super easy it's got USB 3.2 Gen 2 type-c which supports display port and Power and it's got good oldfashioned HDMI 2.1 plus unlike many modern devices it's got three USB typea ports and a headphone mic combo Jack what it doesn't have is what we're about to look at my heart stopped beating that looks like our set oh I've seen this oh my God this is Sarah oh good it's us oh no it's us why oh God I remember this oh yeah oh God it's not 
Crunchy just ganking it out oh Sarah please just the the physical pain of lus is great here this is just as hard to watch the second time this is the worst one so far like actually oh no this got "7,000 up votes to be fair the computer" worked after this Microsoft please remove the nightmare that his SK from  these were Dark Times all right that's enough of that oh my goodness oh wow oh God you want to touch a Wi-Fi there now look accessibility is a good thing yeah this wasn't the right way to do it yeah
no so this is argument for Imaging things oh yes that's a great skipping all this garbage yeah so sometimes when you have to do Mass installs for a office or a school you can set up one laptop and then use Microsoft's Imaging to create that and install it on multiple devices yeah that way you don't have to listen to a thousand cortas yeah you make the user do it with the Autobox experience exactly there's got to be a phobia of this people repeating the same thing over and over again the voices
it manager workstation user one is the domain admin password is was the LED name really I thought Windows doesn't even let you do that this Windows 7 dude what I just like how sorry who is this user one is the domain admin at least it's not just password that's worse because at least with password they'd have to guess this is just telling you what the password is that's fair yeah hey well the good news is when they fire their it manager they won't have any trouble getting into the
system yeah exactly I mean there's nothing like building out and maintaining a fancy authentication system and then just making the password the username just don't have it then this is the kind of office where like no one's really in charge of it oh yeah right someone has to go kick the rotor right like this guy's leading the horse to water right here yeah holy single cat 5e holding up a rack huh oh they' tied it on here I'm so uncomfortable oh I've seen this one yeah yeah yeah uh-huh mhm oh my gosh that's
mint I'm so mad this one really bothers me I'm confused now cuz it should like hook in here yeah why did they take it down it probably fell you know what I bet it is I think the Deep stuff is too deep to fit in it but then they've got stuff just hanging out the front anyway okay so it must sit in the bottom portion like it came out yeah here's the pills that help them feel better yeah we'll just we'll just tie this ethernet cable we've done Jank but I this is bad this is terrible don't do that at all why my
internet keeps dropping oh is this just like follow the cable okay is there going to be a cat at one end of it this has got to be a cat is this the power cable it's a phone line it looks like no that's the power cable okay okay Power up over there the heck is going on okay we're going okay is this going to be a jump scare are we going to get huh to another Power oh my God don't do that don't daisy chain well are we going down into the basement did we just we're in the basement now is he a crack sha another
power adapter surely he's got a closer power connection is the house not wired for electricity except for one Outlet in the basement somewhere no this legitimately possible just open across the floor like the neighbor's house another Power connector what the sorry pardon my language it looks like Asia light switch oh there is so much wrong with that you know what's funny is I went through this with yvon's phone not charging and I realized that her phone charger was plugged into the bedside yeah yeah I got
you and it's got a light switch for yeah yeah it took me it took me like an embarrassing amount of time to figure out why sometimes it didn't work I'm surprised it booted I mean the mm doesn't take a ton of power probably so I mean but with how much other daisy chaining stuff we don't know what was on the other end of those 18 fridges on it who knows what else yeah powering the neighborhood grow up yeah yeah grow up God damn it Chromebooks returned end of the year yeah yep yeah I at my school we
had a laptop program we had thinkpads kids did the worst stuff to their laptops why would you do this a child this isn't your property so In fairness though it's kind of a Vibe I kind of like it Halloween who needs H key when you have Halloween key yeah they're like legitimately using it to learn a for apple what else we got here there's more pictures too oh is there yeah on the right let's see if  pimpology I'll Thunder your  grandmother that's not that bad that one's pretty tasteful yeah I like this
one yeah book definitely Chromebook it's done with like watercolor paint like they did this in art class this is pretty tasteful you know what else is tasteful is the back of the origin laptops with the next talking point no it's too soon too it's so such a good no it's seg way do okay fine okay fine we'll talk about Origins UV printing there this was done in a tasteful way as well with the Eon 16x and the 15sl you can add your choice of HD UV prints or laser etching to make them unique and
while they're not going to be able to fix what we just saw if you do have any issues you can always call their support line for helping hand okay user spilled coffee on his laptop oh no and put it in the oven no oh a think pad too oh there's so much wrong with that sentence and that is a fraction of how dead everything inside it is now the best part is think pads have drainage holes in them usually so your liquid will flow through it that is true that is some ThinkPad laptops not
all of them yeah but still with coffee you probably want to take it apart to get some of the gunk out cuz it's not just water if it just black coffee maybe you're okay butar going to something in there right yeah but not the oven that's the tldr no not the oven the nipple is fine though you can still use that laptop fireproof nipple yeah you lost the F key entirely you can't pay any  F oh man person mistook LED polarizing film for protective plastic and peeled  no I'm actually impressed that they were
able to get that much of it off I hope you didn't want to close any programs ever again I think we have an old video on this where you can actually take that film and like make glasses out of it so you can have like a private screen it's also a super fun science project by the way get your kids to do that it's super super cool I mean like don't use a good laptop the Eon 16x is way overkill for what we're doing today day but it's got a sleek and compact design and manages
to pack in an Intel Core i 94 14900 HX an RTX 490 mobile GPU Wi-Fi 60 64 gigs of RAM and 3 terab of total system storage on Samsung 990 Pro nvme drives moving on Hospital server room yeah don't go to this Hospital you're going to die hey battery backup though that's a big one so that's something a UPS ain't saving you like one pair of scissors who knows knows who's dying yeah like holy wonder what this bracket is from hey they made sure they didn't lose the screws though they're right
there it's for the UPS top comments probably like I know which cable or something found Waldo click on that what is click on the link oh there's a guy there's a guy go back to the picture no shot top middle scroll down a little to the right yeah he's right there you can see  man the guy that noticed that is wild user dropped it walking to the car it came in the day after the Super Bowl you are so full of you sir that is not from being dropped that's a I lost my bet or did he spike it in
Victory maybe you know uh yeah depends on how he came in that day was he upset or happy yeah there's no way that's a drop oh no I can totally see what happened here yeah yeah literally you can see the bend yeah dropped it while walking to the car yeah I dropped it while walking to the car and then I drove over it seven times customer came in with his iPhone his glass cracked he thought he could peel off the glass so he wouldn't notice the crack anymore what I mean mission accomplished I mean
yeah I don't see the crack much I can  crack how do you even go go that far it would have broken about halfway like why' you keep committing to it it's like some real methhead energy or something I don't know why did you keep going gouged the out of it didn't you reach a point where you were like maybe I should stop he he missed some glass here there's still glass here yeah he left some of the crack yeah that's the problem with this Jordan that hey like my God fair enough
I need somewhere to set this candle yeah not there oh they put it on top of a computer it dripped through the top grill it's like someone barked Pepto-Bismol into the cage the two capacitors on the bottom right make it look like Kirby Kirby has consumed This Server no I know what it is it's got to be like a cable box that would also explain why somebody has a candle on it yeah it looks like there's like RCA jacks or yeah I think this is a cable box oh gross is wax conductive I don't think so cuz like I
I'd be curious on if this PC as long as it didn't get in anything major maybe it still works it'd be warm well cleaning out a PC belonging to a cutting Stone Shop oh god well you're going to want a mask for that it doesn't stop there's a learnable here there's a reason those computers that are passively cooled like the industrial computers yeah there's a reason they exist bro probably going to have like as best as poisoning after whatever he's blown out of there cuz that's nuts what's the top comment
what's the top comment so gross holy it doesn't stop it's because Loops I spit I'm so sorry but I I spit actually that was the funniest followup comment it's cuz the give Loops DB anyway you need to be using a passive computer a sealed one yeah for this yeah we have one in our shop for that reason well hang on folks we've got another quick word from origin piece here it's all about their Eon 15 SL if you need something a little smaller with a little less horsepower at a lower price the 15
SL might be for you it's still got a 240 HZ 2560 x600 display along with most of the same iio we saw earlier it's a great option for anyone gaming on the go now this oh my goodness my space heater stopped working I think a lot more probably stopped how do you even do that's straight up so dangerous is terrifying don't plug a space heater into a power bar and if you do don't plug in anything else no just don't yes but if you do no just don't it even says on the cable I know yeah but they also
they compounded the error Jake they compounded it this is a compound error  heater so do you think the SP how does it how does it get that far and like you don't that's a good point too yeah like how do you get to this point and nothing failed beforehand this is every level of scary yeah when it wasn't a phone holder after all oh no oh I've seen this one oh my god when it wasn't a phone holder oh wait wait wait wait now you can just lift the screen up and hold it up with a
drink for like angling no no just peel it peel off the glass Parts oh cuz the part under it is flexible you could do both is that for like ventilation that's supposed I don't what is that for I don't know yeah you can't even access it it's not very big I what is that for it's not a phone it's not a phone holder though someone's going to know let us know in the comments I have no idea tragedy customer put toilet paper between CPU and the cooler because he read online it was almost as good uh the
worst part is this looks like it was running for a while it looks burnt like it's got dust and stuff built up kind of where it would be and such zoom in are you serious it looks almost like it's kind of like just turned into powder and the thing is that with a processor from this era the computer would probably work a fair bit it would just thermal throttle to hell in back mhm and the performance would suck what article would that have been was it AI you know what when was this post made
Let's close out of the uh just hit the X and top right yeah years ago this would not have been generative AI uh yeah no it's not as good as thermal paast please use thermal past don't do that yeah or PTM 7950 LTD store.com there you go bend it except oh my God love the edit the edit makes it so much better the little just like this is nothing compared to the time we had the editors build their own workstations and one of them Dennis one of them Dennis screwed the motherboard into the motherboard back
plate without a standoff when the rest of the board was secured with standoffs yeah was it Dennis and then proceeded to edit on that machine for several years it was definitely Dennis I believe it was Dennis okay end user had a heater next to the PC was randomly shutting off she thought she smelled burning a couple of times it is literally screaming yeah look at the US I can see the little face with the audio and it's literally like it's probably fine yeah but like oh
at my old job I 100% saw this yeah I had a client who their computer was shutting off randomly and they couldn't figure out what the source was but they had a heater by their feet and the computer was under the desk so it kept shutting the computer off so I this is probably more common than we would ever like to admit it looks like it's just the bezel at least too it's not like the cases and yeah as long as there's no longevity of heat damage to any of the components right all right we got a couple more
here down to the last ones when Amazon support told me to bake my SSD in the oven may I know what happened here I'll I'll be I'll be Amazon you be Amazon all right may I know what happened yes I connected this SSD to my computer I tried both slots and my motherboard did not detect it I have another SSD and it works perfectly in both slots thank you for the information if I may ask do you have your internal SSD right now the Western Digital one that I bought from Amazon yes perfect can you please try to
remove the RAM and then put it back that's a bit of a Twist okay it is a Karen oh it says Karen customer serice oh two RS yeah all right in my computer I'm using that to talk to you yes please so polite the ram SE is correctly I can assure you of that also if I did that I would have to end this call I do understand that this might be weird but I'll assure you that this will work try to preheat your oven oh my God preheat your oven to 150° F he just goes with it how much is that in Celsius the bot
recommends them because they have a broken m.2 SSD to pull the ram out of their system preheat their oven to bake the ram did they say to put it on tin foil too wrap the ram tightly in tin foil so bake the ram bake the ram that is a wild I mean look reflowing things in an oven can work as a temporary measure to maybe pull data off of it if a if a solder joint has has failed don't try to justify anything from I mean I've done I've done data recovery we had to freeze the hard drive so the opposite opposite
direction of heating okay that's fine and you especially shouldn't put your RAM in the oven if you have a broken SSD and leave the power cable connected while you're baking it all right on to the next one so this is why we don't run a 50ft budget HDMI cable yes you've been there oh yeah usually like this is more than we usually get with long this is pretty good for a super long cable they're lucky they got anything do you remember 16k gaming and the hell we went through with the cables
on that I do yeah that's how I found infinite cables that makes sense yeah they were the only ones that had a decent quality long display port C in Canada that could ship quickly dude we bought so many cables for that stupid video yeah like I think probably four or five different sets I mean the the right side of the screen is okay just keep your Discord on the right side exactly I hope you all had as much fun as we did I just want to take another moment to once again thank our sponsor
origin PC whether you need a balls to the wall Max out Eon 16x or something a little more modest like the Eon 15s Origins got you covered you can check them out using the link down below if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the one where we roasted our colleagues gaming setups
