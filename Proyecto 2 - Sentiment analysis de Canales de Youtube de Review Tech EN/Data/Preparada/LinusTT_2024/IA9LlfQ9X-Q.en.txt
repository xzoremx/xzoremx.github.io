did you know that on Facebook and Twitter about a quarter of the posts you see are ads I'm serious go ahead and check for yourself I'll wait now that you're back did you buy or even click on any of that stuff you saw no well don't worry that's okay cuz we did it for you for an entire month our team forwarded every ad they saw to the procurement Department who furiously sourced everything from whatever this is to keyboard cleaners to this build it-yourself conference room
now now all I need to do is unbox them and see if there's any golden nuggets in the nasal cavity that is modern social media advertising now there were some limits we didn't buy any software or anime video games it had to be a physical item we also wanted things that were Tech related and they had to be available in Canada which is why we're starting off with this do you want to "guess the price I'm going to say $4,000" "it was $10,000 10 grand yes" I mean it feels pretty nice but is that
Canadian dollars or us that's real dollars Freedom dollars at that price it better keep you guys from hearing this our spor kiwi design upgrade your quest 3 or Quest 3s with their G4 Pro Controller covers and K4 boost battery strap they're designed to give you more battery life and better Comfort learn more at the link in the video  whoa did lights just turn on in here yeah the sensors are behind here so as we're moving everything out oh dude it it's got fans yeah it's got ventilation
okay if I had known about all the features I might have guessed the price a little bit closer that's pretty cool there's also some Outlets back here that you're missing oh not going to lie a lot of this looks like AliExpress garbage correct but the bedjet man when I was a kid this would have saved me so much trouble I wouldn't have had to wet it myself oh my God now that it's time to oh oh okay adjust the this one that's probably that second light that Logistics didn't plug in oh that makes
sense it actually took him about a day to build this they didn't say it was tough but it was just a long process it's fine yeah actually Alex said that he thinks it's worth it because over the last two weeks that it's been installed we've had several people actually just have their meetings in here and enjoy it okay so here's the ad that sold us on it oh I get to watch the ads there you go nice in the emergency stairwell just to get some privacy that was literally an April Fool's joke for us there's no way
anyone's actually I mean our inbox booths private work pods are the perfect solution to office noise and distractions doesn't look sold no I like it that is a little pricier than some solutions we've looked into we actually need some of these but I can't fault the build quality the features or the overall Vibe is this for two people or four it feels like it'd be an extremely cozy four it'd be a cozy four but it for sure confirms two people this is actually their Tuesday Booth I get
it so what would they call the four one fours day oh I was going to go with four skin we should remove this and that sorry you know what else we should remove forkin the sound anybody else  conversation and the only that I gu going to be the we can hear each other just fine other than it being a little echoey thanks to this big glass panel here it definitely gets stuffy fast if you don't have the fan on how much did we spend on all this  "$114,000 more importantly the booth was"
actually sent to us are we going to buy some well if you use our affiliate code down below they'll knock the price off  some who put you up to that I'm not not even kidding that's the contract we signed thanks Josh oh what is this a docking station oh it's so cute micro SD SD power okay you got some usba USBC all the usba and ethernet at the back and wow triple monitor support okay okay but hold on hold on hold on that was a chunker of a power brick uh it makes sense if you've got 60 watts of USB PD
plus being able to power everything else that's connected to it and I love that they've matched the aesthetic how cool is that we're actually going to build a full desk setup in here for you that's what it's meant for right so starting with the docking station then we'll add some monitors later on oh sick oh it has a little cute calendar and clock I love this thing this is great it had a ad just on Instagram that led us to temu I think they also have like an official website you can go to but this is where
we purchased it from I can't promise it isn't stealing your data but I can promise you it's adorable if you had to guess the price on this what would you put it at I don't know 70 bucks it's 220 Canadian so it's about 150ish us it is a docking station docking stations get expensive yeah it just feels like a novelty one you can change the colors you have black blue and red whoa okay that's pretty cool swipe to the side they even totally just used the Apple logo oh no way which I don't know if they can
get away with technically 3x 4K displays though that's actually going to come handy cuz we bought some screens okay let's keep going with the setup then yeah jow what was the name of this company sure JSA they made the docking station that was used in Sam's upgrade and we actually like complemented the quality and fit and finish of it yeah well apparently they make these flip go Duo monitors and they sent us both of these when we asked for one so we get to pick now which one do you want cool I
want this one cool oh wow that is like a whole laptop worth a monitor right there good Lord built-in USB hub though that's pretty handy micro HDMI in display port in though that's cool button for changing the orientation so just bip bip is there a battery like does it just power on it powers on by one of the USBC cables oh but there's no battery no oh do they have any ideas for how you're supposed to mount this I'm so glad you asked they also sell stands for them oh okay but it doesn't come with any way of
actually mounting this to anything no it comes you have to buy the stand well wait what about this thing positioning of the magnetic suction bracket yeah that's what's in here what seriously are you you're not are you not me messing with me right now like there's absolutely like this doesn't hold it in any meaningful way not that I could figure it out it has to let me pull up the website there's no way it just sits like that you know sometimes not everything needs a solution you ever think about that
no oh my God that magnet is what holds it yeah it's pretty strong okay once you get it lined up it's actually pretty oh yeah it goes on there pretty okay I mean it's a little scary yeah trusting your life on that is okay well your monitor's life anyway if you had to guess the price I keep getting everything wrong $400 $600 dang it I hope this this stand isn't more than like 30 bucks it's 40 well that's within range uh okay boom just like that hold on I'm switching the orientation overall this
would be a huge productivity booster and it would be pretty much like carrying around two laptops with the way that it folds down the stand leaves a lot to be desired though okay what's next there's one more thing in here for your setup oh cuz you don't want to be typing on your keyboard and mouse oh you threw it right at my junk it's good quality I bought them from an M okay we've got the block triple mode connection mechanical keyboard back to Classics yes by the company low fre you and I've also got
this triple mode wireless touch mouse what's a touch mouse you'll see oh yeah that's it that's kind of stupid they make some extremely bold claims for this bad boy replaceable PBT key caps sure if you can find that key profile again also improve comfort and  that X exad doubt this is cool though magnetic dongle holder oh is that would that is so cool oh I was trying to figure out what it was on the keyboard dude sick I like the style of the keyboard you know what sure they might probably spend too much of
their product development Budget on Facebook ads but they also spent a lot on design yeah it looks pretty good right she actually thoughts not bad but the question is uh how much did she thck me do you want to guess sure I'll guess keyboards I should oh 80 bucks 170 no mouse I don't know it's pretty stylish 70 bang on now for something that's not part of our work setup this this retropixel Pro tiny computer it's powered by an RK 3326 quadcore arm CPU and it features and it's gone Emily sden
from our editing team sent this ad over to procurement procurement clicked on the link and the site was no longer working and this right here is the biggest reason that this video took so long to take because we would go to purchase items from obvious drop shippers or scammers and they had already pulled the rug so guys please take an extra 30 to look over items before handing over your payment information since you never know what people are on the other end of these companies I actually almost gave my
credit card to someone who had um they were like cheaper versions of those uh electronic water blasters oh yeah and they were listed for like $27 and I was like I've never heard of this site before and I googled are they a ripoff and it was like pages and pages and pages of negative reviews so 30 seconds watch out okay what did we actually get next then another temu special a 20 in one cleaner without looking at the Box  20 there's one stop it just comes apart I don't know if a Sim removal tool counts as a
cleaning device and the same goes for a key switch puller and a key cap puller you missed one on in there I missed something yeah the lid itself what this yeah wipe a screen with it you know I'm not a screen but thank you I would not wipe a screen with this well you're at keep going oh oh little Spritz bottle yeah that's pretty cool little air puffer yep it it moves air tampon airpod case cleaner right that makes sense Leal brush okay I'm bored yeah there's a lot of them yeah
that's that's the gist of it how much do you think it was this has got to be 10 bucks it was five bucks yeah it's fitting that your mic battery just died we bought a battery tester hey they don't work for rechargeables they don't no oh rechargeables run in a different voltage range than alkalines oh well do you want to test it make sure sure I mean it works it works it's it it was $4.20 hey it's a good battery it's a good battery I hope so I just grabed it from the Shelf these things are a dime a
dozen though and I've seen much better form factors than this stupid system so if you paid more than like six bucks for it than you got ripped off I'm glad we didn't get ripped off this one I think we did though take a look at this one smart light sound machine EX look at the size of it in his hand well it's this is a completely different thing yep what the the F that's a completely different product correct that one has a speaker in the front this one the speaker down here they the play
button is backwards what the heck it's also like four times bigger in the video he's holding it wireless phone charging though I'm sure that won't light on fire  oh wow that quality speaker though would you like to listen to some  much oh that's my phone speaker  while a I think we get the point it sounds like garbage yeah we don't know maybe it's got a hidden speaker okay we can move on feel how light it is like our second last not this again this is no longer available on temu is it gone because of how
dangerous it is there's literally a warning right on it that's like laser class one and then it just beams it into this refractive Dome and sends it fraking everywhere how you supposed to not have a child or a pet or an adult look into this thing it has speakers though and it came with the remote what does the microphone button do I don't know this remote feels like there's nothing inside it it is lighter than the battery tester all right you ready no did just stop I was going to check to make sure
it's turned on what is that wow wow that was the G button here's R here's B here's W that's whsh yeah close hello check check check check hello switches between red and okay that's the mic oh it's music mode bluetooth is off I hope I'm not connecting to someone's headphones right now youo is connected oh that was it that's me I'm not going  logs this sounds so bad no like you're imagine you put that in your you know six-year-old kid's room they're vibing okay imagine this for a second though 
Andy literally world's better if I'm going to need the phone and I'm going to need to be in Bluetooth range I might as well just play it off the phone it's not the same Vibe though the thing I connected to is this what oh you got it working I connected to the  apparently it's even worse the price uh 10 bucks you'll be happy it's only eight okay our last temo item industrial endoscope yeah does it scope your end it can actually oh wow yep that's aij just knows you can flip it upside down so
that's pretty useful black and white versus not black and white depending on what you're trying to make out that could actually be pretty useful no recording unfortunately that's a bummer yeah USBC charging you know what pretty cool if this was less than let's say 50 bucks I'd say it could be useful at least this one at this length was $54 us yeah you know what I like it thanks TAMU that endoscope kicks off the camera gear category you got an advertisement for the opal tadpole a tiny webcam with a
clip wait these are the guys that Marquez invested in correct okay what's the pitch it's the world's smallest webcam of this class okay Sony sensor yes correct the cable doesn't open the whole way because I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you I guess yeah I was confused by that I don't really get it either oh and I guess we get to try it now yeah let's test it it's better than what we had it's better than my laptop for sure you want to guess the price oh God it's probably like $150 or something bang on
really yeah and you can get a carrying case which will bring it to 168 yeah I wouldn't spend that kind of money on this this next item I think is a scam is this supposed to change your phone to like a wide-angle lens or something oh yeah yeah it's for a camera we bought the Sony e-mount variant wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait so this just goes like straight onto your C this is a lens correct this is just like crazy glued together correct this is  $50 who would be stupid enough to buy
this do you want to try it yeah I do actually could they have at least invested in a decent 3D printer okay here we'll go with our LTT desk pad Northern Lights design very nice beautiful oh my God this it feels so wrong what the hell I got to say this like works better than I thought it would that's not really a sales pitch no no no no no yeah no manufactured ewaste for sure apparently we're shooting the next one on that lens now so way to go look at what you've done Elijah perfect this
is what we were shooting on a that's garbage that cost money oh this looks better it shut up it's actually a good thing you mentioned that it's better cuz this device promises to help you take your photos better the intelligent camera assistant camera body meet camera brain dude was this a Kickstarter way back in the day correct I think I remember this thing it's compatible with a certain list of cameras you basically clip it onto the top it'll calibrate your environment and then help adjust
your settings on your camera to help you take a better photo okay so it's auto mode correct have we had our camera guys look at this at all and like discuss it cuz surely it wouldn't still exist after all this time if it was completely useless I think their main target is going to be amateur photographers right they're not going to be targeting someone who knows their camera inside and out so I think that's probably why they still exist they're also one of the products that uh is
always on sale you know it's marked at 430 and it's $130 off so we paid $300 for it shut up yeah we got three of them why well cuz I thought if they work you know we they come we didn't there's another one the other one's at the studio why did you buy more well cuz if they work but what if they don't okay stop but what are you not telling me they sent it to us I just wanted to scare you okay well how do we try it this camera is one of the compatible ones okay so let's plug 
so hitting the take photo button what it'll do is you should notice some settings adjust after I hit the button yeah hit it wa look at that wa jeez it even hit the shutter yeah it takes the photo fully for you wow that's pretty cool okay I took a picture now I'm going to try now you're going to optimize it um I definitely saw some settings change I mean it didn't change that much it went with a faster shutter speed speed M it did open up the aperture a bit more so you get more of like a
pleasing depth of field effect but the question for me is is that what I wanted because I might have wanted more of the object in Focus so that's debatable the theme of the shoot is dumpster photography I think it definitely helped yeah the only difference is full auto went with a slightly slower shutter speed but the way we're using it assumes a particularly unsophisticated user like I don't know if it's adjusting more than just shutter speed aperture and ISO which like I can do and I'm not exactly
a photography expert yeah Andy described it as spend the $300 on a book and learn how to take a better photo you know what though if most of what you're after was just the remote functionality and the app sa for wildlife photography I could actually see it being pretty useful but as a you know training wheels for camera operation I don't know guys picture this your children won't get off their phone what do you do tell them to get off their phone what if what if they don't
then I use family link and I lock their phone well this product can do that too it is a box that you can plug in and then charge up to four devices okay why are they all lightning you can switch them out okay okay all right but then what happens is you close this yeah using their app you can magnetically lock it with a timer so that hey you know in 2 hours you can go get your product h H you thought I was going to hate on this didn't you yeah but how much do you think it costs oh oh
oh if it was 100 bucks I'd be like you got to pay app developers somehow it's a niche product they probably don't sell that many but this is pretty trendy looking product literature mhm crap it's like $300 isn't it it is 250 us for the Box do you want to know the best part you can't even use it without paying for their subscription no you can charge your devices it will not do any of the timer or locking without a $180 a year subscription Linus does the membership cover my
entire family I should sure as hell hope so we'll charge five phones at once I think there is more like I only see four slots oh yeah how will it charge five phones that's just an outright lie great concept the price is way off yeah $100 onetime fee sure if you're this desperate I'll take $100 a Year from you to hold on to your phone and give it back to you when you want it okay so hold on to this phone okay okay no no you don't need the Box no I I still want to use the Box what you don't you paid
for the box I'm just the subscription all right here thank you okay now give me my phone no you have to wait nope give me the phone now no I need the ad I need the admin passw you don't have the credit card what's the password I don't remember sucks to be you I have a product that doesn't require a subscription the photo stick 2.0 oneclick photo backup you plug it in and  exe uh can we go ask Luke if we can test this really quick sure okay you know with a name like this I got to wonder
what kind of pictures it backs up Luke's not here so we're going to talk to Sean instead um we would like to use the photo stick the instructions are to double click on the photo stick windows.exe and it will back up our photos uh no cool all right see you later one of the selling features it works with Windows 7 40 bucks it's $60 for a 32 gig you're not backing up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay on to our last product this is the bedjet uh-huh it's basically an air conditioner SL heater
for your bed that sounds amazing yeah do you want to give it a try I do okay wow that's something it's a white noise generator too yeah bonus it does heating and Cooling and that this sheet is only the single Inlet but you can actually get a sheet from them that'll do like a his and her side so you can have one side that's hotter one side that's colder you would need a second machine yeah I see that yes so it doesn't do heating and cooling it does heating or cooling yes where is the air going so it actually
goes between the two layers of the sheets oh okay so this is my warmed bed good night sweet prince not dying it does look like it how does it feel though can you tell it's warmer oh yeah okay oh yeah no it's it's great it's warm well let's cool it now I don't expect it to be as sophisticated as something like you know eight sleep with their subscription nonsense yeah um but I also expect it to be a lower price correct I'm going to say 300 bucks it's 600 but it's one of those products that
is always on sale so we actually got it for 430 okay you could Jank together something on your own for a lot less than that or you could just not yeah do you need a subscription nope okay oh that's interesting it definitely cools starting at the bottom and that whoa she's she's flowing wait did no our AC just kicked in it's pointed right at me Andy the Cold's definitely coming from inside the sheets as well but I don't know if it's cold so much as it's like it didn't warm up you know like when you
get into the bed and the sheets are kind of cool like it feels kind of like that I think that's the whole point though I don't think it's necessarily supposed to be like an air condition replacement do you think this could help some people cuz I don't think it's actually a bad product no yeah seems Seems prra Alex actually wanted it he was considering buying it before we did it for this video so he's asking if it can go in the Christmas party pile sure okay can we buy it
