while I could water cool my computer with one of these when I found out that a local data center was just throwing away this UNIF flare inro acrc 100 server cooler I knew what had to be done we're at 500 WS 995 Watts oh my God look at this it broke it just says zero Watts I didn't know how complicated it was going to be something tells me that a G14 PC water cooling fitting isn't going to exactly just thread into this bad boy but hey that's what friends are for right so let's drill into
this and hope that we don't screw anything up oh just like I screwed up that segue to our sponsor cleaning the house can be a dangerous exercise last I used Robot Rock sa Max VR Tru which vacuums them up only one go he loves to clean so much it even clean itself good  wow look at this thing you can fit so much Radiator in this bad boy but the way that they're using it is not the way that you would expect this is a chilled water modular air conditioning unit that's right it is intended to cool the
air in the data center rather than cooling the servers directly it's available in either a half rack that's the one we're looking at here or a full rack model and this older one disc  "$6,500 and if you look there's all kinds" of indicators that this is not your regular water cooling system for one thing it's got these drip trays all over the place and this insulation that seems to indicate that they are expecting this to collect a lot of condensation from the ambient air that's because this
water in Supply pipe here is meant to take coolant that's as low as 7Â° C it's an air conditioner in the sense that it takes the hot air that is blown out of the servers on either side of it sucks it into the back pulls it through this radiator that's got super chilly water running through it and then blows it back out the front cooled to a reasonable temperature where it can be recycled into those server racks next to it the only problem is how do you get the water so cold
there are a number of solutions to that you can use good old-fashioned Refrigeration evaporative cooling here in Canada we just Plum directly into the nearest Glacier but realistically we have a different goal and we're not going to worry about any of that wow D these ever look like finger jompers the problem is our cable is just so short but it's got all the slack yeah what are they doing causing me nothing but Discord right now I didn't get that joke oh slack Discord a got you what plug
into oh wow she just fires up like that it feels great that does feel great oh there we go hey inro okay cool check this out check this out 530 L per second that's ply have password no oh this is why we have to look up resetting the password I see well I guess we're going to need to rip this off wear eye   hey see you later buddy look at that take that lockpicking lawyer I'm kidding we have no beef great channel in order to reset the password we're going to need this seral to usba
to USBC because modern laptops JK I use a framework I can totally use usba let's go boom investment disclosure also back here we've got some of the enterpris nature of this on full display we've got Network control and redundant power supplies press the reset button on the P back of the electrical panel okay immediately press enter repeatedly if necessary to display the   username it's a me Mario no no please choose a regular I'm working on it I I think I pressed enter
a lot of times and it's really confused boom we're in the main frame is hacked boys username what no I'm going to go admin admin that's great enter new administrator authentication phrase admin Tech tips oh my God I didn't successfully do it F do you want me to go get shot no no it's fine it's fine it's done bad authentication phrase I can't just put admin as the authentication phrase hey that's a good thing I know but I I don't care right now you know minimum 15 characters this is really 
can I just set it to full speed yeah try fan speed control man manual let's go oh here we  shorts 1200 l a second and you want to replace these fans look at how I could barely hear you talking I'm we're yelling yeah I'm right next to you 134 like almost 14 1400 L that's the power of the whatever the this thing ISC 100 now of course it's not going to do basically anything with the side panels off these fans are going to pull the air from the point of least resistance which is right here so you
got to put the side panels on you want it nice and sealed up here in fact I'm willing to bet that is one of the reasons these panels have this foam on the inside of them we've got caps on the secondary Supply and return right yeah so we don't got to deal with anything down there all we've got to deal with is this Supply and this return neither of which appears to be plumbed with any kind of threading standard that Justin was able to identify thankfully we've got this I've never brazed before oh sure
that makes sense fun fact I've also never used a sawall before it's called a sawall cuz it saws all are you even trying this week that joke's actually from a Nicholas Cage movie that's not even a joke that's just why it's called that what's our level of concern about the metal shavings and the power supplies down there it's covered  it hey uh Justin do you mind just putting a hand on this okay I actually don't want your hand right there there   these man how did I do that so smoothly
the first time okay Justin you're up okay I'm trusting you don't take out my hands whoo whoa you should really hold them further away no I'm good I'm good he's he's cutting away from my hands  [Applause] all right I feel less bad you had a bit of trouble getting it started too what's next we got some oh sick dang man that looks professional check this out Justin made G14 threaded endcap things that I guess we got at Home Depot or something what do I put these on though well on
one of these but you're going to have to braze the other end on to those copper pipes first  thiso all right so what you want to do is just it up until it starts to discolor get it nice and even and then push the solder into the joint oh yeah  yeah oh yeah no no that's good that's supposed to happen oh God oh God oh God I mean yeah what's it even dripping on couldn't be that harmful looks great well very generous thank you but it looks on there okay I may not have put quite enough
Teflon tape on this but I guess we're about to find out now it should just be like hooking it up to a computer regularly okay you know you've done that lots of times yeah what what is this uh this is for the pump is for these Edge these are the ones you want oh right we should show you our pump and uh okay sure so that kind of makes sense because with the size of the tubing and the volume of water that you're expecting to move through a system like this you need a ser ious pumping
solution and these things because they have no idea what your deployment is going to look like don't have any pumping of their own wait so all that power supply is just for those fans man look at them though look at these fans now how Yu tastic are we expecting the water in this thing to be they should have been serviced regularly yeah but I think we all see the state of the inside of this with rust andw everywhere that's the inside of this not the inside of the pipes we'll see how bad the rat is so
maybe for the start we don't actually put it through the computer we just circulate it and see what we get yeah that sounds good are the O-rings going to seal against this kind of rough thing oh we're going to use a 2 and2 mm hex key which is on there already turn the float control actuator to the fully open position and what's the fully open position the other way oh God ah maybe if someone hadn't gotten solder all over it oh God oh God she's turning on her own the screwdriver is going nice open
the two-way supply valve and the two-way bypass shut off valve okay using a two and a half that's probably these guys so that's in a weird not open or closed state so open it there you go all right here we go pumpy let's turn our nice Prime pum Merson here there we go look at that that's pretty clean actually yeah right they did service it yeah you're not wrong so we'll get the air bubbles out let it go for a little while and then hook it up to a computer freaking a man okay now before before we do that I
want to play around with these valves a little bit cuz I don't know I it's not that I don't believe you it's just that I think you're fullish me right now it's working so right but then I do this and it slows to a trickle and stops okay all right all right so that was open look we're we're learning okay we're learning together okay what's this boy what's this boy do this is a bypass to bypass the radiators there's no valve for the radiators but if for whatever reason you wanted to not run through the rack
okay then you can bypass it here but we want this closed because we don't want it going straight from water in to water out there you go yeah okay that makes sense everything makes sense by the way it's leaking I think I understand why nobody else wanted them but boy do I ever want them this is awesome hey look at that magnetic Cable Management let's go LTT store.com we're just we're just Plumbing it up to the top of the why not in this machine we've got a thread Ripper Pro $79.95 WX this is a 96 core
processor that'll suck back I think somewhere in the neighborhood of like freaking 400 watts or something stupid like that and and we've got an RTX 4090 one of a little it bitty cute ones a more practical deployment for us since we're not going to have water blocked servers like this machine right here would be to just take the hot air in the server room use that hot air to heat up water then carry that air somewhere else and then dissipate the heat but for the purposes of just kind of showing you
guys that it does work this will do us nicely do we have any zip ties mags oh my God that would totally maybe work Andrew so he there you go all right good enough magnets yeah just let's let's see let's see let it cook oh my God cook nothing it's running at 44Â° 42Â° so we were going to go with 14900 K originally yeah but Jake figured that the uh IHS would be too small that's not going to tell us the full story because realistically something like this is about the sheer volume of heat that it
can move right it's not about how well can it deal with a concentrated heat Source like this where to your point just the size of the Dy and the bottleneck of moving that heat away through the IHS is going to have more of an impact than the actual like cooling capacity of this giant unit here but in terms of if we were to hook like half a dozen computers up to this thing it should conceivably be able to do it whole office water cooling anyone did I mention already that we 
them now that this is running the only reasonable way to Benchmark it is to I don't know run it for an extremely long  if sorry I'm running 92 threads at Prime 95 this is amazing um and see if it heats up so we've got our little temperature graph on F Mark here that's at a solid 46 it's gone up 2Â° and I haven't even turned the fans on yet I have a feeling this is just going to be dead flat but let's go ahead we're going to get it fired up and it's quitting time so I'll see you guys on the
tomorrow and good morning it's been about 14 hours and things are looking real good CPU usage still 100% from Prime 95 ferm Mark's doing this weird thing where it's kind of hitching for a long time sometimes but uh it's still using 93 to 99% power and you can see if I move the window around the the the render works properly so I don't know what the heck it's doing but really that's not what we care about we're looking at temps here we've reached a maximum of 56Â° which means with one system on here
we are still looking at coolant temperatures that are barely lukewarm to the touch that is fantastic water tastic the last thing I want to check is CPU temperatures which I'm expecting to be oh a little higher than this WOW 40Â° I mean sure these thread Ripper chips yeah they kick out a lot of power but they're so big that like I was talking about before the size of the die isn't as much of a heat transfer bottleneck that is H that is fantastic H what kind of power is it drawing woo 350 Watts I was out
yesterday when they were filming this crazy thing and being the person that sourced them I had to see it for myself except I found out that lonus didn't bother turning PBO on and I'm like the thread rippers could draw like a th000 Watts by clicking one button in the buos so we did that I think we start with cine yeah it's done it's drawing 800 watts but let's try 2024 just for reference with PBO on on this CPU it idles at 150 watts doing nothing 450 600 600 what I don't know how optimized this is
May maybe it doesn't use like well okay I mean it's running at 4.64 GHz on every single core it's "estimating like an 8,000 Point score in" 2024 for reference a 32 core second gen "thread Ripper is 1,200" points this is the real test Prime 95 smallest fft is hyperthreaded this has ABX 512 which means it is going to it is going to hurt we're at 500 wats 9 95 Watts oh my God look at this it broke it just say zero watts in the Bios we had set the enhancement to limit it to 90Â°
so once it gets to that point it kind of starts throttling down a bit not to say that 1100 watts is really throttling down a bit but this is just actually ridiculous it's still not running at Peak airf flow we're definitely running into a situation where we're just limited by the thermal transfer Block in the IHS but it's uh the inlet temperature is 20.7 De so we're not even like above ambient really at all and the fans are only running at it's like 900 L per second through this thing and it can
do 1400 right so this is too much I don't know how many thread riers we' need to hook up to like make this hurt but I imagine it's a lot in conclusion then big fans very very effective for cooling see you at the next tech tip oh but not before I get some help with this mess from our sponsor oh no let's suck with Rob Rock whether it's that friend who eats with their mouth open or who don't take the shoes off sa mxv rra can handle all the mask without ruining your friendship
hair crumbs or mystery powder nothing is Left Behind after a party thanks to it "hyper Force system with 10,000 pascals" of suction power it can also mff with 60Â° hot water and a detergent dispens automatically at the only one deck Roo rock is ranking number one for robotic vacuum sales worldwide and comes with a 5-year warranty robor Rock S8 Max V Ultra will be available on April 22nd we have the link below if you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the one where we did a precursor to what this
will become in my basement setting up radiators inside and outside to move heat out of the building
