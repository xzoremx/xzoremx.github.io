maybe you missed it but several months ago Asus released the best RTX 490 ever the Rog Matrix this represents the Pinnacle of asus's manufacturing capabilities with higher clock speeds than any other 490 liquid metal on the GPU Die For maximum cooling performance and a 360 mm radiator all-in-one water cooler built right in the only problem  "$3,200 that is twice the price of the" founders Edition card Republic of Gamers more like Republic of out of touch I bet you could take that $1600 premium and
put it towards building your own custom loop I mean you could probably even pay yourself a fair wage for the research and building the darn thing oh you're talking to me yeah I bet you could buy a regular RTX 490 and all of that stuff and still have cash to spare uh okay but um where will I get  here life can suck sometimes but with the right attitude and tools you can fix it I'm talking about this poor laptop fix what you can this back to school season with our sponsor iFixit you may
fail your tests but don't fail your laptop on sale now at ifixit.com let's lay out some ground rules Adam's budget has to go towards a 4090 of his choosing planning and purchasing all components for a water cooling Loop and paying himself to assemble it he's going to be paid the median wage of a Geek Squad repair agent which according to glass door is $21.63 per hour ready go I quickly got to researching using resources from J2 cents and Reddit and I figured I have enough budget that I can Splurge big
time so not only am I going to cool my GPU I'm also going to cool my CPU and get an Ultra Premium Water block for both of them and to deal with all that heat I'm hoping a thick 400 0 mm rad will do the trick I spent 90 minutes and a lot of money during my shopping spree and I think I did a pretty good job but let's see what lonus thinks all right let me see there's definitely some stuff that stands out immediately as not a great value however when you look at what we're
comparing it to I guess I can forgive it before we get into those details though I want to see if he outright missed anything that's going to cost him a penalty once he's assembling the system cooling blocks for a CPU and GPU check check a pump and Reservoir to make it simpler to fill the loop and move fluid around a big radiator with some fans to go on it I don't know if these are the ones I would have chosen but hey at least he's got them along with a high performance phase change thermal pad
from LTT store and some tubing and some fittings both of which raise a couple of questions about his research for me for starters this is his case and while the fantex nv7 is both reasonably priced and attractive what it isn't is is small and Adam has only purchased 9.8 ft of this XT softline mesh sleeved tubing from Corsair it should cover the distance between all of his plummed up components but when you go with a thin walled tubing like this one the loop layout matters a lot if you want to avoid Kinks
and this length doesn't leave him a ton of room for error as for his fittings it's never a bad idea to buy ones that are explicitly compatible with the tubing that you bought from the exact same vender and these XF series compressions look pretty nice with recessed O-rings and a pretty pleasing overall finish the only thing I'd critique here is that he could have saved probably 20 or $30 by going with fittings from someone like bixy he also paid a butt ton of money for this 4090
water block probably about double what I would have spent but who knows maybe it's oh okay it's very very pretty and In fairness to Adam even these exess purchases above and beyond buying an RTX 490 have put him nowhere near the cost of the Rog Matrix Platinum I mean he's still got 7 hours of budget left to pay himself to build it maybe he shouldn't have sprung for a $200 CPU block overall though not exactly how I would have done it these Quantum surface radiators from Ek have a
very dense fin Arrangement and I see nothing to indicate that these thermal take fans have particularly High static pressure to take advantage vage of that but it should still offer good performance for both his GPU and his CPU and I don't see any other things here that promised to be a major showstopper and he passed one of the biggest stumbling blocks when he bought a block that was explicitly compatible with his   go so now we're going to mount our water block I got this cool water block from
Ek uh I bought it cuz it looked cool I could have gotten something that was like literally half the price and still would have been a great performant water block but I was so confident about my budget that I felt that we could do this anyways we got our PTM 7950 you know there is a video on LTT store.com of the best way to put this stuff on and I have not watched it a water block on um so here is our tough gaming 4090 while the Rog Matrix Platinum is based on the stricks
platform by Asus I figure that if it only gets like an extra 6% performance I might be able to squeeze an extra performance out of their tough series if I get lucky but now I have to take off all of this cooler to put it into this the Optimus water cooling I don't know what the exact model is but holy cow it's heavy these guys are from like Chicago or something they're a pretty small company and and apparently this is one of the best water blocks on the market do you know how I do you know how
I know that I Googled best 490 water block and everyone said it was this I was just thinking wow I wish I had a way to organize my screws but then I remembered that we have these handy dandy mod mats that are going to be coming soon to LTT store.com that are the perfect thing for what I am doing this is not going to wors my budget okay I know I might look like the kind of guy you could take home to your mama but I'm a bad boy I avoid the warranty fun fact about these stickers manufacturers put
them on devices to intimidate you and make you feel like you're not allowed to Tinker with devices you own but these warranty void stickers are not enforcable by law anywhere in America so if a company's refusing to give you service you can always you know complain to the FTC about it because it's complete BS you bought the thing you should be allowed to service it for the case we got this big old fantex nv7 it's massive it's Shen it's uh got support for a 480 mm rad because
that's what I went with cuz it seemed like it was the best way to get a lot of radiator for a little bit of budget as well as it lowered the amount of fittings I needed which at fittings my God they eat into your budget but I am a little worried cuz it looks like my motherboard might not fit yeah so eatx motherboard is a problem let's see if we can take this little thing out and maybe we will be saved so while this computer has this really cool set of LEDs that are actually totally
cableless that line the motherboard tray um we might not be able to use at least one of them but the good news is that I think that means our motherboard fits in hey look at that however we do need to consider that our radiator is going here I think hm or does this go along the top nope one of these things is not like  bigger it's so close if it's if if we mounted it here it fits we doed an hour and change to compensate for the $15 extra dollar for the two radiators and
for the um Tri to the store and now it went from being like yeah we got enough time to being like okay this is going to be kind of tight let's figure out our pump mount we got the xd5 RGB Elite LCD from Corsair it's a pump res combo and uh that's just that was just to simplify the number of components it's also got a cool scream but right now it kind of looks like it's screaming I probably won't be spending a ton of time doing any cable management because uh boy howdy I don't have a ton 
yeah it's tubing time we got both of our radiators mounted one at the top one at the bottom and I think we are going to be just peachy I use soft tubing cuz I don't hate myself and I didn't want to do hard tubing and I needed this to be possible also the Rog Matrix it doesn't use hard tubing it uses soft tubing so yeah I'm pretty sure you just kind of like shove it on there and then these are compression fittings so what they do is that uh when you screw them on they tighten the edge of they they have these
little prongs and then they tighten around that and then that gets your tube nice and tight and sealed and then it don't leak hopefully so that going to be too tight of a bend for this tubing I guess I can go to the top one and then that can go up and that prevents the fear of kinking though I have no fears  Kinks my phone number is 60 this isn't exactly a precise way of measuring things but I figure it's is good enough right this got to go a little bit longer than   there maybe it won't matter when I fill
it with water I don't know man damn look at this beauty what the heck is this tube did he decide to buy this Oh I thought this was like sleeving oh oh God this is terrible dude look feel this oh yeah it's actually awful like but like put your hand right here like she's done but yeah that's just not going to work yeah yeah it's also an interesting mix and match of Brands here we got some EK we got some Corsair we got some Optimus these blocks are super nice that's a really
expensive pump that's the fanciest pump I've ever seen But then why this tuing is this Corsair these are Corsair fittings too these are ugly like I these everything about this build looks great except these fittings in tubes does he have any 90Â° oh there's there's not a chance that this fitting right here is going to work out in any way yeah like he could make this CPU to GPU Line work it's just too long right now but you know you go like  and it's the worst tubing I've ever seen
all I got to say is good luck man because I don't have a lot of extra tubing I need to make sure that every time I make a cut I can only go this cut only needs to be shortened so I always want to have a little bit extra because if I screw up a if I screw up a cut and it's too short I lose like this whole length it's supposed to like maybe losing like centimeter or half an inch or something you know oh I need to change this so This top thing this needs to go here this is the outlet Port this
needs to go to the  cut holy crap I think we're done okay now we just got to turn it on make sure everything's working and then we're going to start filling with water this is amazing an hour and 15 minutes to go little did Adam know his journey was far from over I think we're screwed boys turns out that this pump doesn't just use you USB power it also requires to be connected to a Corsair IQ Link Box that of course they don't include which means I have to make a trip to the store if I want this
pump to work it doesn't matter if you don't care about any of the smart features you can't just run the pump off of the USB header you have to connect it to a Corsair IQ link I should have expected Corsair to pull this kind of in my defense Corsair does a great job of not telling you anywhere on the main page on their website you actually have to go into the text specs I believe and then go no nothing here that says it's required um if I go to guides maybe so I'd have to look at I'd have to review
the manual they also do a great job of not showing it to you on the box except for this tiny little thing that says that IQ link is required it costs  me and it's not even like we can return something like we did with the radiator I just have to spend $60  left it's now counting upwards to demonstrate how much time I'm wasting and how much in debt I will be at the end of this okay we have our funnel and our distilled water and this is going to be a pain in the to pour isn't it this
is kind of terrifying do you see any drips anywhere so what's wrong here like why isn't basically what's happening is that there's air in the tubes already and that would be preventing the water from going so maybe if I give it a little bit  tip it's flowing in a circle you can see it coming down the inlet yeah you see that no drips no drips let's do this we're finally up and running and I'm running combuster and cinn bench at the same time and I am actually blown away I was expecting
temperatures to not be as good as they are but running cinebench 2024 we're at like 70Â° on the CPU 80Â° on the hottest core and then on the GPU we're running combuster at 4K 50Â° C we have so much room to crank this thing up another notch I really excited I didn't think it would go this well we also haven't even done our Heating and Cooling Cycles which benefits PTM 7950 so it could get even better we could get even cooler than what we have right now you know what I kind of get it I kind of get why people
water cool this is so cool seeing people get it it's so not worth the money so not worth the money and this look on his face right now it goes the other way when it leaks and you might look at the timer back there and you'll notice that it's counting uh up we went over budget oh no but we were really really close and I'm mostly blaming Corsair tell me about that so you buy their pump right you do a nice do yeah I mean I bought their pump pretty expensive pump it's very fancy um it doesn't run at all
without also buying a sold separately IQ link Hub I also I saw the braided exterior tubing that you bought and I was like that seems like it'd be a really cool look but I have concern about cutting it cleanly and then it's still looking good where you tighten the collars on the compress yeah it looks like is when you go here looks great but when you get right up to the compression fittings you can see like this one I had to do a few times I can see that and it's it's already worn the reason why
these aren't on all these fans connect to these Pogo pins and this fitting right here interferes with this getting a proper contact to actually send the signal they should all run I just have to flip I just have turned them all the way over here yeah why did you choose thermal take fans um because I wanted RGB okay and I I didn't want to spend too much money on RGB I see I got six of these for half the price of three course air fans yep that's fair enough yeah if you had both of these RADS actually running
you'd have plenty of radiator right now and you would be getting better temperatures you can really tell whether your bottleneck is the thermal transfer between the CPU and the block or whether your bottleneck is the dissipation of the heat to the surrounding air by just touching the side of your radiator or just here touch the fins oh yeah that's warm you got to throw some more heat into the air here yeah even your Reservoir feels hot uh-oh what's the coolant temp at we can see 43 oh
that's getting up there yeah So eventually we're going to be getting saturated right and then it just keeps freezing or what happens is the bigger the Delta the bigger the difference in temperature between the surrounding air and the coolant the more efficient the thermal transfer so you reach a point of equilibrium where as the liquid heats up the difference from the ambient air gets greater and the heat transfer gets greater so it flattens out the jibu is still so far below its thermal limits
okay I can explain that the regular form factor for gpus is really not conducive to carrying heat away from them having a a fan blowing down onto a heat sink this thick with these super skinny low static pressure fans FS sucks we've done experiments in the past where we put a tower cooler onto a GPU and they run flipping cool even though the cooler itself weighs less than the gigantic coolers that we put on gpus these days gpus are actually much easier to cool even though they're 400 watts compared
to you know 200 to 300 for a CPU because the dyes are so big you have so much surface area to carry that heat away compared to a CPU like especially on Intel where the die is this big and it's 250 to 300 watts GPU you know 400 watts that big no big deal you spent so much money on your block I had so much money to spend well you could have made up for the budget overrun on that IQ controller and your time overrun if you had just gotten a reasonably priced block that's true but I think it's pretty realistic
like when you did your first water cooling did you get every single part correct well maybe you did no I think that assumption is why people can feel afraid to try new things no I absolutely screwed up my first water cooling setup was a thermal take big water SE it was a piece of sh complete waste of money I thought that what I was buying was an all-in-one setup that could be expanded in the future to you know Go full custom I didn't realize that everything about it was complete garbage and I will say
that the information that's out there to help people start water cooling is so much better it's it's a lot better really great like uh I was referring to a lot of jay2 sense guides because his water cooling guides were awesome it helps it they were great for somebody like me but also had depth that I wasn't even bothering to go into like he's like here's how to Hardline and I was like I'm not not today clearly not so what you want is one of these oh so this is a 38 in ID 5/8 in od what you have is a
3/8 in id/ in od so you can see how much skinnier than that wall is so you want thick wall tubing yeah this is the optimal size but now we need to answer the question does this beat the Rog Matrix I don't think we can answer that question until we answer did you have fun you know since it wasn't any of my own money I had a grand old time but how does my system compare to the incredible power of the Rog Matrix it comes close but not as close as I thought across the games I tested I
found the tough gaming GPU lagged behind about 5 to 10% not being satisfied I decided to put on a quick and dirty overclock I found that I was able to pretty much match the Rog Matrix not bad back to spending the money though I think it doesn't really matter whose money it was because that wasn't the point the point was we're going to spend this money do we spend it on a matrix Rog 49g or do we spend it on ourselves do we spend it on learning something and uh water cooling components that we can
carry forward to Future builds and the experience of diying something so with that in mind who do you think won you know I think it was a lot more fun to water cool and the idea that the Rog Matrix could just crap out and then I'm in the same spot I am now with a GPU that I would have to take apart and water cool anyways I feel like I'm better yes there's going to be maintenance that I have to do I'm going to have to like make sure that my Loop doesn't get clogged and there's a whole
like maybe in the long run if I keep paying my myself at $21 an hour the Rog Matrix might come out on top but this is way more fun way cooler and I can also sell these if I go oh I don't want to water cool anymore I can anything but the radiator pump and Reservoir is not worth much okay you can't sell tubing blocks hold like a quarter of their value if you're lucky on a CPU and basically nothing for GPU with all that in mind then would you  yeah it sounds about right but would you tell the people
