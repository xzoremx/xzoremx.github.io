gaming PC with brand new parts was 4 years ago and if I'm being honest it kind of sucked it wasn't my fault I mean at that budget I could only afford the lowest card in nvidia's GTX gaming lineup and I paired it with the lowest chip in amd's ryzen 3000 Series and even with those compromises we ended up blowing the budget and we were stuck running at low to medium settings at 1080p well no not anymore Intel has changed the lowbudget gaming computer scene with the release of their $250 Arc
b580 thanks to this GPU right here everything that you guys see on the table is brand new hardware and came to  $540 okay okay okay we still broke the budget but we broke it by less and if you're willing to put your trust in some brands that we've never heard of you can get the same performance as us brand new for $500 let's start building but not until after I tell you about our sponsor Greenman gaming they are running their holiday sale until January 10th including big savings like 20% off hell
divers 2 74% off Red Dead 2 ultimate sorry you didn't put redemption in there and I got confused Red Dead Redemption 2 Ultimate Edition and even more award-winning games like God of War Ragnarok rock head to the link in the description to find out more about the sale and stick around because we're going to be browsing Green Man Gaming and having you guys help us pick some games to test after we finish our build let's not waste any time and jump right into our CPU of choice I mean at this
kind of budget tier I'm using the term Choice a little bit Loosely here let's have a look at the CPU that AMD was willing to give us at a price that we can afford the ryzen 5 5500 see here's the thing AMD doesn't really make new ryzen 3 processors for the retail Market anymore we did find some relatively current ones but they were OEM only and not accessible if you're building your own PC the good news is that by choosing an older ryzen 5 we're still getting pretty good bang for our buck we get six cores
12 threads boost clocks to 4.2 GHz and amds somewhat aging but still quite potent zen3 architecture this cost us $79 and thankfully includes a cooler meaning that we don't have to spend Budget on one later as for our motherboard well I'm going to be completely honest with you guys I'll be finding out in real time if this was a good choice we literally fired up PC part picker and sorted low to high the ASRock a520 M hdv micro was still a whopping 70 dollar how is it that even
cheap motherboards are so expensive these days and what are we even getting for features here let's do an unboxing Andy old school unboxing style we get two SATA cables oo an IO Shield oo that's not Halloween why am I doing  no words ah we got an m.2 screw button battery safety notice and we get the board itself I'm expecting this thing to be I actually don't know what I'm expecting am I expecting it to be basic because it's the cheapest motherboard on the market or am I expecting it to be
decent because I paid $80 for it no $70 either way oh you know what actually compared to the budget Boards of my younger years not bad oh oh that's hilarious I bumped the table as I was walking around it I managed to snipe my mute button check that out that right there my friends that's that's skill all right so we get actually what looks like probably either a 3+2 or 4+ one phase vrm design uh which makes sense that it would have some what decent vrms on it given that
it does have socket am4 and technically is compatible with even some pretty high draw chips uh we don't have really any cooling for it but hey at least it's not one of those boards where it has the through holes for cooling but then just doesn't come with a cooler cuz it's a cost down one so you look at it and you're like clearly the idea was to put cooling on here is that because it needed it or because it was aesthetic hard to say we only get two dim slots but that is
pretty normal for a lower-end board and honestly speaking on Modern platforms most of the time I probably wouldn't use all four dim slots anyway we get a couple of pcie slots uh that one is at least full x16 and we get m.2 which is nice to see four SATA ports front USB 3 but no type-c couple USB 2s actually a pretty complete overall package um oh woo IO wow wow you get you get some Modern stuff okay you get a handful of usb3 ports gigabit L uh you know audio jacks but oh man you got some retro stuff on
here too to go along with your HDMI you get DVI DVID specifically you get VGA PS2 for that classic keyboard you're rocking and a couple usb2 ports Frankly Speaking not bad like there's nothing here from a gaming standpoint that I'm looking at going oh no I will simply not be able to uh play my games um yeah I'm as long as it runs stably and doesn't have any serious problems with it I think I'm actually okay with this now Elija you did mention that there were some cheaper boards
correct we actually found some on New Egg for as low as $43 $43 but they okay there's got to be a reason we didn't choose them let's go ahead and uh let's fire up the old the old uh fresh egg the old not aged you know fertilized and hatched egg it's new I I got it yeah I know I'm just trying to be helpful okay components and storage come on come on over here Andy let's find the cheapest the cheapest am4 motherboard we can I want one that's in stock I want one that's sold by New Egg and I want
one that is brand new discount current promotion you what the heck is useful links combo up savings warranty what ises what does warranty mean oh okay oh yeah okay that's cool you can select the warranty thing availability discount dang it where is it I I swear I found this before we started the stream and now I can't find it anymore I want to not refurbished  do you know how to find the I'm pulling it up wait no way Elijah yes sir the cheapest thing they have is $94 now what the heck is going on
here seller are you on Canadian or are you on no I'm on do oh that's that is actually not what I was expecting to happen here it's kind of funny cuz remember the brands of those boards were Brands we didn't recognize and we kind of made a joke in script review that they might vanish in a week uh yeah I guess those Brands vanished within the week no there's no way there's no way we're going to find it we're going to find it do you have a link to the boards uh not from those
cheap ones no uh show more okay oh my goodness look at some of these Brands there's hoen gagger you see this Andy we got hoen gagger brand we've got Ecom hoer I found a we've got mfh zp K oh hold on I think it's this one I think I got it yep that's the same one dude so it's actually gone up in price it's gone up in price the the uh Juan Jui oh I have Andy Andy help me Juan I don't like no I I can't figure out the T all right well it's $56 now for one of these oh dude that would only save us like 15
bucks Hamburg ERS all right well anyway we're going to see if we can end up under 500 bucks either way let's go ahead and get our CPU installed here uh in case we don't find yeah oh it was $43 before okay for those of you who have never seen how to install an am4 CPU this is going to be a treat so you lift up the arm you do the thing oh yeah there you go got that triangle right there delicious Golden Triangle would you eat golden triangles breakfast cereal oh yeah cuz I think I
would I'd be super down for some golden triangles I think that's a pretty I think that's a pretty promising promising cial name uh all right while I get this cooler installed oh my God where did you find this cooler Elijah it was in the stock pile bin it's so dirty  top the one you would get would be much cleaner uh yeah see the thing is a lot of our CPUs are either samples from AMD which don't come with coolers or they're just they've been kicking around long enough that we've lost all the packaging
and coolers and accessories and all that so this is just a random AMD stock cooler yours would probably look a little different uh Dan I think the script calls for me to do or the plan calls for me to do a merch message right about now yeah sure I've got got any merch messages yet should I explain what they are oh yes merch messages are the way to interact with our live live streams all you got to do is go on LTT store.com we got a lot of great stuff that you can check out there right now
uh you can uh back order one of our Precision screwdrivers and bit sets uh you can pick up a regular screwdriver we've got lots of great clothing and apparel t-shirts hoodies all oh oh wait I think the cargo pants are out of stock whatever the point is we've got lots of stuff and just add it to your cart and you'll see a little box to leave a merch message for the stream it'll go to producer Dan who will forward it to me or throw it up on the on the stream or forward it to someone else internally
who can answer your question basically he'll get you an answer sometimes his answer is Frankly Speaking not great it's just whatever he can quickly type up when he's going through the flurry of merch messages but hey at least you get something in return you get acknowledgement from Dan and you get your order in the mail which is better than a lot of sort of throw money at the screen streamer things so that's how merch messages has worked and do you want to show them how a curated one
works sure hey lde does Intel with their xc2 Graphics potentially make the cut and shift things for NVIDIA HQ to make them change their path I don't know I really don't think so I think that if I'm Nvidia right now I am looking at XE as kind of like a an interesting Sideshow um cuz like all you got to do to figure out where nvidia's priorities lie is is follow the money right so I forget the exact mix right now because I haven't looked at it in a little bit and it's not the kind of
thing that keeps me up at night I'm not an Nvidia shareholder but what I can tell you is that there has been a big shift in their revenues between what used to make them a a predominantly gaming oh and also professional visualization company to what they are now which is a predom Min Enterprise uh compute company that has a gaming arm um right now xc2 is not any real threat to Intel's Enterprise Ambitions um and so I just think they're probably looking at this kind of going okay well uh this
is a thing that exists and we're aware of I I doubt they're I doubt it's going to I doubt it's going to result any kind of significant shift in strategy at Nvidia with that said with that said Nvidia has gotten to where they are by being ruthless competitors sometimes when it just like doesn't even matter when they could totally just let someone else have a bone they're like no I will have all the meat and all the bones and all the broth and all the vegetables and everyone else
can have nothing and that's gotten them to where they are today so you never know with Nvidia they might just ignore Ark treat it as a complete non-threat I mean Intel is currently a ship without a captain even how is how can you take them that seriously um but they also might just go hm someone else got a morsel let's crush them you never can tell with those guys this mounting bracket is stuck and I am doing my best to stall for time while I fix it but I having a very difficult
time with it the the arm is stuck too high and it won't come down low enough to grab the to grab the thing Dan do you have another merch message to help me stole with nope oh good oh I just one just came in oh nice wonderful how do you know if you're in love what um what what kind of wait what is that a real merch message that's not you made that up it'll pop up on the screen in a second no way it's from Bradley nobody sent that there it is oh it's real he can't fake that to my knowledge I don't lie
how do you know if you're in love well let me put it this  computer you lock eyes for the the first time she's running Doom maternal actually that's that's a bit of an older a bit of an older game which is fine which is fine it's fine to be into the older computers uh some of them they've uh they've really taken care of themselves and okay sorry this is really this is really coming off the rails here Indiana Indiana Jones in the great circle they uh I don't know I don't know how to
answer that question so instead I'm just going to talk about in this cooler it looks like it will require some disassembly so I've pulled out my LT Precision screwdriver that hopefully oh wait do I even need do I even need to do this oh goodness I don't actually know if I need to take out this screw but I'm committed I believe that you just hook over one of them and then throw down the latch on the other side I don't think you have to remove that if you want to put it on the computer uh no no no no
though the problem is that this is stuck oh it won't come down so no no I'm well aware of how to install an AMD stock cooler you guy thank you for that though I was there when the AMD stock cooler was written Daniel besser jeez goes on the motherboard yeah thank you for that technically the CPU but so the issue is that I need to get in there I've seen this before where it gets jammed don't forget to put the CPU in first so you guys thought you were tuning into a stream where we were going to be doing
a build computer build but instead you're getting the first ever AMD stock cooler tear down on LTT are you kidding me how does this come off I just need to get I just need to get in there uh okay does the fan pop out or what are you even serious right now AMD yep no there's plastic clips that hold the fan in so we're just going to bend those back ever so gently all the while cursing Elijah uh would you like me to get a new cooler out here nope no what I want to do is defeat this one it is now my arch
nemesis okay I will give you two minutes before I call J two minutes yes no way well I don't want to drag this on too long Lin no that's what the people came here to see they came here to see Tech tips I'm glad they did but we have other things to shoot today no no no no this is the only thing we're shooting today okay there we go okay so why is it stuck buddy get get it together here okay what are you stuck on oh okay so here's what happened the arm got up too much somehow someone jammed
it so it's getting stuck on the fins here see that and this plastic tab right here is preventing it from moving over enough to not be stuck on the fins so what we got to do is we just got to kind of force it a little get oh my God get out of the way wait are you even are you even serious right now buddy oh it's not no no no it's much worse it's much worse so this piece right here you see that is supposed to be in between here and instead it's stuck on one of the  happen how does this one
uncp oh yeah there we go oh I could have taken the whole thing off without I'm doing those screws there we go okay there we go so now we can bend this fin back you following Andy y this can go in between there where it's supposed to be okay so it's got that slide so you can stretch it over the thing this can come back on there we go all right take that stock cooler you just got Tech tipped you're fixed well it's not necessarily fixed yet I could still break these little plastic Clips while 
together there we  go that is how it's supposed to work supposed to be able to come down in order to fit over the thing all right Dan you got any more merch messages yeah sure I got a couple here hit me how do you think AMD will compete with the 50 Series and the Intel B series dude I don't know the more I look at it and obviously you know I don't know anything about the performance of 50 Series yet um certainly nothing concrete we don't have cards in hand and even if we did I wouldn't be able to tell you
anything about them um I don't know anything about amd's upcoming cards other than that I could probably speculate that just like with the um PlayStation 5 Pro we're probably going to see improved upscaling um because AMD and Sony seemed to make it very clear that there was some Next Generation Hardware going on there um so upscaling and Ray tracing I would expect to be very much improved in amd's Next Generation products other than that I don't really know anything concrete
about them there is the rumor that AMD is basically not going to bother with the very high end anymore um and they've done that before with some success they've actually done it twice they skipped having high-end cards in their old 3000 Series like Radeon HD 3000 Series so their top end card was the 3870 with that like weird Frankenstein Crossfire card that had two 38 70s on it acting as their Flagship and then they did it again with Polaris so the 500 series uh where the 580 or I think
technically they had a 590 but it was basically a 580 so the 580 was their top end card that time um and they managed to they managed to by focusing on just kind of that um that affordable mainstream price point they managed to gain I don't know a little bit of momentum and they came back with high-end cards but then they still haven't managed to kind of keep that momentum so I don't know what to tell you AMD amd's GPU team just hasn't been able to execute the same way that their
CPU team has been able to and without being embedded in that team I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly why that is I can just tell you that what I'm observing from the outside is that they're having a heck of a time with it and it's it's honestly kind of frustrating from my perspective because in some ways I don't even I don't even think they're doing like a horrible job right it's not like they don't have  just they just somehow don't seem to be  sales all right here we go sorry
I ah there we go I couldn't reach this screw anymore once that was back on there there we go all right Dan hit me again sure why does LTD store not oh wait no I wasn't done yet never mind I lied um so long story short I suspect strongly that AMD is probably I think we're I think based on the rumors we're probably going to see a repeat of that strategy where they kind of Target a mainstream price point and you know For Better or For Worse we're going to we're going to see how that goes and
then as for Intel I think they've I don't think they've given any real indication so far that we're going to see a higher-end Arc so it looks like Intel is going to be gunning for that that value segment that like Esports gamer segment uh as for NVIDIA um I think it's very clear that they're extremely comfortable at the at the top of the roost maybe what we'll see is a future where Nvidia is completely dominant at the top mostly dominant in the mid-range and then AMD and Intel are kind of
fighting it out in the value segment which I think would be really good for gamers because you'd effectively have some competition everywhere other than "the you know, 1500 to $2,000 cards where" I mean realistically if people can afford that then what do they need the competition for anyway apparently they can afford that uh okay are you kidding me I seem to have re broken it all right no no no I will fix it I Dan will give me one more merch message and then I will I will quickly uh I will quickly
fim aate it why does LTD store not have Canadian dollars for pricing for fellow Canadian Shoppers Ah that's a good question the reason is that all of our costs are in US dollars so all of our pricing is effectively derived from our costs in US Dollars meaning that if we had pricing in Canadian dollars it would simply be derived from our USD pricing anyway so it doesn't matter so as much as you can kind of look at the pricing and go oh I could totally afford this If Only They priced in Canadian dollars
that's not how it works the way it would work is our pricing would just be our pricing in US dollars times the exchange rate to Canadian dollars because our costs are in US dollars so pricing in Canadian the one benefit would be that um there's no exchange rate on the credit card which is that is truly a good benefit um however maintaining an entire set of different storefront um for Canadian dollars when the cold hard truth is that Canadian Shoppers are a small small small fraction of our base
is um is not something that our poor accounting department wants to deal with at this current time some someday we may open up multicurrency it is a feature that Shopify enables but it is not a free feature that Shopify enables um I I forget if it's first party or if it's through partners and so it's not um it's not necessarily something that will actually result in lower operating costs or lower pricing because if we're absorbing the cost somewhere either running this feature then it's
either that or you absorb the cost in your credit card fee basically every time we've run the numbers it's pretty much come out in the wash and there's not much point in doing it you know what there is a point in doing continuing this bloody PC build our total is now $150 that is more than I would want to spend having only two parts but that's kind of what we're stuck with because modern generation ryzen 3s don't exist anymore so let's move on and talk about our Ram ah yes this was once again
determined by low to High pricing with a filter for kits that run at at least 3200 megat transfers per second I got to say guys I'm very excited to install the Silicon power x power turbines we've got two 8 gig sticks which I would consider to be pretty minimal for modern gaming this is one of those situations where in an Ideal World I would actually like very much to be able to put 16 gig stick into a system like this and know that I'm going to upgrade to 32 gigs running in dual Channel later but every
time I talk about that these days people get so mad at me so there you go guys there's your two 8 gig sticks running in dual Channel you'll get the full performance today but what it means is if you ever wanted to upgrade from 16 gigs to 32 gigs you're going to have to just Chuck these and put in two 16 gig sticks and I do understand that not running a dual Channel these days is a significant performance penalty um even compared to you know back in the day when many people used to do that just
throw in one stick for now and then assume you're going to throw in a second stick later when Ram got cheaper um but I don't know I think personally I would take the compromise especially because like a big part of H I don't know would I because a big part of the reason that we did it back then too was that RAM prices were kind of always going down whereas now they do mostly always go down but they're especially for ddr4 they're kind of already Rock Bottom so there's no like
oh it's going to get cheaper later so I can upgrade for a fraction of the price so I don't know maybe that's something where for another you know $19 or what we pay for this thing like 18 bucks or something like that right it was very cheap it was like 21 I think yeah so for another 20 bucks maybe it's worth it to go 56 $60 and just get all the ram you need today now storage this one's going to be a bit of a longer story see we almost went full Intel for this build which would have been kind of hilarious
doing a $500 value gaming all Intel build what even timeline am I on um we were thinking maybe we'd use a 1200f CPU but the problem is the cheapest Intel motherboards that we could find from reputable Brands did not support nvme ssds and in present year I just don't feel right putting a SATA SSD into a brand new build if I can avoid it there are situations where SATA ssds make sense say for example if you had already filled your m.2 slot on a motherboard like this yeah by all means add a SATA
SSD but if we're talking your boot Drive you're going to want to use an nvme Drive I mean they're priced pretty much the same these days because most of the cost is just the flash itself self so we did avoid using a SATA SSD and we went with this Patriot p300 PCI gen 3 m.2 it's 512 gigs which I mean I consider a great value considering how much Apple  that Ding yeah or whatever anyway Jokes Aside jokes aside I know that 512 gigs is not the most space in the world in fact I would even go as far as to say
it's not really ideal like it's enough that you can have some smaller games installed and maybe like one top tier game you know like Final Fantasy 16 you pick that up from Green Man Gaming and then a bunch of smaller games and that's basically all  but your mic I it again anyway the point is it's enough that you can at least get started and you can always you know add a hard drive or something like that on one of the for ports later although with that said does this case even have hard
drive okay we'll we'll get to the hard drive conversation later for now let's get this SSD installed and I think we're due to check out some stuff on Greenman and let these guys tell us what games we're going to play later absolutely okay cool well let's get the SSD installed real quick here I'm not monitoring chat are people enjoying the stream or yeah seems very very enjoyable right now there's a lot of people on YouTube oh shoot there's a lot of people watching oh yeah that's the thing about
streaming earlier in a day yeah there almost there's 18 and a half thousand people watching oh hey what's up YouTube all right there we go boom m.2 installation man it's crazy I never know what the right amount of instruction to give these days is like back in the day we could kind of make the assumption that yeah you know most of our viewers are building a computer for the first time or whatever these days man there could be people that have been watching LTT for 15 years so if I'm sitting here
going yeah take your .2 drive and put it in at an angle make sure it's snug put it down two in the screw like those guys are going to get bored but then we also get feedback from people that are building a computer for the first time that are like whoa whoa dude slow down I got no idea what's going on um I almost wonder if there'd be some value to like like creating a for Basics Channel or something like that cuz we we tried to do some some basic stuff on the main  did not fly um the audience like hated
that I mean even the more recent how to build a PC last guide you'll ever need those videos bomb out of the gate and then it's not till YouTube's like like recommended or up next and all their various algorithms pick it up that they start to to get anybody watching them all right are we just going on to Green Man gim do you have screen cap like should I go do this over there we can if you'd like I was planning on you just doing it on your laptop you picking three and then we'll do a poll on float
plane for chat to pick one I get to pick three yeah so let's look through three games that are available on Green Man okay cool yeah we can do that all right cool so uh Andy yeah I guess I'll just turn this around and we'll hope that I don't get any notifications that are highly confidential by switching my teams to do not disturb there we go I dude okay is it just me but like managing my status on chat apps I can't okay okay it's not just me like I literally can't like I see people that
are like they have their status set for their vacation they've got their status set when they go home at the end of the day they got their status set when they're in a meeting they're on a conference call I'm like like guys is it float plane chat is it just me is float plane chat working it is oh a couple people said they agree is it doing the thing oh no I just have to refresh the page okay I'm going to refresh the page cuz I do not have enough brain cycles for that like I have no yeah not just
you okay thank you and yes yes I know that you can have automatic ones but that only helps if you happen to be on your meeting in that app like I don't know and I'm sure you could build automations for like your calendar or whatever but I got to tell you with the number of people that have access my calendar my calendar is a disaster like I would be in do not disturb or like in a meeting or in a shoot all the time and I don't even blame the people that that help me with my calendar like I I I get
it because a lot of the time the the amount of time that I take to do something is unpredictable like for instance I'm doing a gaming stream where I'm building like a basic computer with like six parts we've been streaming for over half an hour and all I've done is put a cooler on a motherboard and CPU and a ram that's that's like nothing I mean look poor Elijah is dying over here he's dying yeah because his boss is going to be like yo Elijah what the heck why is the stream taking so long don't
you don't you make sure that coolers work before you give them to Linus do you have any idea how important Linus is see I I I never have those conversations because I think that's silly I love fixing things but there's there's people there's people that have like performance targets to hit and they're all like Elijah why are you taking so long why why we we need more lus time see you can see is's that to be fair this stream has a very high average viewership right now so I'm good my metrics are hit I'm good
do you have metrics for that like uh I don't think for like we're we're basing things off some views and like how videos perform really so I think in the long term we'll see how this stream does as a vaud oh interesting but as of right now this is a there's a lot of people watching so this is good I know so little about how that stuff works these days now that I don't actually have any direct reports um so I just kind of stand here and do my thing I fix coolers uh what am I supposed to be doing right
now Green Man Gaming oh Green Man Gaming our sponsor our sponsor Green Man Gaming all right let's go check it out can we brighten the screen yeah I can brighten the screen whatever you want Andy whatever's good for you all right o holiday sale well let's jump right into that obviously right and maybe uh maybe float plane chat can give us some suggestions you guys don't get to pick my three but you can give some suggestions for my three okay I still have never played a god of war game 
embarrassing what kind of game should we play oh dude civ6 is 20 Canadian dollars that's like 154 us or something like that what is this what's what's Anthology is like Anthology like not good or something like what happened if I switch to one of the other ones oh Lordy okay so so what makes it Anthology guys help me out here seven is just around the corner that makes sense yeah but I heard C six is really good I haven't actually played it Anthology includes all the civ6
content released including the game the six DLC Packs oh this is like the whole  right cool what else we got here why is my hotkey not working alt left Arrow hello buddy okay cool did that not go that did not go in the cart okay that's fine we'll add this card here there we go oh now I've got two oh balls I'll take a copy yeah um I I'll figure I'll figure that out later okay what else we got here bunge holiday sale do they even make games other than like Destiny like what what what's in here H
we got destiny 2 The Witch Queen Destiny 2 the light and dark Destiny 2 the final shape and annual pass Destiny 2 the final shape Destiny 2 shadowkeep pack Destiny 2 lightfall Destiny 2 Legacy Collection Destiny 2 bunge 30th Anniversary pack Destiny 2 beyond the light pack at this point people did I call it or what like people are thinking this is sponsored by Destiny 2 at this point it's sponsored by Green Man K yeah I'm not even I'm not even buying that okay let's find some let's find some crazy 
off M killer seven that's tempting for  bucks what else we got what is all this zombie stuff zombies on a plane zombie army 4 is there is are zombies trending right now is are zombies back they never left lonus you suck at parking sounds fun I think I'd be down for this I do kind of suck at parking the world's most extreme parking experience sure sure let's do it let's do it okay you suck at parkings in the cart let's show some more results let's find some deals here boys let's find one more and then we'll
get chat to pick between those three civ6 you suck at parking and um you know what I have never played an XCOM game which as someone who loved final Fantasy Tactics and generally loves tactics games um as if anybody ever put an actual real date in here there we go um is sort of embarrassing I should I should probably I should probably have played XCOM so I'm going to I'm going to check out this XCOM collection hello continue does it know I'm lying there's no way oh it's just taking
a sec okay all right that's going to be my three that's going to be my three would you like to do a poll we'll do a poll on float plane see which one they pick cuz we won't have time to do all three okay so we should see what maybe let them pick let them pick two okay um also you know what maybe throw God of War in there because I personally kind of want to see like a modern AAA game I'm just I didn't add it to my card on green man cuz I already own it uh let me actually let me make sure let's let me
see which God of War I own I bought one at some point cuz I was like okay this is embarrassing I haven't played a god of war game ever and then I just never played it uh so let me see which one I have and then oh my God I don't have how do I not have my own Steam account signed into this computer this is what happens when you are streaming live and  don't there we go all right cool I am now signed in but yeah let's throw let's throw God of War in there and then I'll just buy it from Green Man now if I
don't have the right one so you can go ahead and put the poll up all right so on float plane there's a poll top two win God of War civilization 6 you suck at parking or XCOM so everyone on float plane can vote I kind of want to try you suck at parking too I don't know I might just hang around and play games for a bit after I build my computer I mean that's my reward for building a new computer as I get to play games right well we're actually planning a stream uh we're doing a stream oh that's right we
are doing a stream we can promote the stream so just like we did back when Intel launched their Arc Alchemist first generation cards where we sat down and we played basically any game you guys asked us to play on Arc to see whether it would work or if there'd be any weird artifacts or anything like that we're going to be doing the same thing again this time with battle mage and we've got some ideas to kind of streamline it so our goal is to get through like double to three times as many games I have no
idea if we're going to be able to pull it off because between unskippable loading scenes and actually getting to the point in the game where you take control of the character and like all that kind of stuff there could be some there could be some challenges but we're going to do our best we're going to try Okay so no I only have God of War I don't have God of War Ragnarok so I'm going to go ahead and just add that to my cart real quick on green man thanks again Greenman gaming for
sponsoring the stream do I have any like talking points for them or anything like that it's just their holiday sale till January 10th go check it out they're adding more games uh up until that date as as well so keep checking back in you know every other day or so heck yeah okay do I want the digital Deluxe I don't think I care I could just get the regular God of War Ragnarok right I save uh eight bucks okay cool view Card wait which which four did I say I had you wanted God of War
civilization 6 you suck at parking and an x-com game oh that's right yeah it was an XCOM Anthology okay that actually looks like a pretty good deal okay that's the one that I'm missing I must not have pressed that all right why don't we continue our build here uh Elijah can you can you check this out yes sir all right thank you there XCOM the ultimate collection that's the one I want looks like you suck at parking and God of War winning right now anyways really that's what
chat wants us to play yeah but this is 89% off so I just want to buy it anyway because I don't have any XCOM games Okay okay so if you could do that and here's my wallet yippe thanks see you later well I'm going to buy myself some games now right no okay all right let's move on to our case this is another area where you could probably save some money compared to our build whether that's just getting a case for free from a friend or a computer shop or even a recycling pile or whether
that's I mean yeah that's that's that's probably the best way to do it or you could also just pick something up for like five bucks on on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist uh we have had a lot of success over the years getting free cases in fact I don't know if I can think of a scrapyard Wars where when you account for the other value of stuff that we bought like there have definitely been situations where we have exchanged money and gotten a case but I don't think that either Luke or I
have ever actually paid for the case as part of that if get what I mean like we were already getting a deal on the hardware itself and by the way there's a case or we get them for free getting a free case is such an like ultimate level hack for getting a better deal on a computer because this case cost us what was it like 40 bucks or something like that 35 bucks okay 35 bucks and it is boy is it ever unexceptional okay and if you think about that 35 bucks even though that's the cheapest case we can
find is still about what what does that work out to about seven to eight% of our budget so if we just didn't buy a case that's the equivalent of everything else we buy being on sale you know being 78% off and us being able to get better Hardware elsewhere anyway because the goal of this build was not to you know scrapyard Wars it the goal of this build was to build a brand new computer for around 500 bucks uh we did not go for the secondhand case option but this is a this is one of the big ways that you
guys could definitely stretch a dollar uh this by the way no I am not exceptionally strong this case is just exceptionally light this is the DIY PC s08 DG shockingly it has a tempered glass side panel it actually has kind of a pretty looking paint job it's just the um it's just the features and the room to work where it's going to be a little on the lacking side there's also areas were just like I don't know how much money this saved them but it cheaps out in ways that I don't think I have ever seen
before check this out check this out so where the io Shield Clips in okay normally you would have like a solid Edge along each side not on the DIY PC s8g no sir here you get a solid piece on that side you get a little tab on the bottom to click it into a little tab on the top you see that little tab Andy okay you get a little tab on the top and then on this side they took four little foldy tabs and you've got those four little foldy tabs to kind of to kind of click it against I don't even
think no I don't even think they play a role in holding it into place so you're just using the tabs on the bottom and the side to hold it in as far as I can oh no no they do they do yeah so you just got four little tabs there that hold it into place I mean realistically once the motherboard's in it's not going anywhere but you got this like weird Gap that I have never seen before see this this this Gap right here you see that yeah weird right what  do good tempered glass though doesn't  nice that was
close uh it's got um two front USB 2 ports front USB 3 front panel audio apparently it has support for 200 mm radiators I mean other than just being like the cheapest thing I've ever seen it's not bad not bad for features let's see what the build experience is like Elijah did you put in the standoffs that I need correct oh wow what a guy I was actually going to go down memory lane with you lonus you're going to go down memory lane okay well why don't you come over here on camera if you're going to
do that do you remember the last time we tried to save money on a PC case I do oh God I brought it with us today oh that's wonderful thank you Elijah truly it is a work of art that we are Unworthy of so yes you can get a PC case for cheaper and it requires some work Dan might actually have some footage from that video that he can throw up on screen here where we butchered the heck out of this case in order to make it fit Modern Hardware oh my goodness not just fit Modern Hardware have adequate
cooling for Modern Hardware look at those speed holes look at that fire extinguisher that you're holding cuz it started to smoke when you were using the  look yeah isn't it great and to be clear okay not every older case is going to be all solid panels on all sides and require this much TLC to get any Cooling and even if it does hey you can always just take off the side panel and take off the front panel um but realistically even spending what do we spend 35 bucks on this yeah yeah even spending $35 on a
case is um going to get you something that's going to look a little nicer and a little more modern I actually am coming around to this thing you know what I Miss though I miss like antech having killer uh case power supply combos like the anex Sonata for instance was just it was awesome because you got a decent enough case you got a quality power supply and it was at a really really attractive price having to buy those parts separately not in a bundle basically as a requirement like I can't
think of anyone other than like does like Raid Max or logicist still do case power supply combos I just I can't think of anyone who makes a power supply you would actually want to put in your system that does case power supply combos anymore what what's out there is there anything still I know logist still does logicist still does yeah I don't know about Raid Max though no offense to logicist I would not consider putting a logicist power supply in my computer I'm sorry it's just not really an option
this is this is Tech tips not Tech disaster show all right we're doing not bad looking pretty good apparently I'm supposed to do a merch message yeah sure I've got a couple here hit me Dan hey lonus as a darn tough fan have you also had issues with their socks being overly snug and difficult to put on is that something you have found with the upcoming LTT socks any advice oh okay am I rocking the darn tou today oh no I have prototype socks never mind ignore those um I actually consider that a feature
not a bug I actually like that long after their first wear because oh man okay I don't want this to get you know you know into like Kinks or anything like that but I can't think of too many things that I like more than putting on a brand new pair of socks like so good the point is the fact that darn top socks stay like tight so when you put them on they're like you know they're they're like it's like a hug for your foot I actually like that I consider that a feature our socks would
definitely have uh like a like a like a tighter kind of fit um but there's actually practical reasons for that as well I find that they work almost as like a type of compression sock for me so I um I I wear the like the high ones and I find that when I'm doing sports like whether I'm you know running or playing badminton or whatever else U I used to get shin splint back when I would wear like lower socks or I wouldn't wear tight socks so I find they actually work as a compression sock for
me and uh yeah I I consider it a feature um my understanding is that tight socks can help uh help prevent like blood pooling as well so um get used to it would be the best advice that I can that I can give you especially play oh yeah especially especially when traveling yeah Andy Andy is an expert on the dangers of traveling these days and I'm not going to get into any more detail than that because that would involve his personal information which I have not asked him if I can
disclose but um yeah compression socks on the plane very good idea now it's time to talk power supply this was probably the most challenging component of this build to choose because pretty much everything else was chosen for us the ark b580 is the only reasonable value GPU at the that we can you know Target this price point point with we went with the cheapest motherboard we went with the cheapest reasonable CPU the cheapest Ram the cheapest SSD then the cheapest case like everything else
we were just picking what we can afford for our $500 budget for the power supply you guys can probably already see that we spent a little extra on it we could have gone with a $20 special from someone like logicist or CoolMax um even oh over here even this smart 500 watt from thermal take would have saved us enough that we could have between this and the motherboard gotten down to our $500 budget we could have done that but the thing is Lucas from the lab he's a lot biger than me I mean I I I
don't know I think if push came to shove I could probably find somewhere to hide that like he couldn't fit and he couldn't like get to me either way it's not ideal so we were forced to choose something that he approved of and that's why we stretched our budget here and we picked up the minimum that he recommended the Corsair CX 550 wat bronze it's about $60 a lot more than I would want to spend that's about 12% of our total budget but it occasionally goes on sale for about 10 bucks off um
there's another thing to note about this it is not the full 600 watts that Intel recommends for this GPU but we talked to Lucas about it and he said that realistically that seems to come down to the arc b580 having somewhat higher transients and as long as you've got a quality 550 wat unit like a passible quality unit it should be fine and that's what we've got here so let's go ahead and get this installed so thank you Lucas and the rest of the lab's team for the hard work that you guys do to
make sure that whatever we're recommending even if we're on a tight budget is something that we can stand behind that is not going to fail you um when you're in the middle of a session all right let's get this bad boy installed we got four scre oh I guess I got options right um does this have a filtered intake on the bottom wow you know what for 35 bucks I'm actually kind of liking this case Elijah it's not the world's prettiest filter or anything like that but she's got a a filtered
bottom intake and raised feet so even if we're on like a medium pile carpet our power supply is not going to suffocate kind of I'm kind of coming around to this case Elijah right doesn't mean that I want to spend money on a Case when I have a $500 budget it just means that if I have to spend money on a case for my $500 budget I consider this one acceptable you haven't cable managed yet so we'll see that's that's true that is that is true words that you have coming from your mouth um do you have my
laptop yeah sorry I was I was hoping to look at floow plane chat but I can't M then sure hey lonus Elijah and sir besser do you still value and use mechanical gadgets like mechanical watches analog cameras or FX Rex over digital ones it's sad to see these industries is fading oh boy man I got to tell you I don't personally have a ton of nostalgia for Analog Devices like I I grew up with a rotary telephone and the second I got a touchtone phone I was like yo this is better and then when I had a touchtone
phone with a wire the second I got a 900 MHz cordless I was like yo drop kick boom see you later old phone and then and then when I got a cellular telephone phone I was like no way I don't have to be at home within range of my base station to use this dude progress I love progress dude my first camera I owned was a digital camera that was my first hold on trying to think if there's anything before that no I don't think so my first major expense growing up was I bought myself a
digital camera in I think it was grade 10 this is before I bought myself a PC so I loaded my photos from that digital camera my PowerShot a20 so this is like 500 bucks or whatever was a lot of money for me at the time I was I was in high school I I loaded my photos from my PowerShot a20 onto my Pentium I was either a 166 or a 90 or something like that like I I had like an actual crap tier computer it was more important to me to get a digital camera um and I didn't want like I forget what
it was even called there was like this weird little like really cheap one that was like you know 144p like weird video thing that I got for a Christmas present and I asked for a gift receipt I took it back I got like $100 credit or something like that towards that poot a20 that was like my first major paid for myself expense and I have never looked back at film and gone wow that would be so much better not once I'm so sorry um I'm just I'm the kind of person that when I'm
evaluating something I'm all about okay but how much does it cost me tomorrow like what's my what's my Perot cost with this thing um and it's not like I don't see the value of like developed photos it's it's a lot of fun to go back and look at old scrapbooks and stuff like that I I think that you know Polaroids invite they invite fun you know there's just something about it that is that is fun but I just I I can't get over the the the the calculating part of my brain that   $120
$120 and maybe maybe I'm just not a fun person maybe that's what it comes down to because I feel the same way going to like a commercial Paintball Field I'm like nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel you know like I just I I have a really hard time with things that have a continuous cost it's one of the reasons that I love PC gaming so much or at least I used to before everything was gcha um cuz you could buy that game once and get so much value out of it through you know the incredible
modding community or through multiplayer and and and always changing experiences and um it's one of the reasons that I just never understood like even when Xbox 360 was like the king and and was incredible I was like I'm sorry sorry it has you you like pay to play online like every  okay I guess see you later yeah I'll get that game eventually anyway and in some cases I was wrong um but in a lot of cases yeah I was uh I was I was less wrong so back to your question film cameras it's not even about the
inconvenience of developing the film for me because if anything I think that inconvenience is actually it it can actually be a good thing or like the less inconvenience more ritual right going there getting the putting in the film for development and you know whatever else and it it forces you to do it uh because otherwise there's no way to ever see the pictures whereas with digital you can kind of like quickly look at it on your phone and then you never bother you never get around to it
and so in some ways I actually think the convenience of film is sort of Superior in the actual experience of doing it uh because you might actually you might actually follow through and develop something I think printing things is really inconen and that's why almost Nobody Does it um but I just can't get over the the in my mind impracticality of paying um like a significant amount of money for every single shot I take even if it's like out of focus or crappy I like being able to
go click click click click click click click and hope that I get a good one I take a lot of my pictures of kids and animals though so like film is especially wasteful when your kids are making stupid faces or whatever else um we actually just shot a short circuit yesterday rounding up uh instant cameras so like Instax Polaroid um uh what's her nuts Kodak has Kodak has one that has like a little built-in printer in it and stuff like that and it's funny because they totally
knew Their audience when they prepped the video they prepared like a like a cost per shot for me as part of you know evaluating which ones um which ones I liked I actually co-hosted with yvon as part part of uh promoting Ivon week on float plane where it's going to be I think there's an interview with her uh she does a meet the cats where she shows off all of our cats so we're going to have that uh at lm. floatplane very very shortly sorry I'm just wiring up the front panel stuff I realize I'm just
building a computer not actually talking about it here did our 24 pin power connector our four pin power connector up here got our front USB 3 front panel connectors uh all this is this is nice like I remember old budget boards there's no way they would have you know all the connectors silk screened on there so you don't have to look at the manual or anything like that this is actually perfectly acceptably adequate to build in I have no real complaints so far HD audio boom all right that's it
our front panel connectors are done would you like to know the two games that won I I would like to know the two games that won yeah hit me it was almost 50% for you suck at parking nice and then God of War God of War so we're going to have to get this built cuz we're going to have to make sure those are installed because I didn't know that those were the two that we're going to win so well uh you could start uh downloading God of War now right possibly I onto a game drive you have do
you have a game Drive no oh all right cool now for the moment we've all been waiting for the reason that we are able to make a kickass gaming computer for a console like price the Intel Arc b580 if you guys haven't seen our full review view of this card it is a mustat but the tldr is that it's out for as little as $250 and in our suite of games it was able to handle 1080p ultra settings and never drop its average FPS below 60 to say that this is the type of game-changing disruptive GPU that the
entry gaming Market needed would be a gross understatement the fact that we're even calling $250 entry level is such a mind mindblowing thing to me it says so much about the way that Nvidia and AMD have abandoned budget Gamers like you used to be able to get something not garbage from Nvidia and ATI for like a hundred bucks in change nowadays cards for $110 actually you know what this is worth this is worth pausing not talking about Arc for a second and firing up New Egg again check this out you
guys we did this as part of the uh as part of the prep for the video okay here I'll just throw this on on the ground okay components and storage GPU and graphics card devices okay check this out gaming video cards here we go sort by lowest price okay let's take out refurbished let's see if I can find the refurbished tag this time condition here we go maybe this is where I was able to find it  oh this is actually not that bad okay you can get a 6500 XT hey where was that
where was that stupid junk from Nvidia that we well we haven't seen anything from Nvidia so let's see let's see what we can find from Nvidia we're all the way up to $170 we haven't found a single Nvidia card yet here you go you can find some okay how is this new are they still selling 3050s this has one egg I'm not even sure if I believe that we're all the way up to 100 $80 so apparently we have to change our filter to components and storage just gpus what's up I have this one yeah
there you go this is a 1030 if you want an Nvidia card for like a 100 bucks in change you are literally getting what is this like a seven-year-old GPU or six-year-old GPU or something like that the architecture was 8 years old I believe an 8-year-old architecture like guys this design is older than my youngest child pretty much only suitable for outputting a secondary display AMD a little bit better but this 1080p ultimate 1080p did I say ultimate I meant Ultra the point is it's got 202
generation battle mage XE course 20 R tracing units clock speeds of up to 26 70 MHz and a total board power of 190 Watts not to mention that they gave a huge huge Fu to the incumbents by equipping it with 12 gigs of vram for those of you who are out of the loop that's a really big deal and the conversation's been going on for a little while but obviously it hasn't been going on enough to reach nvidia's ear back when they released the 4060 there was a lot of conversation around
the $200 pay wall that they put in front of getting more than eight gigs of RAM because at uh I believe it was 3.99 you could get the 4060 with 8 gigs at$ 4.99 you could get the 4060 TI but still with 8 gigs of RAM and you had to go all the way up to 5.99 to get the 460 TI 16 gig which was functionally pretty much the same thing as the regular TI but just with a modern amount of vram on it and there was no 4060 16 gig so they had a 460 starting at $400 but if you wanted
something that was going to be able to keep up in modern games you had to spend $600 which is more than this entire computer even after we blew our budget now In fairness those cards have come down a little bit but anyone who invested in them got a really awful value uh we predicted and many predicted at the time that not having 16 gigs or at least more than 8 gigs of vram was going to be a problem very soon and it turns out that we are very soon o'clock later and it's already
a problem Indiana Jones in the great circle has a clear performance penalty from using an 8 gig card and it's only been what has it been like a year and a half since the 4060 came out I'm trying to remember what the actual uh what the actual timeline is Elijah do you mind checking the release date of the 4060 series for me real quick thank you so much in the meantime I'm going to look for a 632k screw here it looks like it was is June 2023 era oh my yeah so a year and a half ago
oh man I'm good nice nailed it go lus anyway the point is uh it has issues with 8 gig cards and that is in spite of it being an Nvidia sponsored title so you go and you buy one of nvidia's basic you know raid tracing ready cards or whatever and you're going to have issues with a game that comes out just a year and a half later anyway we've got our Arc battle mage in here let's go ahead  in here we go and a Boop and that's it that my friends is how you build a PC now this is not a
perfect PC in fact I would say that it's a pretty safe bet that um we would need to add at least I'd say an intake fan here I'd say once we've got an intake fan on the front to use this vent draw some fresh air across our GPU this exhaust and that intake working together is probably enough but worst case scenario we are on a tight budget we have 500 bucks to spend we can always add a fan later and we can run our side panel off until our you know our next lawn mowing session or you know whatever
it takes for us to get like you know eight bucks for a fan off of teamu or whatever um Elijah do you want to grab a monitor and let's uh let's get this thing going oh I guess I should do a little bit of cable management first do you mind grabbing a couple zip ties real quick I okay in the meantime Dan do you want to hit me with merch message yeah sure um doing a bit laggy on the stream here hold on let me just pause this um hi de restocking my gift card stockpile after the holiday buying have you ever got
refused tech support because of uh so-called incompatible Hardware like having GeForce not Quadro oh oh oh I mean we ran into something like this very recently I don't know about refused tech support but we've definitely been told yeah there's there's nothing we can do for you you've got the wrong thing in situations where I don't personally feel that that makes a lot of sense we talked about this when we were looking at that uh that spatial lab's uh stereoscopic 3D monitor that uh
that Acer co- developed and they have a commercial version of it that for whatever reason is locked from running games like you you you can't you you I I understand okay yeah fine I can't run the commercial stuff on the the gaming version of it no problem but why on Earth would you tell me that I'm not allowed to game on my like like professional grade one who are you to tell me I'm not allowed to play video games on this thing when it costs so much more like the one that costs more
should just it should be everything that the cheaper one is and more not just I'm not going to go buy another one to play video games um so I thought that was I thought that was pretty bananas that one was pretty recent I'm trying to think of anything personally though and nothing really Springs to mind for me Elijah have you ever run into anything like that sorry I missed the merch message sorry you bought the wrong you bought the wrong product I can't I can't help you with that and their example was
something like you know running GeForce drivers on Quadro just like artificial software lockdowns I I feel like I probably have had a story when I used to do it support like I reached out to the company that made the software that the company I was dealing with was having issues and they're like you're using unsupported hardware and I'm like your your specification was Windows 7 or newer so like what do you mean I'm using unsupported hardware and they were like well it's Windows 11 and I was like well
that's newer but it's like oh it hasn't been verified yet and it was like I had those examples when Windows 11 was just rolling out and we were deploying it on sites but I've definitely run into into um oh dude actually that reminds me yeah I've run into quite a few where they won't install because you have the wrong version of Windows uh but it like totally doesn't matter and once you force it to install it totally works yeah uh I hate that just try to install and if it doesn't work or whatever you
can tell me it's unsupported during the installer but do not outright block me from installing it that's just that's just wasting my time that's all you're that's literally all you're doing is wasting my time cuz I'm going to figure out I'm going to go find the file and I'm going to go you know fill in the versions of Windows that you support or whatever I'm just going to I'm going to go fix it anyway so all you're doing is making me do that which I don't like to do the worst part was doing tech support
for companies that are using older Hardware whether it was like a specific CAD license or something that like only worked on XP yeah and then obviously I can't phone the company and be like hey I want this to work on Windows 11 so I have to like figure it out I have to fight through either registry or other setting changes to get it to work because my client that we're serving refuses to change to anything newer which is fair you know what and valid in some cases especially with stuff like
CAD software it's super valid yeah like that machine just the panel by the way prove it okay anyways that machine just worked works and their technicians like they're they they they don't they don't care oh yeah they don't care about Windows or whatever they just need to get their job done no I get it man I get it I mean I think a lot of the time our crowd right forgets that for a lot of people a computer is not fun it is not a toy it is just a tool it is just like their pair of pliers it is just like
their you know work smok it is it is nothing but a tool to a means to an end um and for folks like that yeah I get it you don't want to just like go upgrading software and oh and in a lot of cases one of the reasons that they're locked into that older version of the software is not because a new one doesn't exist or that the new one doesn't have features they'd like to use but because the new one has switched to a subscription model that was the biggest complaint always I'm not paying for the
new version because I own this one and this one does everything I needed to do yeah so why but they get a pop up every four minutes or every time they boot it hey have you considered subscribing to the new one you'll get all these fancy features yeah I have considered it yeah  no um where' that spritzer bottle that you had go there's one behind the arc if that's what you're talking about yeah well I didn't really want ISO but this will work okay well yeah I just want I
want a nice clean side panel I want her to look her best you know that's fair nice clean looking her best side panel for 500 bucks hey 500 bucks dude it is so exciting for me to be able to build a $500 computer again yeah like this used to be my job uh back when I worked at NC I was in charge of like the PC configurations so I would I would you know go and I would try and come up with creative ways to save a dollar here and there and like try to build the best thing that I can for the money um did we
lose uh grommet from the side panel maybe when you it was already gone when I grabbed it from inventory oh got it okay so it's not our fault we didn't buy this brand new for the stream we're sorry guys but we already had it in inventory and it happened to be $35 so it matched our criteria got it makes sense mhm all right let's pop this bad boy on here oh yeah oh wait oh she's uh she's not symmetrical which is fine I can work with this there we go I was going to say  Elijah all right uh Dan want to hit me
sure we we've seen quite a few of wacky fan configurations from Alex and the team but when are you guys going to power a whole PC with the back feeding  compressor oh uh wow what would that even look like so we'd have to get some kind of fixed voltage out of the fans which means we'd have have to spin them all at kind of like the same speed we'd have to from there oh my God that would be I don't know if we're going to do that yeah yeah I don't know I don't know if we're going to do that the answer is
never yeah that's it's a cool idea but I think it's the kind of cool idea that as long as Alex doesn't watch the stream we're never going to have to do I'll the time stamp dude 500 bucks okay 540 but we could have cheaped out on our motherboard cheaped out on our power supply $500 class cuz we spent what four 540 bucks right yeah uh yes it came out to 540 total freaking awesome yeah what card did you use I just realized I gave my personal card to Vance for I grabbed the first one that was in there oh
no wait what this one I grabbed the one that looked like a bank card this one here yeah Ivonne is going to kill me that's a USD  CAD I didn't well do I spoil it that I didn't actually purchase with the card because we already have the games on our account oh I just did that for the fun of it cuz you gave me the card and I was like okay well I'm not going to actually I was going to buy the cards I was just going to put them on my account oh okay well you're good I didn't say buy the
cards I me buy the games okay I didn't actually spend any money oh I took it off camera cuz I was like oh it's probably just for the bit I was like like haha buy the games and I was like well I'm not going to actually dig through his wallet no I was I was I I don't fake things on camera I want to play those games well I'm not I'm not saying you don't want the games I just did you gave me your credit card and I'm like I don't feel comfortable typing  in stop staring at me awkwardly stop
just you're the one who's awkward all right bucko bucko I don't know man I I don't see I don't I don't think it's a big deal oh hey we don't have a desk pad oh we do have our modmat though this is coming this is going to be available on the store like next year right or I don't know if signups are ready yet but this is coming out about mid January signups are are up oh okay so then signups for the modmat are up I don't know if this is the actual final version uh but it looks
pretty close it's really close mod mat's freaking awesome I'm extremely proud of the team it is class leading in every way price quality I I believe the value of the information that's on it for like a typical PC Builder uh really really excited about this thing we worked with the um uh we we worked with the creator of the patented modmat uh mod right uh in order to bring this to Market so everything's kind of buttoned up there really really excited and like way more affordable
than a lot of the other options that are out there right now pretty cool all righty I still wouldn't recommend at a $500 PC budget blowing money on a on a modmat to build it but especially as you're getting up into sort of higher prices where that would not be a huge amount of your budget and wouldn't really cost you a significant amount of performance it's not a bad idea and comes with an anti-static wrist strap and all that as well of course wow the stream latency is really
low these days did they uh did they decrease the stream latency on float plane I have no idea probably maybe like check this out that's just like a few seconds that's really good great job guys thank  cool all right what do you think Elijah oh no I whammied it oh we closed the side panel I closed the side panel oh we're going to be here for 3 hours there's absolutely no shot that this thing powers on on the first go wait wait if we reopen the side if we reopen the side no that doesn't count
he's already ruined it it doesn't count once you close the side panel you have jinxed it officially sorry James yeah we really did try to get this done in a reasonable amount of time that's okay these guys like hanging out with us anyway why isn't he pluging in Dan hit me with a merch message sure what are you doing the power cable's not plugging in can I  go ahead Dan has any discussion happened on bringing back the Black Shaft for the Original Gangster screwdriver now that
the Precision has proven itself mine was stolen recently and I love the black finish compared to Silver um this is not for this monitor it was with the monitor that's why I I I can't I don't know what to tell you they don't go together um if we can find a treatment that is black enough and strong enough and durable enough and all the things that we need um we would love to do a Black Shaft screwdriver but we haven't yet um and I wouldn't say that the Precision is necessarily
um just just because we've done a black Precision driver doesn't mean that we would do a black shafted regular screwdriver there's a couple reasons for that one is that the Precision driver is not the kind of thing that we expect people to just Huck in their tool bag and you know get you know beat up um and we expect it to kind of live in a case whether it's ours or one from I fix it or someone like that uh we expect it to kind of be cared for a bit more and mostly just hang out in your hands or on
your desk on your project mat or whatever uh number two is that the screwdriver is not even made of this screwdriver is not made of the same material this is anodized aluminum so anodizing is an excellent high durability finish it's still going to chip occasionally if you know you ding it on something or whatever you can see I got a little one in M but because it actually transforms the top layer of the aluminum it's it's really really really strong um our shaft on the screwdriver
is stainless steel it's not an it's not anodized can you anodize steel either way it's definitely a different process and we have not found that it is good enough why don't you just like make it out of bers or something uh we are not exploring EX materials for screwdriver shafts anytime soon we've had enough nightmares with bad screwdriver shafts all right let's fire this thing up do you get it you ready black metal is it going to work here we go a fan is spinning yeah that's a good sign got that
RGB man AMD and Intel better together you know what's crazy five years ago those would have been swapped I know right yeah wow you went really high end on the uh monitor Elijah the power cable is not on the Shelf there so I just grabbed the next monitor okay well that's quite the monitor we've got like a QD OLED what looks like I think this is the 14 is this the 4K why what the heck D I think it is the is this the 4K 240 HZ yeah are you are you high sorry I don't think I'm
allowed to ask you that I don't think I can answer that why don't look at my [Laughter] eyes all right down want to hit me with another message we lost your mic did I really do that again hey it booted though okay hit me oh hey hey hey hey look that that's good that's good that's what we want uh Dan do you want to hit me with another merch message while I reboot this thing so that I can actually dial in the ram timings sure has uh sorry no we already did that one greetings from Colorado lonus what do
you think about 3D movies watch through a VR headset and the complete lack of services to watch 3D movies nowadays any thoughts on on completely VR movies oo okay I haven't tried Apple's VR Movie experience thing whatever it's called where you're on the submarine I really want to but after the review of the Apple Vision Pro I brought it back to work and then I've never touched it again um i' I've been meaning to grab it and bring it home and try that just cuz I what it called submerged or something
like that I think anyway I want to try it it sounds super cool I don't have an opinion until I actually try it but what from what I've heard it is super cool as for watching 3D movies in VR awesome I mean that is where you're going to get the best possible display um but for me it's the same thing again that I brought up in my review of the Apple Vision Pro where here hello yeah I'll do the windows thing okay yes sir or not I was I was going to help you like yeah just hold shift when restarting yeah
um what was I saying 3D movies yeah 3D movies so it's the same thing that I brought up in the review of the Apple Vision Pro right where it's the best way to watch big screen content as long as you're watching it by yourself and for a lot of people that's appealing for me it's not I almost never oh damn it I missed it one more time I almost never watch a movie by myself um especially not oh I'm trying to remember UI UI there we go okay trying to remember like if I'm just
like watching something on my phone I will um or if like I'm watching something at the gym I will but those are not things that I'm I have a VR headset on for like if I'm at the gym I am at the gym I'm not wearing a VR headset and if I'm you if I'm watching something on my phone it's because I'm in the bath or I'm like otherwise not able to be like bolted into something so VR headsets they just don't really they don't really have a place in my daily life other than beats saer just exercise
unfortunately I I love VR it's I I love immersive experiences I think it's super cool I'm so so so ready for a replacement to the index actually I got to try the I got to try the big screen Beyond with their audio strap I still haven't done that let me know how it is I've been meaning to also we have one of those VAR or whatever we have one of those vario headsets that I really want to try too all right what do you think we're going to are we going to get uh dop or XMP or whatever where the heck do
you even where do you even control that stuff here overclock mode bus speed Auto manual oh here we go XMP settings boom 3200 think it's going to work uh I think it's going to work okay I believe we're going straight to 3200 no problems I mean realistically it does come down to board layout and Trace design to an extent but it also comes out comes down in a big way to the integrated memory controller on your CPU and as far as I can tell AMD doesn't just you know put their the crappiest possible memory
controllers on their entry level chips all right do we have Steam on it steam should be installed okay here we go do we have a mouse pad by any chance cuz as much as I love the modmat it is not a mouse pad I mean I have a big one I don't have although this is convenient if we' used a modmat as our mouse pad back in the day when we forgot to remove those feed off of that mouse in a short circuit and we would have found them cuz I just moved it once and it removed the feet covers from this MSI 
feature all right let's I do not have an internet connection so we're going to have to sort that out we're going to need oh are there not what happened to the C Oh no I got it I got it I got it it was so managed by our magnetic Cable Management that I couldn't see it let's go I can't believe that this compter computer booted up I expected it to be whammied we downloaded those two games on the Z Drive can I help you guys yeah do you have the oh thing managed uhor I'll let I'll let you do it I'm going to
come over here and I'm going to be Dan I'm going to be producer Dan into a merch message hey Lexus I'm starting a new oh wait is his mic on Dan is your mic on am I in two mics yep oh and he's not going to fix it for me  problem yeah maybe the other way around nice Hi Alexis I'm starting a new water cooled build do you think it's possible to flood the loop with an inert gas that is denser than air before I fill the loop so that I can avoid bacterial buildup hi Mason B you are overthinking
it you just need to put a little bit of bioside in your Loop once you fill it and that is going to take get you right sorted out it's not going to affect performance and as cool as it is to like put inert gas in your Loop or whatever um yeah you you really really really really don't need to do that um I mean if you do make a video about it like that sounds fire but uh yeah you don't have to Matthew M says I was considering using magnetic Cable Management power brick holders to mount
some external hard hard drives under my desk but given the powerful magnets I was kind of curious good idea or bad idea you would actually be very surprised oh metal Maxine and float plane chat says argon cooled PC okay I have actually wanted for quite some time to see what happens if you cool a PC with some other gas like like a denser gas can you like carry the heat away from a heat sink faster like it I don't know I don't know it's it's something I've wanted to experiment with for a
long time someday someday we'll do it but but not yet um what was I talking about again uhoh I think I lost it right you would be very surprised how powerful of a magnet you need to have any kind of impact on a hard drive like I even hard drive manufacturers are having a hard time controlling flipping the bits and they have to use like heat assisted recording in some of the highest end drives now and some of their most dense drives um Ty in actually did a really good short on the LTT Channel where he
showed that unless you get into absolutely ridiculous territory a magnet is not going to do anything to your hard drive so I would say you definitely can um but I would question the need to do that because if your if your drive is sort of permanently enough there that you need to like cable manage it into your setup maybe it would be better to just install it as an internal drive there is a performance advantage to doing that over USB um look at yeah tinan says it'll stop
the motor if it's too close yes but if it's in an external hard drive enclosure it shouldn't he doesn't recommend mounting hard drives with MCM okay there you go tinan has spoken in chat but I sincerely doubt I sincerely doubt that in an external enclosure you would manage to get it close enough to cause a problem but take that for what it is he says don't do it so we don't recommend it officially there you go what else we  archive wait no way I Timothy M says do you ever miss the old days in the garage
and staying in my basement Timmy okay that's less weird than it sounds if you have the full context because there was a year that we went down to I think it was PS and we did stay in Timmy's basement it was it was voluntary like we were not held there against our will but but we did in fact we did in fact stay in Timmy's basement uh it saved us uh it saved us a hotel cost which was good and we got to hang out with Timmy tech TV which was also good and yeah I actually had our our Christmas dinner our first
ever annual Christmas dinner for smash Champs last night and between the full-tim and part-timers I think we're up to about 17 people 15 of which attended the Christmas dinner and it was it was pretty it was pretty fun it was it was different lmg has gotten bigger in all the ways that are good and in all the ways that are not as good um you know we have to be uh it's it's it's a more corporate Vibe things are a little more controlled they're a little more structured they're not
really off the cuff anymore and there's definitely really good things about that from like uh you know liability and insurance and and you know HR streamlining and you know all these things perspective but uh there are things that are more fun about working with a really small team and it was it was fun it was it was fun kind of hanging out with the smash Champs team even though I I only really know a handful of them like some of them are pretty some of them are really new like
everyone's pretty new I mean it only opened a few months ago uh but some of them are especially new like some have been kind of working behind the scenes in the leadup to the launch so I've and and I knew them before hiring them so so those folks it's uh it's a little more natural just like hanging out with but yeah everyone else is pretty cool too archive man these are these are coming in pretty fast here getting the merch M are you you guys doing okay over there yeah ragnaroks just having a
little bit of an issue booting we're getting an error code that we're just trying to resolve right now okay Ragnarok won't start from the nas so it might have to install it locally but it's 175 gigs oh wow uh it oh man at that point would it be faster to go get a higher speed Nick and install it and then copy it I think it might just got the steam Drive oh yeah okay yeah steam drive and know where it is no one knows where the steam Drive is oh good hey professional Tech Media company don't
worry we got this what was I going to say oh yeah do we have resizable bar installed while he's going and doing that do you want to make sure rebar is enabled in the Bios it should be by default on a modern board like that but we should double check CU Arc will not perform its best without resizable bar all right what else we got here Brandon s says I'm sure you couldn't make a whole episode about it but if you could take an excuse to look at Wheelchairs and hearing aid teex
someday it'd be validating to see someone talk about how old the tech is yeah the fact that the fact that it's been so obvious for so long that Apple was gunning for hearing the hearing aid Market the the the accessibility market and the incumbents have as far as I can tell effectively done nothing to prevent them from coming in and completely disrupting their industry is flipping wild to me it shows how something can be as mainstream as apple I want to make sure it's enabled and you can still have
an entire industry being like nothing is going to happen we can just keep charging insane amounts of money for ancient technology everything should be fine like absolutely wild to me um as for wheelchairs I got to be honest with you I don't know enough about it but I do know that that's something that Jerry rig everything talks about a fair bit and has done some really cool stuff in the space that's realistically the most that I know about it um the only reason I know anything
about hearing aids is just cuz I have a family member who is uh who's heart of hearing and who uh worked in a school for the deaf so I know a little bit of sign language I know a little bit about um I know a little bit about the culture but I'm always hesitant to I know enough about these communities to know that coming in as an outsider and talking about it is not necessarily something that I should be doing and while some people might be chill with it and appreciate the spotlight others would
really prer that I yield that Spotlight to you know um members of that community so it's a it's a tricky it's a tricky thing and I we we have looked at some for example accessible controllers and stuff in the past but it's not something that I like to dive into too much um pug boy says airpods don't compete with the concealed style of modern hearing aids though and that's fair enough but with the number of people that I see just walking around wearing airpods I'd say say having
airpods in your ears is as stealthy as just about anything like I don't know I don't know just saying just saying um but I can totally understand that everyone has very different feelings and you know what works for them works for them and my perspective on this is obviously Limited at best thank you all right archive that we don't Anonymous asks I was looking at those little 3D printed CPU clam shells that you guys use where do you get them I thought they looked 3D printed if so
have you released the St STL file or do you plan on releasing the STL file we absolutely plan to release the STL files for all the cool little things that we have created internally to make our lives a little bit easier it has taken some time for us to get that off the ground for reasons that I'm sure make sense to the people who are working on it but I do not fully understand um it's been a little frustrating to me that it has taken so long for us to release this stuff but I have been assured that in
the next weeks not months we're going to have our repository up with some of the cool little stuff that we have like we have for example for our magnetic Cable Management um power power bar key holder one we have uh we have one that takes one of those on one side and then hold a screwdriver on the other side we've got uh man I don't know we have so much stuff we have like little stacking things that hold screwdrivers I think we've got we we've got a ton of stuff including those those little CPU holders
and we want to put it all in a   um hi there says yron I just found out my Black Friday package got processed in Germany yesterday but I'm in China how much chance I will have it before Chinese New Year I'm going to be honest with youon I have no idea I cannot IM imagine why it would have been more practical for them to go all the way across North America all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then well into Europe to route to China anyone in chat like is that a is that a Thing versus just going over the
Pacific like I my best guess is that it just has to do with like capacity and you know how much capacity there is on the cargo planes and and that's how they're picking that's how they're picking the route versus you know the the shortest possible distance um draiss says that Germany is the major shipping hub and I'm like okay like that's cool um but yeah Anna maxtor says my package is headed to Peru and is also in Germany okay sure I have never been in China and ordered something from North America
before so shut up dig TF says say I've ordered on LT store before I live in New Zealand and that goes through Germany as well and that's just what because DHL is German too far gone says they live in New Zealand theirs didn't so it seems to just come down to whatever makes the most sense to them with their logic H good  everybody cool same for India apparently says Joshua all right cool wolf West says I think it's due to DHL doing that to save money I someday someday I will work in the shipping and
Logistics industry and I will learn how that helps save money um shipping things halfway around the world before sending them back the other Halfway Around the World in the other direction but now I do I have not done that and I do not know so I have no insight to share with you how's that going over there good we're lumping in Ragnarok some bringing a game drive over but we could play the other games if you want let's do that we can do parking let's do it let's play you suck at parking Linus all right I
assume this is a controller game do we have any controllers handy trick question David has a whole wall of controllers over there so why don't we um grabbing one really quick thank you  you did I just hit the mute button again I didn't oh good uh metal Maxine says Dan has an international Logistics degree I think is that true Dan yeah okay can you explain why everything routes through Germany instead of going like maybe on a direct path uh let me just mute this mic uh probably because
of like the standard distribution hubs right if I am always sending planes to one place just go to that one place instead of going somewhere else right if there's no direct connection kind of frustrating you think from like West Coast North America to China like it's China You' think that you'd have the Hub there why wouldn't you I mean like most FedEx I believe goes through is it is it Memphis like every single FedEx plane goes to their Hub they do all their maintenance everything like that okay okay plain
maintenance sure I don't I don't remember where UPS is is that Detroit I feel like this is the kind of thing that like AI would actually be perfect for helping with I mean they're probably using it already I I I just mean if you were to if you were to have you know more hubs yeah then you could kind of help to solve for you know what's the most efficient way to have it go do some stuff and then end up back at the main Depot for maintenance or whatever I don't know but sure there you have it
it's more cost effective apparently to just have your main hubs and then have everybody you know who is an expert at doing whatever of the crap it is that they're doing there and sure okay oh cool hey we've got the Nixie npo1 let's go press right trigger to accelerate let's play some you suck at parking I am I am stoked stoked to try this oh uh I'm also stoked on the fact that I'm getting a casual 380 frames per second on my $500 gaming PC now obviously this is not the world's heaviest game by any
stretch of the imagination I've also set the monitor to 240 and I think it's is it 4K but we're running at 4K let's go it might be worth getting the verification for Ragnarok going while I've already started installing it oh okay all right grass and snow are on let's go do you want to get a closeup of my 370 FPS that people don't believe me let's go let's get a closer closeup closer closeup 380 $500 gaming PC sick all right right trigger to accelerate okay oh okay left trigger to break
stopping is parking there is no reverse are you kidding me okay so I just need  spots you can steer oh oh you already parked here find a different way I know I can steer whoa let's go woohoo okay did that count I think that counted oh this is fun dude the driving physics in this game are so fun oh you can't reverse right that makes sense dude it's just drift Central I  it how have I never heard of this probably because you only play CS I don't play CS oh no oh keep pract oh yeah okay skip
tutorial let's go welcome to you second parking have fun parkster oh I don't think I'm going to be playing online what's campaign Inferno drive around find landmarks to Play Levels or in parking spots to unlock new islands okay oh my God you can go off the edge that that makes sense that seems like the kind of thing at Elder Hut okay let it Sizzle carue well this is fun Jan says this game looks so fun hey did I mention that we got it from our sponsor for today's video Green Man Gaming do I have any
more talking points for them or anything Elijah or not really man they just have a sick a sick sale you know they got a oh no oh my God I'm on fire my car is on fire what what happens I die I mean yeah kind of checks out um logically speaking oh oh oh okay uh I think I follow okay that counted apparently okay boom dude this is so fun I kind of love it okay so this time I do not take the first oh no oh oh oh  okay dude please tell me they have like competitive modes and stuff oh oh my God
no not that I should be competing in them oh what do you mean this is just like you driving IRL right I think I am better at parking than this in real life okay I just need to take this wide yeah there we go oh let's go oh my God this  shoot and a casual 390 frames per second right now oh well that doesn't work very well and we're in motion 540 oh yeah that was that was not a fair comparison though he was in the middle of nowhere dude this is fun oh come on okay it's sort of fun it's the kind of
like frustrating fun that uh you know some people are into  probably okay we're just going to take it a little slower here we're gonna okay we're going to take it a little slower what no no yes okay I got the second one and then yeah there's a third one still okay I can do this I can do this boom wait I only have 15 seconds I didn't even realize that each attempt was time wait I'm down to oh no you have a fixed amount of time time total to do all of them I only have 6 seconds left I
can't make it I can't make it Dan no last car last car oh my God I can still make it I just have to be perfect in every oh my god well out of fuel what  fuel either way hold on how quiet is this machine Andy stock pretty quiet oh good timing for train pretty loud yeah dude this thing's quiet I love this computer do we have uh do we have Hardware info on here uh maybe okay uh if we don't I'm going to get it real quick so then when we play our next game yeah see how uh Ragnarok is doing
as well hopefully go okay yeah yeah yeah  uh it's at 3% did you guys configure it to allow transfers to continue well gaming probably not I think like that by default okay maybe it might be on this drive as well oh okay so you can just add this drive as a uh game Drive really quick okay well I'm allowing okay let's have a look  storage at Drive boom here we go this is going to be great now we're gaming boys oh we might have we might have bunged it we might have bunged it no you're good did you add it as a
destination hold on hold on hold on I'm going to un I'm going to unbind that one game Drive d uh remove Library yes okay then I'm going to manage and uninstall God of War Ragnarok that i' I've run into this before where you're like downloading it to one of your game libraries and then you like plug in one that has it and then you go to launch it and it's like has no idea what to do you don't you don't want it it's a bad time all right let's throw the other game drive back on there
boom and God of War Ragnarok is ready to go okay before before we do that though let's go ahead and grab our portable copy of Hardware info which is a super super awesome Hardware monitoring program and I want to see what kind of temps we're getting on our CPU and GPU in spite of the fact that we have functionally no case airf flow we just have the one rear fan which In fairness is all we can really expect for a $35 case but um it's not necessarily ideal for having your Hardware running as nicely as
possible all right CPU which one do we want sure we'll take um T die Okay so we've got a little graph for our CPU now let's go grab a little graph for our GPU GPU core temperature GPU Global oh the current maximum temperature okay so that'll be our hot spot probably okay let's grab our hot spot and our core attemp for the GPU oh shoot I always I always do that a and of course it's a web search because why wouldn't it be a web  Microsoft I always do that I uh specifically removed the ability to do
that on your when laptops oh fud what sorry what ability did you remove from my w laptop they be able to the ability to web search from the start menu oh really yeah this computer and the other one too yeah I hate it we should do a we should do just like a like a Windows modding guide D Windows Windows yeah like it'd be probably a great little float plane exclusive no no I think that could be a Mainline video Elijah do you mind do you mind adding that to the next writers meeting we'll
do just like little tweaks like that we do like 10 Windows tips to make window better um there's some there's some really good stuff like better indexing for um uh for Network folder shares and stuff like that so you don't have to wait around for forever to the writer meeting yeah handful handful of stuff like that would be really cool okay okay God of War Ragnarok let's go oh I guess I'll be using my controller again probably casual yeah I'm not you're not gonna play God of War with mouse keyboard I
know I know jeez casual this guy oh what's updating okay comment R okay do you want to hit me with the merch message in the meantime then yeah sure I think I've got one left here true lonus could you showcase the commuter backpack and would it come with the big locking carabin or like the LTD backpack loved it but sadly lost it you oh you lost your original oh dude it's so big how'd you lose it no just kidding I'm just making fun of our gigantic backpack um yeah sure I can
show you guys the commuter bag if you really want we do have uh a commercial we just did and I believe oh no I think they just did the photography the product photography for the product page so I guess yeah it's probably not up there yet um oh seriously wow thanks so much wow there's so many people watching the stream today how you guys doing YouTube chat I never talked to you guys kosum says I play God of War Ragnarok using mouse and keyboard haah see this is why I don't talk to you guys because your
psychos god of war with a keyboard and mouse I mean I've never played God of War so for all I know it's a perfectly valid option I'm just bugging you hm Connor suggests if you do a d Windows Windows you should do it in sections this is safe beginner friendly and then like increasing levels of kind of dangerous like before you get into kind of any sort of like regist reg editing yeah exactly I think removing the web search is registry registry is it registry yeah man but the thing is like if
you I think there's scripts for it though yeah oh scripts are scarier I think running a script that edits your registry is way less safe than changing a couple of Val especially because the values often have names that somewhat seem kind of intuitive to what they do like if you're running a script that changes your registry I'd be pretty I'd be pretty skeed out by that you want to continue through the setup of uh God of War or the backpack you were on the backpack for the
commuter I can get through the setup if you want right um yeah sure do you want to do you want to do the setup I I can kind of run you guys through it it's obviously not as big oh look Elijah's backpack is here that's convenient Elijah I'm going to borrow your backpack just for size reference I'm not going to dig through it yet okay so there's the size comparison but what's really cool about the commuter bag is that it's not as smaller or as it seems in terms of carrying capacity
because the original bag has an internal water bottle holder and the commuter bag has an ex external water bottle holder so you do you do definitely have less carrying capacity and one of the biggest differences is here and the like device carrying oh okay well I can't open it but the point is that uh the original backpack has enough room to like stuff a steam deck at the bottom on top of your laptop and your tablet and then like another screen safe pocket there this is really designed for laptop tablet and
that's about it if you want oh hey look Dan's got his there you go so there's the original which you could put like truly ridiculous class of Hardware in and still have room for like your your chargers and whatever else you need um and then yeah like I said it's got the two screen safe Pockets instead of just the one in the commuter and then this thick Boy Pocket that has screen safe material at the bottom for like an ally or steam deck or a claw or something like that so a little bit less device
capacity but the pouch of holding does make a triumphant return so you can just like stash your Tech sack down in the bottom here you've got a bunch of organizing Pockets including some that are magnetic let's go or have zippers or like other means of kind of holding stuff in place um little kind of pocket down here our air tag pocket makes a return um it doesn't have the front organizing pouch either though which I really like for quick access but it's a smaller bag what do you want I think
it's 25 rather than 35 lers or something like that does anyone know does anyone remember off the top of their head it'll be on the product page don't quote me on that um but all of that is while still being very Tech forward while still having extremely robust build quality so we've got our dual grommets on the carrying strap so that's not going to come off it's not going to wear out we've got um a reinforced Stitch as well as a grommet on the bottom here because I hate it when stuff
like that wears out especially because it costs so little to reinforce it uh we've got the same style of straps that have been extremely popular on the original bag with sort of the the bridge here uh but we have the new contoured um shoulder straps that help make it a little bit more friendly to people with different widths of frames um that's a piece of feedback that we've gotten a lot on the original backpack is for more petite people uh it can be quite big and quite uh quite quite wide and it doesn't
really doesn't really come in and like like sit properly on their body so these new contoured ones um seem to be very widely compatible with humans um I think that's about all I have to say about that since this game is apparently ready for us to play we are currently on 4K medium but you could adjust if you would like yeah I think we're not going to go 4K okay let's go let's go uh wait seriously is this not going to  me oh yeah sure sorry Andy watch your cable is it how do I uh seriously I don't want to
good why why is modern gaming like this do I just have to set the render scale uh you might have to change the full screen so no it's that doesn't work oh I missed Okay so if I go window then I'm just stuck with window there's no full screen window let's see if chat has the solution here like is it just a is it just a scaling thing like render scale no this is just TAA Windows setting res yeah you might have to adjust it in Windows seriously it might be going based off your Windows settings for  stupid
ridiculous people are like change desktop resolution that is that is ridiculous um okay well give me a minute there's a couple other things that I want to have a look at okay we're on xss TAA quality let's go uh let's go quality oh well that changes our resolution sure okay our render resolution is a little oh false our render resolution is a little above 1080P and then we're going to be using xcss to upscale it that's about what I had wanted to do anyway so there we go cool um okay anything with dead zones
can I get rid of dead zones oh that wouldn't be in here anyway okay controller view controls can I no that's it maybe it's in gameplay I hate dead zones and I can't adjust them okay great oh fine whatever I'm over it oh my God  shaders uh what do you guys have running on here for FPS monitoring is that frame view or is that just the built-in steam one that's steam one did we did we not get frame view no cuz we had the built-in steam one oh okay uh the built-in steam one sucks we should use 
okay isn't dead zone the new like MOBA shooter uh no Deadlock but very close yeah Mr David can I help you are you I'm just hanging out I'm oh okay we're seven minutes over oh okay I'm not pressing you just hurry it up okay David's just standing here waiting hi lucky oh yeah Lucky's over there I actually curious how this dude this thing is killer to be well yeah but can it Whatever as well as yeah whatever got him okay there we go frame view INF guys I never used the steam one how do you
turn it off because I don't care about it and I don't want it uh and uh Elijah enabled resizable bar okay good got it I found it okay okay all right now we have a proper FPS counter whoa that's new oh did it stop cool so our a FPS is sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of around 70 with our 1% lows hovering between High 40s and low 50s occasionally  30 looks really good we're above 1080p right we're like I want to uh I want to skip this can I skip this no it's very short okay I love I love modern gaming
in insert modern year uh Dan you have merch messages I've got one more all right hit me will it be better to wait for the 50 Series Nidia graphics cards or should I go for a 4080 super currently just curious given the Tariff situation that is a very good question and the answer is that I cannot answer that for you it seems like a lot of the Tariff conversations could be just saber rattling but you never know you never know what's going to happen when a new Administration takes over in the US and
they are going to be dictating a lot of the terms for you know what the what the trading situation is going to look like into 2025 and Beyond so good luck everybody um we kind of laid out everything that we had to say about it and that should you buy a PC Now video that we did a little while ago so if you haven't watched that go ahead and watch it if you have watched it and you're looking for more information unfortunately I don't have any I don't have a  all right how we doing here it's almost
over all right David assured me it's short so if it's not short then you know who to blame you blame David and if is short you know to  miked was a a short joke I am seeing a little bit of stutter here and there but I don't know how much of that is because we're compiling shaders in the background so unfortunately we're probably going to have to stall for time while this finishes compiling shaders and then we can get a fair impression of how the game is running so in the meantime uh
Dan if you have any more merch messages coming in let me know otherwise hey maybe I'll do something really weird and I'll hang out with YouTube chat for a change scary I know right they are dude they are like unhinged every time I dive into YouTube chat I'm like why' I do this again what about twitch chat maybe they have something to say uh absolutely not no twitch chat's the worst what do you mean twitch chat's the worst they know they're the worst uh yeah Rob gar says Linus actually has no functioning
balls I don't know that's functional like that's like that's a no no they don't function yeah I was going to say that's an accurate twitch comment no the uh no the balls function it's the it's the tube that connects them that doesn't function yeah so the yeah no if anything the balls function too good that's why I had to Nerf them that's a crazy statement otherwise I would get too many more kids so what did you call uh your wife on Ludwig's podcast I called her excellent breeding stock that's a to
this day a crazy sentence what I mean it  compliment it's a compliment look it was on a different it was on a different podcast okay it was on a different podcast where what happens at wo stays at w yeah that was W show that on the yard oh that's totally fine then that's a different y look she was there she I wouldn't say I wouldn't say anything about my wife that I wouldn't say in front of her I'm just I'm just saying that like for us to not have more kids steps needed to be taken
we needed to take steps let's just go back to YouTube chat yeah let's go okay how's YouTube chat doing we've left uh we've left uh twitch chat now which is good a um extra cheese says Hey I just picked up a 7600 X 3D bundle at Microcenter for my first build What GPU should I grab I mean oh that's a tough one see like the best value gaming GPU on the market right now is the ARB 580 the one that we're featuring in our $500 build but you bought a 7600 X 3D you aren't building a $500 computer so I would say
at the price that you're looking at I would probably start to look more into some of amd's more value options and I'm trying to remember uh what are the what are the currently available ones a I find amd's lineup to be really confusing like what they what they have available at any given time like something like 6700 class yeah looks like those are still those are still readily available it's like over $500 it's a good GPU though 12 gigs vram um I'd say that's probably a good
place to start I see some people recommending 7900 gr but that's they got to you know it's balance right like they bought a 7600 x3d right they don't oh the GRE is whoa the GRE is cheaper than oh it's out of stock though yeah okay so if you could get one the GRE sure is a great deal but I don't see a single unit in stock does Micro Center have  man when did 70 when did 7900 GRE get so cheap poor Kratos sometimes AMD does this though where they like have a card or they have a variant of something that
theoretically exists but in practice they just like bring it out they make a few of them kind of disrupt the market kind of like trash the value perception of the rest of their cards and then it functionally doesn't exist and you're just like okay um good job AMD because now no nobody knows what to recommend anybody um yeah on Micro Center there's one from XFX and it says X available in store only uh and is out of stock in literally every location and that's the only 7900 GRE they have so it's like
yeah good recommendation but functionally doesn't exist so okay um like that's uh I remember having a conversation about this on wano a while back someone was like why do you never recommend AMD something was it like the Fury Fury cards or Vega or something and I was like because they're not real because AMD announced these cards made like 25 of them and then was like [Laughter] der and then they'll like do a price drop or whatever like promo them away and then effectively nobody's actually
making anymore and I even I even brought it up on stre stream I was like here look here's all of the like this card available on new You' got like this one brand and you go to like add them to cart and if you add any more than two it's like no sorry you can't buy any more than that it's out of stock and it's like yeah this is not even a real product um so amd's GPU division has done that like a number of times over the last five six years where they have these products that nobody's actually
building boards for AMD doesn't seem to be actually shipping any gpus they just exist as sort of like price disruptors for what amd's own lineup like I'm not saying price disruptors are bad they're good but they have to actually be available so that's one of the things that I've talked to Intel about with arcb 580 is like hey you need to talk to the partners you need to be like look guys okay $259.99 $269.99 for like you know if you've got a nice big cooler a really nice design or something like that okay
but don't let this get out of control don't let them be like oh finally an opportunity to make money on Ark we let's make another 20 bucks a short-term thinking you got to buy some market share right now work with the partners make sure you guys are getting these cards in the hands of Gamers building up the brand building up the install base giving the driver team something to actually a reason to work on improving their driers so you have more than you know dozens of people out there enjoying
art graphic like get the team motivated you guys all got to be pulling together there'll be time to make money make money later now is not the time um so I'm I'm hoping I'm hoping that that makes its way to the top that that makes its way to the add-in board  hope shoot did I just do it again I don't know what it is but I'm going to put this on the other side cuz I'm no no no I'm just I'm going to put it on the other side so that I don't do that anymore okay there we go now I can now I
can lean against my table I can get comfortable here all right shaders are almost compiled we're at 89% and this boy is still running pretty  there definitely some dips and 1% lows definitely a wolf but at this it's a very demanding game though I was going to say at this price it's actually cheaper than like a PS5 and a PS5 Pro right so like no $500 well no sorry the the the disc list version I guess no the the the PS5 was on promo this Black Friday for like oh I missed that then oh
that's my bad yeah I'm trying to think I think that was it that like 350 bucks or something like that there were some 380 okay PS5 Slims were going for as low as 380 for Black Friday so a PlayStation is still an outstanding value from a hardware standpoint but the difference is that you're locked into their game store so you're not going to be able to use our sponsor Green Man Gaming to get tons of great deals on games um you're going to be stuck paying with with a console you're going to be stuck paying
subscription fees potentially you're going to be stuck with um a higher potential cost to repair it if anything happens down the line whereas with a PC that's modular like this something goes wrong you just fart a new one into it and you're good to go so there are like anything there are pros and cons both ways people who game on PlayStation are not idiots they just take that set of tradeoffs that they prefer and people who game on PC are not big dumb idiots they're just people who prefer that set
of tradeoffs um so no a PlayStation 5 is absolutely still a very compelling value from a hardware standpoint it's just that what we are now is very comfortably within the price bracket we're we're within the price range instead of having awkward conversations that go hey lonus I bought a 7600 x3d at Micro Center What GPU would you recommend and literally the only like stepup class of GPU that I can find is going to cost you $600 freaking dollars just for the GPU before you've even got a case CPU Ram power
supply cooler anything else right and that's what I am super excited about that's why we did the stream we only planned this stream when I sat down and did script review um no I think it was even after script review I think it was when we uploaded the video I watched it back I started reading some of the comments from people and I was like holy crap we can we can oh no must have been script review because it was in script review that I was like hey we should talk about how you can kind of build a
$500 gaming PC again okay it must have been then but we only planned this like last minute to do a stream building a $500 gaming PC because I was like oh my goodness this is it this is the key this is what unlocks it um so this was just cuz I was excited to finally be able to show you guys with a straight face a great value gaming machine with all new parts for around 500 bucks it's 540 for those of you tuning in now $540 we did cheat a little bit but there are areas where you
could save yourself 40 bucks instead of buying a brand new case you could just go find one uh at a local recycler ATX standard hasn't changed in years decades actually literally decades so you could throw this Hardware in some random case pull the side panel off you know get out to PA pliers just bend things out of the way if you got to stick your GPU in there you could save some money there you could probably save some money on the motherboard if you're willing to go
for like a weird like you know TOA um to Bow brand or something like that uh I think you could probably Save A Buck on the power supply if you're willing to go with like a thermal T smart you could even get this under 500 bucks but 540 was what we were comfortable with with all brand new parts from brands that we know are going to actually back you up in the event of a warranty claim or something like that freaking incredible our shaders are 99% compiled and let's have a look at God of War Ragnarok on a
$500 gaming PC we're running at 4K but not native we're using xcss upscaling and so the native rendering is at about 1080p so this is about what you'd get at 1080p in terms of frame rates about it's actually a little higher all right come on shaders man don't you love that don't you love that computer developers they they have the world's most warped definition of the last 1% of things that I think is possible I and I understand it's not entirely it's not the developer's fault there can be
unexpected challenges and I get it I get it I get it I get it I'm not ragging on you you do great work thank you uh but ah there we go we are finally done compiling shaders all right am I allowed to skip this no it's a cinematic experience L all right it's a cinematic experience well what we can do is we can nope because there's depth the field so we can't even evaluate how sharp it looks now we can actually not bad there's some messiness in the beard uh when it's moving so you're you're
definitely yeah as his as his face swings back and forth if you know what you're looking for you're going to see a little bit of upscaling artifacting I'm also seeing the odd dropped frame but we've also talked a fair bit about how this is not a 4K card this is it well outside of its comfort zone uh turkey submarine says I wish I knew the specs of the PC yeah we can run through that so we've got a uh ryzen 5 5600 right uh or was 5500 sorry it was a 5500 5500 ryzen 5 5500 six core
processor 16 gigs of ddr4 3200 megat transfer per second memory we went with an ASRock microatx motherboard the just the cheapest we could find from a trusted brand uh we've got a Corsair cx550 550 wat power supply that was the minimum that Lucas from the lab would allow us to use even though we could probably save some money with oh it's not there anymore but whatever with with a cheaper power supply uh this a DIY PC some cheap case just the cheapest thing we could find and then an Intel Arc
b580 a patriot p300 SSD oh yeah that's right Patriot p300 SSD as well we went with a 512 gig because that's what fit in our budget if we wanted more storage then we've got four SATA ports and I did confirm there is in fact a hard drive mounting point in the bottom of the case so we could add something there and am I ever going to get to actually play the game remember when David said that this opening cinematic thing was short yeah I I remember remember when chat picked
this game let's blame chat yeah way to go way to go float plane chat 175 gigs of just movies that's crazy all right let's go come on yes yes yes you need to sleep I know it's tiring being the God of War whoever said they wanted Firefox as the game that's not an option you can't can't have that look I know you all play Firefox we just wanted you here longer yeah I mean mission accomplished then I suppose all right I'm going back to I'm going back to YouTube chat they seem more
trustworthy YouTube chat Redemption Arc wow um maybe they just go really weird on Friday nights we're not at 2500p upscale to 4K Toby we're at more like 2200 which is a lot lesser than it sounds like as resolution scales um the amount that you're adding is so much more or as you go bigger or oh whoa look at that we're in game hey we're in game what up yo all right  can I run oh okay dude not bad not bad you're playing like modern  games like for real on this machine our previous attempts at like
budget gaming PCs for the last like five years have been so frustrating because either we had to go secondhand which I know there's a there's a cohort of people out there that are just not going to consider it right so we either had to go second hand which upsets those people or we had to seriously seriously compromise on performance like when we did our holiday buyers guide Arc battle mage wasn't out yet our recommended PC had an APU because we were like well realistically at this price you can't
afford a GPU anyway so you might as well get an APU which will game at like 108p low in AAA games or might even be forced to go down to 720p and then you can save up for a GPU it was like the merry Christmas wait for your birthday PC I think was what we called it this is the merry Christmas right now today PC as long as you can get your hands on an arcb 580 super exciting and I think that pretty much wraps US unless Dan you have another merch message or two I have one final
merch message for today all right hit me from Anonymous they bought a Precision multi pit and a Precision buil set your laptop skin looks absurd you weren't supposed to use it beyond the Qualcomm daily driver challenge signed a robot uh oh no way no way I could actually be debrand I mean no one else would have any way of knowing that I wasn't supposed to continue to using it it's not even for my laptop like honestly I keep using it as much to upset them as anything else so they're they're on to
me like look at this it has a cutout for a Microsoft Surface this isn't a surface you know how they're all about Precision Fit and everything this doesn't fit at all this is just complete complete nonsense and I've added more stickers to it now yeah I know it really does look awful if you don't like it dbrand maybe you should make better skins oo like the glow circuit and you could check out our uh you could check out our sponsor Green Man Gaming uh they've got a great sale
running right now we picked up did I just break something cool did that game close when I dropped my computer next to the PC that was weird did I did I click something I I was not paying enough attention all right neat anyway uh the point is uh Green Man Gaming check them out we picked up some actually pretty great deals on games including you suck at parking um we're going to have them Linked In the video description thank you guys very much for tuning into the  Elijah pathetic um all right play me out
