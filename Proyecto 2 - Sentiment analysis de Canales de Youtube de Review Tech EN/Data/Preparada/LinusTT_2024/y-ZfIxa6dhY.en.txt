it's been a pretty sad depressing year for desktop CPUs Den 5 was cool literally but not exciting and then core Ultra 200 was interesting but unimpressive today that changes behold the blessing that AMD hath bestowed upon us imbued with second generation 3D vcash higher clock speeds and more power the 9800 X 3D somehow tops our gaming charts and it runs cooler than the x3d chips that came before it what the heck that's not usually how that works at all is something wrong that's a good
question it seems like you never had enough energy these days get a boost with our sponsor Eco flow and check out their rapid magnetic power bank it's got 22 wireless charging and the building cable according to the testing the iPhone 15 Pro charges to 50% in just 25 minutes you can learn more at the link  while the 7800x 3D came out a year after the 5800 x3d it still used what AMD calls first generation 3D vcash so sure the new chip performed better than the old one but the big selling point the 3D
Vash wasn't all that different physically AMD piled a bunch of extra cash on top of the chip threw game games at it and then generously distributed high fives throughout the office with the 9800 x3d though we're getting something fresh we're still getting the same number of cores eight cores with two threads each and the same amount of cash 96 megabytes of level three and 1 Megabyte of level two per core but they've gone and they've put all of that juicy 3D V cache below the core complex
die which contains New Zen 5 processing course this change allows for better Cooling which also seems to have allowed AMD to juice those cores a little harder resulting in a 200 MHz uplift and boost clocks over last gen and a surprising 500 MHz increase to base clocks now the official TDP has actually remained the same but our 9800 x3d is definitely sucking back more power both in productivity and in games and what's especially cool to some of you watching this video is that AMD has committed to
finally unlock these chips allowing overclocking we're going to be looking at four different platforms today Intel 200 series Intel 14th gen am4 for The Savvy Gamers who bought into that long live platform and amd's 9000 Series non x3d chips we also threw in a ryzen 3600x for anyone who's on a slightly older platform and is wondering if it's finally time and you know what it just might be do you like generational uplift how do you like them generational uplift this jump in f123 at 1080p low it's not
quite as big as the leap from Zen 3 to Zen 4 with only about a 5% Improvement in 1% lows and about 8% in averages but for those of you who have been holding on to am4 an upgrade is starting to look a lot more enticing we're talking about a 20% Improvement in average FPS and 13% in lows compared to our 5800 x3d then there's Stellaris going from a SIM time of 110 seconds on Zen 3 down to just 92 for Zen 4 that was good hitting 78 seconds on the new 9800 X 3D that's even better there is some decent competition
from the other zen5 chips our 9700x isn't too far behind here but now that we've got all of those IPC gains from the 9000 Series alongside 3D vcash the true gaming winner is clear and things look dire for anyone who's trying to compete with AMD in Shadow of the Tomb Raider look at this it's all AMD all x3d at the top with the newcomer breaking the 400 and 300 FPS barriers in averages and 1% lows respectively there are other good options here the 5800 X 3D is still a great performer and its value cannot
be overstated especially if you already have an am4 motherboard but they've gone end of life so getting a deal on one might be a little harder in the short term there are other options though and we're going to talk about those a little bit later during our value analysis bit for now let's come back to game benchmarks where cyberpunk shows similar gains over every other chip and Intel gets just demolished across multiple Generations I mean I guess a little more gen to gen uplift would be nice to see
for the 9800 x3d but it's clear we're off to a bloody good start and a bloody good continuation Total War Warhammer 3 is yet another win it isn't much better than the 9700x but it is better while we've got a few more games where the improvements for the 9800 x3d are certainly less impressive there's decent improvements to 1% lows in Red Dead Redemption 2 particularly over the 5800 x3d and while rocket League doesn't seem to care much about 3D vcash the 9800 x3d actually rocks in this game Crossing 800
frames per second in averages which puts it right near the top of the list but here's the thing for CPU reviews we test at 1080p low this tells us which CPU is the best by removing any other system bottlenecks like the GPU but it's kind of like comparing cars based on their top speeds it's good to know and a faster car is a faster car if that's what you want to spend your money on but it's not necessarily representative of the daily Driving Experience for a typical user so what happens with our
x3d chips when we daily drive them bumping up the resolution in the in-game settings I mean we've got a 490 on the bench we might want to use our 49 90 and as it turns out 1080p Ultra and cyberpunk doesn't give us a huge reason to upgrade to this new CPU all three of our processors perform well enough and as we get more and more GPU bottlenecked through 1440p and 4K resolutions it becomes harder and harder to justify and yeah I know cyber Punk not the be all and end all but out of the four games we
tested at Ultra cyber Punk was actually the one that saw the most Improvement black myth Wukong set to ultra is basically neck and neck across all three resolutions and so is f123 with all three chips within a few FPS of each other as for Red Dead Redemption 2 even at 1080p there's really not a lot of justification for this upgrade if you like to make your games look pretty which is all kind of a downer I mean I was pretty excited but it could be exciting for those folks out there who
don't have a ton of money to upgrade to a new platform with ddr5 speaking of it's been a while since I am 5 debuted so for funsies we tried some different memory kits to see if Ram speed is important on our new ryzen 7 and it is but not very faster memory resulted in more average FPS 1% lows or both on the three games we tested but not by that "much with 6,800 megat transfers per" second looking like the sweet spot for Value coming back to legitimately compelling reasons to upgrade though I
want to talk about how much better thermals are on this new CPU both the 98 800 x3d and the 7800 x3d are rated for 120 W TDP but only the new CPU actually draws anywhere near that amount in our testing in cinebench last gen only draws about 82 Watts on average while reaching 75° C our 9800 x3d thanks to putting the vcash below the CCD is drawing up to the full 120 watts while running 7° cooler on average now this testing was done with a 360 m AIO but what is clear from looking at these numbers is that you
could Max this thing out with a modest Tower cooler and never worry about thermal throttling it's also going to be a dream for small form factor Builders and that carries through the gaming as well in our f123 stress test we're only using a few more watts on average but we see another 8° drop that is flipping wild and it kills any interest that someone might have had in other CPUs that have been Bri about new lower temperatures actually AMD Zone included but what about the teeny tiny elephant
in the room let's talk about productivity while many of you out there are only interested in gaming many others enjoy Computing in a different way I want to take a closer look at the 9800 X 3D compared to its 9000 Series brethren in blender it's a few seconds behind the 9700x and way ahead of last gen respectable in good compile it now beats the 9700 X but is significantly behind the higher tier AMD chips handbrake same thing Photoshop sees the only clear win for the 9800 X 3D but
then Premiere it's back just above the 9700x prime seeve okay same thing wide cruncher I think we're sensing a bit of a pattern here um how about seven zip uh yep okay cin bench oh this is something a little different it beats the 9700x in multicore and then Lo es by just two points in single core very cool you know what's not the same thing by the way our new commuter backpack from LTT store.com same Great Tech first design philosophy I'm going to reach it 5 L smaller sign
up for a notification today anyway the bottom line is if you were looking at the 9700x as a solid do everything CPU this launch might not change that much I mean sure this is objectively the fastest game CPU on the market and if you want the best of the best this is it but bear with me for a second here at MSRP the 9800 x3d costs a whopping $230 R dues or $150 more than the 9700x and if you're spending almost $500 on your CPU alone are you really gaming at 108p I'm not trying to shame anyone
who is some of you are probably literally professional Gamers and you've got your reasons but for the folks who aren't trying to go pro a decent 1440p gaming monitor is like 200 bucks these days and it's probably going to do more for your enjoyment than a shiny new CPU that shaves a little bit off of your frame times and even for the folks with aging systems the 5800 x3d it's end of life but you can still purchase a 5700 x3d which is only a little slower brand new for $200 at the time of filming that
means you could throw in a ram upgrade a 2 TB m.2 SSD and a nice meal and you're still paying less than you would for this CPU alone now there are other reasons to migrate to a new platform pcie Gen 5 for example that might be a Difference Maker when nvidia's 50 Series arrives in the next couple of months but you should choose based on what a purchase does for you today not based on what it might do for you later so don't get me wrong the improvements that AMD has made here especially when it comes
to thermals with the second gen design are awesome I mean it's refreshing to have something to be excited about for a change and I'm sure these are going to fly off the shelves as Gamers make the move to am5 we're going to have all the CPUs we tested today Linked In the description below but with the pricing being what it is I think it's worth taking a second look at the rest of the 9000 series or even last gen if there are deals to be had either way it looks like team red is going to do just fine
over the course of the next year and after their last launch I was a little worried that AMD might need to turn into a different kind of chip business with a whole new website like the one I make for my dog Workshop in just a few clicks you can turn your weird hobby into a real business too thanks to our sponsor Squarespace we've been using it for years for our own website it's so easy to get started even my dog can do it but Dennis I can just code the website myself can
you Squarespace has a tons of beautiful template and that's now all he has everything you need for business like invoicing marketing scheduling and more and right now you can get 10% off your first purchase at squarespace.com LT if you guys enjoyed this video hey maybe you're the kind of person who roots for amd's Success so why not go watch our core Ultra 200 series review for more AMD success
