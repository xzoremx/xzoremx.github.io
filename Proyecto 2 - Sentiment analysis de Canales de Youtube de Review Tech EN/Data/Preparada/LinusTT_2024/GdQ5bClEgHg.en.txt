what I'm about to show you isn't exactly legal but legal doesn't necessarily mean something is right anyway does it it's legal to raise my subscription fees whenever they want it's legal for them to control how I use my own account and the media I paid for it's legal for them to keep showing me ads and steal my data when I pay for the service and it's even legal for them to take my money and disappear into the night with my media now piracy can be just taking things without paying for them but sometimes
it's a little more noble than that sometimes it's about taking control back from the powers that be reasserting our right to own the things that we've paid for and use them however we please so I beg you look at this big movie studio exec it's blurred so you won't have any ammunition for a dmca takedown but believe me when I say that it's your Blu-ray and I'm streaming it from my PC to my phone because I don't care about your rules and guess what I'm going to take it one step further and show
everyone watching how to do it who knows if you have a techsavvy nephew or something you might even get them to watch along and set it up for you it truly is very convenient of course as you know creating video costs money though so I can't tell your nephew anymore until we get through this message from our sponsor MSI game like it's going out of style with the mpg 341 CQ PX QD OLED monitor experience gorgeous visuals Lightning Fast 0.03 millisecond response times and a 240 HZ
refresh Ray check it out using our link to rip a Blu-ray all you need is the disc a compatible drive like this one from LG will'll have a full list link down below and a computer or NZ with a lot of free storage space start by downloading and installing make MKV and SDF tool flasher as well as the custom firmware for your drive from the guide that will also have links down below then use SDF tool to flash your drive by pointing it to the firmware you downloaded next pop the dis in and use
make MKV to back it up making sure that you select decrypt video files hit okay and in about an hour you're going to have a copy of your entire Blu-ray disc that is tucked safely away in your computer and you're done well sort of you can play the full quality m2ts video that's usually found in the bdmv slst Stream folder the biggest one is going to be your movie and the smaller ones are usually going to be extras or special features but if you want a more broadly compatible file that will play
nicely with more devices we recommend remuxing or re-encoding your video remuxing means simply changing the container of the video file without altering the quality or size if you go back a few steps you can actually choose this option right in make MKV this is a great choice especially for diss that have playlist obfuscation as an anti-piracy measure which could lead to glitches or or your movie being split into chunks apparently lion gate movies are notoriously bad for this make MKV
can attempt to load the Blu-ray menu in Java to help you sort which playlist holds the correct files to remux but if you're having issues there are resources that would prefer to remain anonymous but that can be found with a quick Google search on a per movie basis but if you want the whole dis on your drive you can also use MKV tool NYX to convert specific files to MKV for your personal enjoyment if you want both better compatibility and a smaller size though a full re-encode with handbrake is the
way to go re-encoding means fundamentally rearranging the ones and zeros of the media file in a matter that can shrink the video size but usually at the expense of some quality to do this open up handbrake and drag the entire backup folder into the window let it scan and when it's done use the drop- down menu to select the Right video file or files look for the ones that the proper length then choose your export preset this one is great for very high quality Ultra HD but some of your
devices might play better with hvc you'll have to play around with things a little bit to see what works for you but here are some starter presets there's a lot more to fine-tune in here like audio tracks uh the ability to keep or remove certain languages of subtitles or even burn them in uh we'd also recommend changing the frame rate to same as source and once you're done you can hit go and wait anywhere from several minutes to several days depending on on your settings and Hardware once
everything's encoded up the way you like you add it to your favorite self-hosted video streaming library and that's it you've got your own personal Netflix one that can't be taken away from you and never goes up in price but the Simplicity of this whole process is a little deceptive before these userfriendly tools could be developed a lot of hard work was done to break the encryption of Blu-ray discs and of the DVDs that came before them but that wasn't always the case the difficulty
Cur has actually gone very easy very hard back to very easy so how about a fun little piracy history lesson in the early 1980s when CDs were unveiled to the world hard drives for home computers were hovering around 10 megabytes of total capacity to put that in perspective it would take about this many hard drives to store a single CD album Sony and Phillips The Joint creators of the CD standard didn't bother to write any form of copy protection into the specification because the pricing of CDs was so
competitive compared to those hard drives I mean what are you going to do spend A4 million dollars on drives or just head to the local Sam goodie for a new $20 copy but by the early 2000s things had changed CD burners had become commonplace in home computers and the price of storage had plummeted that combined with the adoption of compressed audio formats like MP3 the growth of broadband internet and the rise of easy to to use piracy networks like Napster took music sharing mainstream by the
time things really reached the masses DVDs had already been a thing for about 4 years but the makers had definitely learned at least some lessons from CDs there were many restrictions built into the DVD specification that prevented duplication and piracy however they were relatively primitive and were ultimately defeated by Brute Force attacks by the time most new PCS shipped with a DVD drive then libraries that could decrypt DVDs were readily available you just needed to know where to look Blu-ray on
the other hand took longer the copy protection is vastly more sophisticated even including the ability to revoke and issue new encryption Keys through new discs but the industry was also going up against much more powerful computers in the hands of much more experienced hackers it's an arms race that the studios can't possibly hope to win in the long term speaking of long-term that's reason number one why we made this video and why we think you should be ripping your Blu-rays Mass failure of
entire generations of optical media is coming and it's coming really soon due to something called disc Rod Blu-rays actually have the shortest expected lifespan of any commercial disc format yet at only 5 to 20 years and while hard drives and ssds also fail sometimes even faster once you've backed up your discs it's much easier to move that data around and back up your backups reason number two is video quality streaming services are absolutely a viable alternative to get convenient access to
your media but to hit their profit Targets in a very competitive industry they've made serious compromises to picture quality a 4K Blu-ray can go as high as 144 megabit per second whereas most streaming services are currently sitting under 20 now most of the time it's fine but as TVs get bigger or as you get to those ever more popular underexposed dark scenes the lack of detail and the graininess can take you right out of the drama and that's even ignoring the loss in audio quality I get it and coding
efficiency has come a long way in the last decade but no it's not enough to make up for that sweet sweet raw data number three if you're buying your Blu-rays to rip you will actually be better rewarding the movies that you actually like and this one is probably the most important point the best movies rarely have the best box office returns but in the past home sales have rewarded those filmmakers that took a risk and couldn't find an audience in the multiplexes of yester year and at the
time the accepted wisdom was that a movie only really needed to double its reported budget to remain profitable this is due to marketing budgets often matching that of production budgets not to mention the fact that a theater takes a lot of the gross receipts however it's been suggested in recent years that to break even the required box office Target is now more like a factor of three or four as streaming services have caught a whole out of the Post Theater profits now I sure as heck
don't miss paying $30 for one movie but it's also important to actually support the creators making the content you love if you ever want to see any more of it as content creators ourselves we rely on multiple means of supporting ourselves ads subscriptions and the fine merchandise on LTT store.com like the insert merch promo of the week here well we'll have something that pops up anyway I realized that my take on this stuff is a little more nuanced than the average redditor is going to be able to process
but I'm definitely not anti-piracy you do whatever lets you sleep at night I've always said that I just feel that it's my responsibility to paint the complete Corsair canvas um Studies have shown conflicting reports on the damages of copyright infringement on creative Industries for example an EU study often disproportionately cited by proponents of piracy shows that video game sales actually go up as a result of piracy presumably due to increased Word of Mouth however of 34 academically
reviewed studies pertaining to piracy 29 of them have found that online copyright infringement causes statistically significant harm to legitimate sales only five studies found no harm to legitimate sales in fact that same popular EU study that seems to validate game piracy showed that both the book and movie Industries have suffered due to piracy especially when it came to newer movies so in this endgame corporately driven Society we know that only your money speaks and divesting
from the services that are proud to announce they now use only 30% machine judgment to Greenlight their shows is a good first step but you may also wish to invest in the things you want to see more of so also kind of fulfilling to own a piece of what you love and yes I unironically Love Despicable Me deal with it that's reason number four under the current state of digital laws you don't own anything you're more or less leasing the right to access the content and that applies even to digital
purchases of full movies from services like Prime uh Apple or Google TV when you read the terms of service these platform holders reserve the right to revoke that access on a whim huge l I mean luckily most platforms that have tried this have faced a backlash so severe that they had to backtrack but that is at best a temporary dou and I wouldn't count on it to last that last bit is a big part of why buying this stupid piece of plastic is so much better Sony is not going to be able to
enter your home and blend up your copy of morbius despite probably wishing that they could another big one is special features the behind the scenes from The Lord of the Rings box set literally set one of our production guys who happens to to be the one filming this video on his current career path that stuff is dead on streaming platforms I mean yeah some studios still produce short making of documentaries about their films that auto play as the credits role but they almost never feel as raw and plain
