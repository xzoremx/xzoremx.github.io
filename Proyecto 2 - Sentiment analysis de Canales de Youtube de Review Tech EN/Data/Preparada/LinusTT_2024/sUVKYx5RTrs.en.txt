welcome to Scrapyard Wars where Luke and I compete to build the best computer on a fixed budget and this year it's going to be interesting because we get to play with an enormous $800 including a hundred bucks to spend on whatever we want from our sponsor Jawa at the end of the week our setups will be put through the ultimate Gauntlet to find out who wins scrapyard Wars yeah go go go do I keep all the   what this year the rules are mostly the same except for one major change our
teammate can make pickups after the 5:00 p.m. cutoff we'll be bringing them in shortly we still aren't allowed to research or plan off hours nor are we allowed to use our industry connections or our influencer clout for deals which has become harder as the channel has grown and my face has become a bit of a meme that is why our first stop is a  unusual there's actually one more change this year you're not building just a computer you're doing a full gaming setup for $800 oh so like monitor
keyboard mouse yes oh I can do that desk chair desk too easy unless he defines chair I'm just going to show up with a log I don't need to Define anything cuz there's three parts to the score there's going to be Labs testing there's going to be subjective judging and then there will be a benchmark drag race at the end oh so you need to oppress the judges with your setup well that is harder than isn't it yeah oh it kind of gives you a box or nose we're going to put on a few
small pieces to agid you a little bit Yeah cuz that's what I need make you look a little bit more tired grumpy Haggard biker yeah and you're a biker you're probably getting all that hitting you clearly I'm a little ways off from my close up but that doesn't mean I can't start working on my plan of attack we know the first name's Duke what do you think for the last name I think you kind of mentioned offand a bit ago Sons of Anarchy there was like teller Dax Morrow Morrow Duke Morrow I like Duke
Morrow that's a good one you know what the end result for the makeup supposed to be have you given any thought to your identity as this finalized person not even a little bit it might be time to do that pick what bike does Duke Morrow ride I like that one okay Luke has a full Alias ready to go what I'm probably just going to cheap out and just be my grandpa boo you need a whole identity my grandpa's cool I have a whole identity I'm John I'm from the Prairies as is tradition we start by
scoping out the usual secondhand marketplaces Facebook has come up in a big way since the last time we did one of these craigsl is like dead now man looking at gpus over on Facebook right now I'm kind of wondering if my $100 on jawwa would be best spent just getting a decent GPU and then fighting my way through like crappy old Lenovo pre-builts that are local honestly so far finding the things on Jawa seems the easiest but I'm trying to make sure that I look everywhere we'll shop around a
6700 XT is like $400 Canadian Dollar on Facebook and as low as $240 us on Java so it's like $320 bucks wow oh yeah aside from pricing there's a couple talking points uh put the market in the hands of Gamers you can find parts pre-built systems new and used and they've got individually vetted verified sellers so that's probably what I'm going to want to go with so I can make sure that we get it shipped up here in time that's exactly right are we considering things like shipping cost
and stuff like that no no no no we're getting it like expedited so it'll arrive tomorrow they're not actually available in Canada they're making an exception for us I kind of wish they were though looking at this right now meet your teammate what's up brother name is Duke Meo Duke so I've got a bit of a bad update for you okay turns out um never buying your own computer components and not reviewing computer components for I think 5 years since the last Gra spred Wars means I have no idea what's going
on the what I've done is nothing well I have some good news okay I have a plan that I think will win us the game brother there's a whole bunch of mom and popop Tech shops or even just small Tech shops that do like small to medium businesses they have recycling piles oh we could probably just call them so get as much get like PC cases power supplies things like that when I was working at a place several years ago they were recycling eighth gens CPUs whoa I love this one thing that I was doing actually
was Googling around for recycling places because something that won me of scrap red wars in the past was finding free geek yeah yeah totally free geek is closed now oh yeah I forgot about that wo I like this deal what the hell is this Tower only 250 bucks core i78700 32 gigs Ram this is obviously a custom build comes with a tower cooler woah wo cic 520 wat power supply dude I should just go buy this I might not even keep all that stuff I like 4 days I can flip some of that stuff we're going to turn a
paperclip into a house let's go I'm going to be super formal in my communication I think that's going to be part of my Persona I don't have a lot of money what does he want to oh he wants to play fortnite I'm going to spell it wrong thank you John okay send message we're going to see how it goes apparently presentation is some amount of the judging I don't know how much like if we end up with kind of an ugly computer M my idea was that we hide it by like desk mounting the computer
basically and I have found a desk that had like cable management holes in it and all that kind of stuff that was free it says pickup available today so we should offer like now it's in Langley too so it's nice and close overdale this guy's like yeah just come by and pick it up so we will go pick it up today h this is interesting what the hell is a ryzen 54500 oh wait do I have a message back already I'm not a gamer you need to look at the specs and draw your own conclus
clusions sorry can you advise if this is the best deal you can offer me all right well he got back to me really fast that's a big improvement over the Craigslist days what do I want my angle to be I got to impress the judges if all I had to do was build a fast computer no problem who are the judges can we cater to the judges yeah I'll tell you the judges it's Nicole plof and Riley okay so plof we need a good Monitor and keyboard Riley is going to want minimalism I want to make sure that we
try to spend nothing on desk chair things like computer case stuff like that but we should still try to do cool things with it I should start figuring out what I'm going to expect to pay for like a desk I mean it's got to be free right oh it's free as things that I'm a little bit concerned about is peripherals and monitor Labs won't be uh testing the monitor they'll just be testing the computer but the the monitor will be more sub experience wao this monitor is 300 HZ for
$175 honestly you might want to even just send it that's really good it's a 24 in 1080p 1 millisecond IPS slow motion dude I can get leftover paint for like five bucks like if I like painted up the walls near my setup and stuff I think that'd go a long way there's one system on Jawa that's like really sick it's like legitimately pretty well specked out my my biggest concern was that's American Bic our budget I think that'd be like $800 yeah so you have to get like a free monitor free mouse free
keyboard free desk free chair res 400 bucks man there's some deals of course C Sonic Focus gm550 man will not come with storage okay that's what's missing on this buddy for 400 all right hi just sending some messages sending some messages High lus never better oh  okay it was the reverse of what happened when he shaved his beard off honestly things are going a little rough okay for team lonus and Sammy okay I found a couple of pretty good deals they are not responding to me oh I found one okay
deal Buddy needs 2 hours of notice but it's for a core i78700 which is okay yeah that's like worse than mine and I play games that run out of hamster wheel so what I really want is a ryen 3000 Series there's a couple good deals out there one of them I can call but I think it might be actually better if you place the call so guess what you're up now we need a store you're my daughter-in-law so that's why you're communicating for me okay I'm trying to buy a gaming system for my grandson I
guess he's your son then I'm 23 you could have a son yeah biologically speaking look I'm not saying you're a responsible daughter-in-law I don't have a lot of money I'm a pensioner okay you have reached mailbox number we're going to text I guess that makes it a little bit easier okay um okay go uh stand by what I mean you're good for now are you sure you're old man finger store should I type it off if we get the whole computer for free we could spend the rest of the budget just on ploof monitor
his current monitor that he has I'm down but that all depends on you getting it for free so why don't you call the tech shops yeah maybe I should and see if they have a Rec seconding pile they let you dig through this person's mailbox is full you can okay I guess we're calling somewhere else so Luke is also doing this right now you have reached mailbox number 64 hey there I was just calling I just heard back from uh buddy with the $400 3600 machine it's got a 1660 super in it
already we could probably flip that for a few bucks b450a Pro Max 16 gigs rip Jaws 3600 Focus 550 W power supply Serenity Now nice looking case Okay lots of nice looking fans and stuff will not come with storage exclamation mark that's fine we can find storage I worry that this place is going to know my voice though cuz I've definitely called you got me do it hi there bit of a bit of a long shot but I've just been calling around trying to see if uh any of the computer shops have like a
recycling pile or something if you've got anything you were planning on recycling if I could sift through it that would be fantastic yeah I could I could ask one of the the bosses would I be able to give you a call back yeah absolutely I I really appreciate it what was your name L uh duke duke duke yeah okay I'll give you a call back okay thank you holy crap What's Your Name dke by the way they probably know who you are cuz I've been there and they've talked about lmg so this might be a
little bit interesting I hope they don't agree to do it just because they might have a sense of who you are if they do it should be fine cuz it's free right not really oh I suspect it would be against the spirit of the competition I see but I'll try to be pretty convincing this buddy has no GPU in it okay but does have storage okay oh God what's this now I can help you out with that if you're not the most text having oh that's so helpful I am asking my daughter inlaw to have a look at your
listing for me she is quite knowledgeable no pressure though what do you mean no I put things together I've made one PC that's it you know how to graph data visualization right yeah I could do that on a MacBook what time would we be looking at I I don't mind this one ideally we should be picking up at least something today or it's going to be a big waste of Tom's time to make me up can we come in oh uh uh uh uh no pressure an hour can we come in takes an hour to get there 1.5 hours we're going to
immediately flip this GPU okay cuz we're going to pick up something else but we got basically everything else that we need here other than storage so we just got to find storage do we have we don't have one oh okay so you just wanted something else mhm where do you want to meet up oh God we're going to need like an outfit for me by then well we're committed now Sammy should we call Black laab Glenn that's the guy who uh we did like buying out the mom and pop tech shop give it a shot I'll give a call
we'll see if Keith answers they picked up my recycling last week ah okay yeah I'm going to ask him if he can do $25 off but I feel like I might have committed already am I going to be one of those guys that shows up $50 short and is like well do you want it or not no I hate those people I actually hate them I would be like I don't know this man someone just reached out to me so I'm not sure that's Luke they just low balled you they sound like a jerk pleasure doing business with you
that sounds very Boomer I know well it's what I'm going for man yeah no response from any of the tech shops I'm going to feel so dumb if we buy a 3070 knowing we can get the rest of the parts for like nothing I agree so overall update we're debating on buying a 3070 on jawwa and it is well priced on Jawa it is actually well priced uh compared to our local area right now but the issue we're potentially seeing is if we spend that little of our budget on a 3070 and we get the rest of the computer for very
cheap we could have theoretically bought a 3080 and so now we're trying to weigh our options of should we just bite the bullet and get the 3070 should we wait for for this one of the tech shops to call us cuz maybe they'll say yeah come look through our recycling pile well we could buy the 3070 hear me out do you think someone here wants to buy a 3070 we sell it to them for $20 more that is actually fine you I don't think we could sell it in in in the company but if we were able to
flip it on Facebook market like a day and a half yeah cuz it's it's showing up from java if we buy that stuff has happened by the way yeah it's just very hard let's see 3070 okay what's a 3070 going for 2300 wo wo wo $260 is this just like an amazing deal the only thing we're going to get that might be better would be if we could get a 6800 XT okay I don't think "we're getting that maybe a 6,800 XT what" about a 3080 equivalent AMD card that's what I'm looking for right now got it oh
man I'm I'm a little scared to just take the first deal I see on Java but like I think this is like the best deal if Luke doesn't get this I think he's like boned the thing is that like I feel like if it's the official store they would have tested it question mark that's true cuz that's like a big chunk of change R and we can't get it back still going with that then yeah I'm I think we're still going to go with it found 100 Herz 1080p 22in monitor for 50 bucks or we get that
monitor that we saw that super Overkill monitor cuz if we get a 3070 or 3080 it'll be able to drive it but then that monitor is 100 Canadian it was yeah it and it's all the Java money so we would only have 600 bucks left which then would be 500 for a 3080 so we' have $1 $100 for the rest of the system and peripherals there is a $75 one it's 24 in 144 that's sick isn't it yeah 75 bucks and then we have 25 bucks still on Java so spend it on that SSD what's the most we can get for the max price of 25
bucks we can get a 256 SATA or a 256 m.2 sheesh brother or we spend 28 so we go $3 US to Canadian and we get a 480 sat you want to do that I think that's that seems pretty good to me okay we need to find out what the cheapest SSD we can get is oh wait buddy here has tons of them okay no no we can yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so we can we can get them for 20 bucks Canadian locally now we're trying to make a commitment on the GPU so that we can have a pricing for the rest of the system but we don't want to
actually spend the money so we're going to ask someone if we can make an agreement to buy the card and say can we pick it up tomorrow with full intention to actually do that but by saying we're going to pick it up tomorrow we're buying ourselves the time to figure out if it's even technically possible so that is 100% the goal we're not going to try to bail on this person um but we want to lock in the deal $380 and 800 system is insane I can pick it up tomorrow is there any wiggle
room on the price smiley face I don't know if I'm deleting the smiley face I don't know if Duke Mero would send a smiley face oh sorry yeah you're Duke I oh I never checked my email whoo whoo whoo wo I heard back from this guy I'm 3 after 6 today okay original Craigs List oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay but it only comes with 8 gigs of RAM but it has a better motherboard it has a Quadro 600 that's like really old I think Quadro 600 is worth $5 where do you see 4500 u in the
posting I mean it says 4500 that's not a CPU wait what the H is a ryzen 54500 oh it is a desktop chip how okay with bending the rules are you we're okay with that what if we like bought this and then we went on like a selling spree over the next bit because I I think this deal is crazy okay like I think this guy has no idea what this stuff is worth there's five noctua fans the noctua fans are worth $200 I say we do it okay and then we sell stuff and then we have to sell stuff to get back under budget
okay Luke would do the same thing I don't know if we actually want to go with his name but hey young Mike such a stupid name what's up if I come pick up today at 6 can you give me $20 off see this isn't so much a budget management exercise as a cash flow management exercise because the jawwa cash hasn't left our wallet so as long as by the time the jawwa card arrives and the cash is back in our wallet by then then we're good okay right I didn't hear anything and I we'll allow it cuz it sounds interesting
okay okay okay okay between these two deals I think we're in really good shape because like Orizon 3600 is worth like 90 bucks there's all mental math which is not my specialty have you seen the tattoos wa you got one by your eye damn your nose is huge I can't get over the nose the nose is pretty huge this side is enormous yeah I really don't look that different I think if I put a hat on though yeah a hat would help here we go here we go we heard back okay sure sure sure 20 bucks
off we just got 20 bucks off let's go $20 is the difference between Victory and crushing defeat okay in scrapyard Wars $20 is the difference between cute desk and not cute desk that's true and it'll get us points with Nicole right cuz she has a cat right yes I'm still down your head all right let's do it I think you should do it you want me to shave his head you should shave his head why are we even why are we doing this at all does he need to be convincing as well is Linus's person also getting
disguised is that a no the problem is Elijah is actually kind of recognizable uh we do need to go to our first Port of Call very soon though here's what I'm thinking Sammy okay do you want to make a quick trip to the Valley Village we have a separate budget for clothes for our outfit okay you got to help me out here I'm fine if you try to actually style it you don't have to go straight bald what does style it mean I don't know do a lower tape or fade straight  know I already regret it I don't know if
this is the right time to say it I've never cut anyone's hair in my entire life if you want to see the uh the full you know uncut version of me brutalizing Elijah's hair uh check it out on Flow playay and if you're not subscribed there has never been a better time we're going to be releasing every part of scrapyard world a little bit early on the platform and that's on top of all the incredible content we have cooking at lm. g/f floatplane but wait there's more if you're itching for even more
scrapyard Wars goodness Jawa has an entire giveaway campaign running right now they gave us a sneak peek and I got to say you're going to want to check it out for yourself that's at the link below now back to the video sorry I'm a little focused right now but yeah check it out I appreciate him being focused oh my God that's a lot of hair I'm giving young Mike a buzz what does that say I don't want to this rip okay I don't want it to be like  something we're here at Valley Village
line is giving $50 in cash I was tasked to specifically get him a hat we'll see what embarrassing things I can put him in there's his named BJ but he wears socks with sandals at the office so I don't know how much worse it can get $ 13.99 we'll go with this I'm an adult but not like a real adult I think this one is more fitting of a boomer man with a daughter-in-law who's 23 years old old how much is this one $7.99 it' be really funny if we had a fedora his head's kind
of small isn't it maybe we do have to go with a cap then we'll go with this one it's very beige and sad pants are hard cuz the thing is like he's so short so I think getting shorts is like the safer option here khaki might work like he goes boating and fishing every once in a while he sold his house for $3 million "even though he bought it for 150,000 it" matches okay we're good you look like that could just be your haircut yes I did it I mean same with you I just look like I got you mentioned it I think
you said it well I just look older and like I had some bad decisions what do you mean great decisions now look here young man my God he looks way different than I do you don't look that different you look older we're we're hoping a a hat is going to be a big part of the sale I haven't I have not seen myself yet be fair you look older as well oh my God you just look a lot older I feel like you've maybe got a bit of Advantage here cuz people will be like nice to the old grandpa trying to
buy a computer for probably what I'm assuming you're going to say is you're like young gosh I never thought of that oh you just gave him advice no trust me he was going to do it anyways I'm buy a PC for my grandson yes yeah have you seen the neck one yet oh not bad actually I like that yeah it's good you should get neck tattoos no you know you can have hats from here right oh a pirate hook what Elijah whose team are you on you could also just wear a freaking helmet you know what that sells the look
a lot that I'm going to leave and get in my car no you want to go with like the Canadian flag the Canadian flag is really good this hat is definitely too small for me I think it was a child-sized  what your laugh is so distinctive though I got to not laugh found any good deals yeah actually I didn't nice I got no good deals nice all right see you later  you hi hi there honey give me a kiss wow that's actually like very realistic not bad huh no it's pretty bad how's it going I mean how's it going
young whipper snappers my goodness you young people it's inspiring seeing y all working so hard in here the visual change is actually people won't recognize you I think I've seen the other team and they look very much like the other team look at that Callin speechless dad well you have a hat but I bought you a dad hat which also might work we got to go basically like immediately so I'm just going to thr this is a shirt it still had the tag on it doesn't really matter what it says because I grabbed you a
sweater I grabbed you a sweater okay maybe we'll throw the sweater on and then I grabbed you like khaki shorts cuz I wasn't I didn't want to buy long pants and have them be too long because okay you know so good luck go I made sure that they didn't have weird stains or holes on them so thanks we are headed to Valu vage or Value Village to try to get the rest of my costume like the clothing portions of my costume Elijah is off to go pick up the desk and potentially other things from some Warehouse I'm
hoping he can come out with a desk and a chair now my eyes ain't what they used to be I I think we're I think we're going to turn right up there is that right all right what's this accent hold on hold on let me let me try again you should have gotten uh coaching from Gary I don't think any of these beat the Canada hat and I close enough to the  now yeah is it actually work yes we just get this and then I can check what shirt I have in the car and just go nice yeah well this is it yeah first deal am I
going to pass I hope so if you just like look down maybe hopefully he's taller than you so that's rich coming from you uh am I going to get away with this  sorry H um so we're yeah we're here to pick up the PC yeah you can come in oh than thank you very much um yeah it's upstairs it's there just like photos I'll log in you guys can take a look around make sure it works okay thank you great I'm going to have to take most of those drives out okay yeah no problem should be good to
go thank you very much we can just wait outside if that works for you I'll just wait here hello hi no problem take your time you seem pretty good with those machines uh yeah I've had a bit of practice here and there how do you find this that's a cool screwdriver yeah it is pretty nice I actually use it today to change an oil filter on my car oh oh where'd you get it uh from a guy called L hi mango your name is mango right sorry he's a door too salesman or no just online YouTube guy actually kind 
you but yeah I there four more do you have the cash thank you so 1 2 3 400 thank you very much one question for you when did you figure out who we were um I saw your car in the background unfortunately and it's a very distinct rap but the deal was not affected by real okay didn't really know until you guys come out here and saw the car okay tell me would you be able to tell I think the eyes are kind of a dead giveaway that's my makeup artist right there we we hired a a professional from
the industry to come in and uh that's the shtick this season it's a nice screwdriver you got there yeah it's been pretty good haven't lost anything hope thankfully that's okay there's bits available from from where from LT LT store.com that's right you better believe it you know what's funny we were like we saw the screwdriver he brought it out in the Box I was like M yeah how's the screwdriver that looks cool and then he was like yeah it kind of looks like you I was like we got busted
you know what as long as it doesn't affect the deal then it's legal yo that's pretty good do you want to know the best part they were literally across the street from the labs building what I've literally got in the truck and just went boom and they were like oh you're from lonus right I'm like yep it's free though cuz we already agreed to free beforehand the deal was already made the deal was made I don't want us to be cheating but yeah there's a little bit of sus stuff there's soundproofing on
the underneath of it and there's a bunch of like white splatters we can clean it yeah oh yeah yeah yeah no black lights one of the guys agreed to $500 for 3080 that leaves us with $194 there's a decent amount of systems available at around that price usually i5s i7s around like 7th eth gen power supply is going to be our issue some of these Brands I've never heard of so that does sketch me a little bit if they're like 7 years old throwing a 3080 on it might be a little oof because of the big spikes
right it does but if we have three of them it's redundancy each P power connector is a different power supply would that be three power supplies and then one for the motherboard one for the drive so we end up buying like five power supplies we go get a power bar and it's just part of the build you you have to have this power bar he's going to look at the computer at the end he's be like why are there five power cables coming off of this I just don't I don't know if it works everyone is saying don't do it in
forums but nobody's saying you can't do it the one we're getting recommends a 750 watt yeah but for a system with one in it like how much power draw is just as 3080 taking uh 320 watt according to Zotac site so we could get away with like a 400 watt you can't no way why no no I'm just saying just a 400 just for the GPU yeah yeah yeah yeah this we're we are fairly committed to multiple power supp we also need to be ready to kill our babies and move on from this idea Tom am I allowed to drink it's hard
though um just move got it all right should we have a look at what we scored okay yeah cuz I never got a close look at it cuz I was pretending to not know what's going on confused okay we're just going to pull over right here so we have a full system basically without storage right six core processor 16 gigs Ram this GPU is going to go cuz we bought that one on jaob already so what that means is Sammy we need to start creating listings for any of this stuff that we are not going to keep okay like now cuz
we got to sell this stuff I didn't tell you this but I'm $80 over budget right now okay the good good news is the total stuff that we're buying for $780 right is about "$1,150 worth of stuff okay however we're" probably going to have to sell it soon so we have to undercut ourselves and so "we have to sell it for less than 1,00" bucks [Applause] yeah how do you want to do division of labor here uh you take it out and I can make the listing with pretty okay you might have to dilate that a little so do
you want to grab pictures then yep uh the ram we're keeping I don't think we can afford this cooler the other system has a stock cooler so we're going to use that instead do do you do you so me do you you you got this she's got this I just want to get these listings up as soon as possible because coming in under budget at all is reliant on us selling at least some of it oh God this is definitely dirtier than I initially realized no judgment though no judgment okay are you ready to take the next
picture yeah okay do you want to grab this oh my God a snake kidding kidding okay so this GPU is going to go let's get the back panel off here you have Man Hands can you hold this yeah should oh you know what we should do though we should clean the goop off the bottom make it look shinier oh no don't touch that it'll get all over your hands forever should we post it right away or can we wait until I clean it up and make it look nicer no no we're going to clean it up right now we got this don't even trip
okay sorry yep technically legal what we're doing a little weird but legal weird yes there's also dust on the outside I'm working on it any luck is it working no you're breathing it all in next time you drink water it'll taste like dirt so let's put that on the dirty side okay she kind of cleans up pretty decent here yep oh I guess I'll probably write the posts or you know what I can help you wait do you get carick no nice so I can dictate when we're in the car and you can post okay
we got this hey wo wo wo we ended up with the hard drive that I wasn't expecting oh uh I told them we'd give it back to him if we found any storage oh for crying out loud it's the biggest one bloody hell Daniel that was his name right yep this power supply we're keeping so there's no point extracting all of this yet but the case is going to go I think I have enough photos I think this the photo is like on the Porsche logo yeah but then if if we try to get a better price they'll be like you don't
need that money yeah that and if Luke sees it he no it's us yeah we can bait Luke and then ghost him that's the best it's not actually about saving money first I'm going to clean this CPU this CPU is going to go we've got another one that's almost exactly the same it actually boosts a little lower but it's a weirdo 4500 that most people don't seem to have heard of so they're going for a lot less so I'd rather take the small performance hit and get the most money back possible
this CPU is one of the most liquid things we have it should be really easy to move okay do you feel ridiculous yet yes good that means you're doing it right hold on we might want to do this but this would be the sketchiest possible they have LT Edition knock to a fans it would be very hard for them to not recognize us Duke and was was it the young Mike or whatever what is it what is it AMD ryzen 54500 oh it's only a 430 W power supply do you think if we say hey no hard drive
no Quadro no power supply maybe in a case no case I mean you could go for it just be like 125 bucks posted 18 days ago that's a long time ago why isn't it selling that's one stick of memory maybe that's why people aren't buying it but like maybe the guy's willing to take the ram out too like hey brother we really just need the motherboard and CPU everything else can go away honestly we don't need the GPU hello we're back you forgot your hard drive yeah I was looking for it in
there and I couldn't find it it was in hard drive sled you don't happen to have the mounting hardware for that CPU Cooler for like other sockets oh I do and since I'm add it the motherboard box as well do you have the motherboard accessories I have both of those all right success awesome see you later have a good one man that worked out great oh look at that we've got thermal compound and everything we appear to have the full complement of mounting hardware for our cooler let's take a photo of our combo
okay oh my God okay we still got to get the case just going to do a quick wipe down don't worry we got this it'll be worth it when we see Luke's crying face at the end he'll cry real tears interesting take on a friendship look if you can't Delight in the tears of your friends then you know really what is there in life a lot of other things like food but imagine if you could season your food with Luke's tears this is the best place to do this there is no better method also the fact that lonus had his
LTT keychain out oh yeah that did did not help do we have everything we need oh son of a gun Daniel I feel bad but I really need the modular cables from this power supply hello we're sorry thank you very much thank you so much sorry to be a pain in the butt I promise not to knock on your door again I'll ring the bell okay it's older but it has more cores and more threads it's a ryzen 7700 so it's first gen ryzen that's pretty good but it comes with the motherboard 16 gigs of
RAM 750 W power supply that's amazing no G nor storage that's fine 170 that's amazing it's a it's 3.7 GHz turbo at 8 cores 16 threads do you think they're going to have eight cores they'll probably beat us on CPU I don't feel like they're going to they might I don't feel like they're going to get a 3080 this was listed 4 days ago and he says he's unable to test it unfortunately but like 170 and that gives us the rest of the system cuz it's 16 gigs of RGB Ram bro it's good I don't think it's
necessarily the best thing we could possibly find this other system that I found where we'd have to like hopefully get him to take some things out of it like the quadro and stuff which is way less likely would be better but it's less likely this one sounds pretty realistic like even if he didn't take a deal with us yeah it works cuz it's the whole it's still in our budget too so we should start moving on that this guy's in kitum do you want me to lowball them or do you want me to say hey before I
lowball I always open with is this available I can pick it up either or tomorrow yeah basically be like I'm committed I can come to you and get it I'm not I'm not one of those people asking for delivery and I have I can give you now our success hinges on selling some of the components that we' bought cuz we've got a lot of duplicates in our first two deals so Sammy is working on getting all of our posts up on Facebook marketplace right now we're going to land back at the office and
she's going to have about half an hour more overlapping with me where we can kind of plan out the rest of her night and then she gets another 3 hours so she's going to go pick up our next deal pretty much right away when we get back and then dude I have no idea beyond that Sammy We're going to have to figure that out yeah oh you can monitor if people want to buy our stuff the guy on the 13080 wants to pick it up after 6 p.m. tomorrow which doesn't work we were supposed to deliver the systems to Labs
at 600 p.m. can we get it after 6 p.m. today that is then for sure locking Us in to this and we're like we're we're in deep brother that means tomorrow is going to yeah but we we would have some time to find another system before then sure okay can I pick it up today okay uh title course s carbide 275r computer case I would go gaming case or yeah oh yeah PC or computers probably there search right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so gaming PC computer case yep let's go full SEO baby let's go
the dude wants you to pick up the 380 at 6:15 p.m. today yeah that's fine I can do it are we committing to it are we committing to at 3080 oh man I think this decision is going to make a break if we win gra your Wars right now yeah hi I have other people offering full price can you do 200 an hour ago oh my second deal backed off on the $20 discount I suspect the other person offering full price is Luke it's a really really good deal I'm a little surprised he found it though but at this
point I'd rather pay the extra 20 bucks knowing that I'll just have to sell a little bit more and know that he's not getting that deal it's a really good deal okay we got to focus in pretty hard on finding a system because right now we actually have no leads that have responded this guy selling a ryzen 5 3600 for 65 bucks but just the CPU so it's like we need to find you can find the rest of the platform let's go I found a motherboard for 120 which would put us at 185 so we need $10 for Ram and
power supply like maybe if I talk them down we'll get lucky but the guy who listed the CPU listed it 4 minutes ago message him try to talk him down it's worth it's worth we don't have anything right now we got to chase everything we possibly we can we got an uh hit on our listing which one which one on the CPU they're friends with 18 people including your wife on Facebook wait it's l Duke Maro yeah it's Luke what a piece of nice try Luke yeah got him oh okay I messaged the CPU guy and I said hey I have cash
and can pick up tomorrow he just responded with nice try Luke wait but now he knows it's us oh yeah maybe we shouldn't have said that his name is John who is this guy wait John stuck isn't that lonus isn't that lonus his name he saw it unlucky we should have wasted his time oh that sucks I thought we had a real bite how is I wonder if he doesn't even have it yet and he's like pre-listing it hi John buyer name would you take 40 cash for this for the CPU 40 bucks I can reply with 55 what did we
list it for uh 65 do you want to check what the other listings for the 3600 are on Facebook Marketplace cuz I think we're already the lowest other people are listing it for 60 let's offer him 50 we can do 50 yeah well don't say we oh oh what is check Facebook Messenger check Facebook Messenger which one which one which one check Facebook Messenger holy sh dude we're back in it brother let's go okay so that was the guy who had the rise 7700 and a 750 W power supply and 16
gigs of RAM for 170 bucks for 170 bucks meaning we will have 25 bucks as wiggle room to do like Mouse dude a 1700 is so good I think it's good it's a little old got another bite on the Corsair case I thought the case was going to be hard to sell you must have taken great photos Sammy yes maybe the Duke should have chosen to be a king then he would have a crown are you going to be Felding messages all night selling this stuff cuz like I can't believe how active these posts are it's it can't be real I
can reply to multiple people at the same time got that Zoomer energy love it do you just sell CPU GPU and case or do you have motherboard too yeah I got a motherboard we have a motherboard too no we sorry I can more or less guarantee you they'll have a better processor are they going to have a better GPU I mean they do have a better processor right now they have 3600 and they're selling it them a processor has me pretty concerned all right well well hold on so what all is he interested in can we add
it up because it occurred to me with how we're kind of pricing things according to how it is on Facebook and then like discounting a bit I don't actually know for sure that we're making money like I haven't checked you know this listing is being reviewed someone like report it did Luke report it that would be quite the I'm worried they're going to make the benchmarks like super lame like really heavy like storage and CPU based which like no one will ever do or use or care about you guys in the comments can
show how upset you are you would want a 3080 right right right wait we may not have actually uh-oh this may not be smart maybe that's why so many people are messaging us though maybe our pricing is a little bit uh too low little stressed this may have just been an exercise in doing the math swapping cash back for cash okay we'll be fine "though we'll be fine let's get the 1,700" that power supply alone is for our whole system let's just send it you want to pick that up tonight if possible yeah so
like 615 is the the GPU where was the GPU did the guy get back to you I don't know oh he hasn't responded after you sent that 20 minutes ago do you think he's faking selling stuff he he just read it right now I watched him I saw should I just ask him if he wants me to pick it up now I say I got off work early I Pi it up now okay so I need to do that yeah I got off work early I can go pick it up now I'm doing a lot of driving I'm driving all the way to Richmond to pick up a 3080 I'm then
driving all the way to quam to pick up that uh ryzen 7 system I need to go ask ACC counting to break this into 20s cuz I don't really want to show up and be like do you have 30 yo brother I got Hondos yeah day two starting I got the GPU yesterday and I got the full tower the guy did recognize me which was fun the haircut didn't work you were still okay with 170 though that's what you agreed on so I'm not using my influ fluence to get a deal dude I can't believe Tech tips I never thought this day would come
and we bought it for literally what he listed it at yeah cuz we suck at bargaining we haven't tested it yet we're going to test the GPU in the computer make sure it works we have $25 left we still need to get keyboard mouse mouse pad and chair we really need to verify the TPU works yeah how did it go the seller from Craigslist they haven't responded so I tried texting them again hopefully they'll reply they're not replying to me and I text so I went and I sat in his Lobby and kept emailing him
hi I'm here and then eventually I picked it up we have it right here I didn't get to like plug it in cuz we were in a Lobby otherwise I sat there and I hit refresh until 9:00 p.m. all night to see if we got more messages we didn't really get many so I'm a little worried about selling right now we need to buy more stuff before we can even sell anything though we don't even have storage oh so we're going to pick up storage at around 11 20 and we're going to pick up a keyboard at 11 we still need a mouse and
monitor and a desk and a chair a desk desks are free you just have to find one where the person is available so here's our 380 it's quite dusty but the guy told me he like just pulled it out of his computer to go do the sale so I'm hoping that's accurate oh crap is it long enough okay it's a snug fit but it does fit in the computer case that I'm not worried about we can always make things fit the power supply that it comes with I open it up it's 7 50 bronze from thermal take we're pushing the limits
here on like if this GPU is going to be fine didn't even realize we bought such new hardware still has the plastic peel on look at that brand new case basically Andy would be disappointed I peeled it but you know what that's fine all right let's power it   it kicked off a lot of dust do you hear that I do that fan does not sound healthy I think it's this front one hey there you go there it is ryzen 7700 8 core processor got our 16 gigs of RAM so our memory 2133 not the fastest definitely not the fastest
that's pretty slow but you know what we have 38 I found us a desk it's a solid wood desk oh that guy lies that's not solid wood oh saw that one those are MDF desks you know what at this point I uh think we might just have to go with it though can you throw in a chair yes but they are old that is okay I mean we might as well if we don't want it we can find another one so I need to go get that keyboard like now I should be done very shortly it's 40 minutes away that's gone
up since I looked it up I can message them okay I don't think we'll make it in time for the SSD Linus I may lose this one but damn it I'm going look good doing it he said 1110 is a late he can do got okay we got to go then I'm coming okay now oh God we need to get these products listed can I take apart a computer in the back seat I guess we're doing that hey look at that this Nas build has one of those old LTT Edition and ff12 fans oh hello good good how are you good um I talked with my boss so are
you available tomorrow by chat ooh unfortunately no it would have to be today that's the tech shop that we called yesterday calling back I wor that this place is going to know my voice though cuz I've definitely called what was your name L uh Duke Duke I think it should be fine okay awesome thanks sorry for sorry for being difficult here don't be sorry 11:30 this morning okay great okay so we might have some pretty major curve balls cuz that's the shop and they could potentially have a keyboard mouse
yes for us which would save us the 10 bucks some audio thing probably not but they would also probably have ddr4 Ram so if we really want to we could look at the speed and go to 32 gigs or we could faster memory might also be a possibility for a platform swap yeah this could like dramatically change things according to this board it says it has an mvme slot I don't see it though so I don't know if it's on the back or under the GPU so I'm going to pull this back out and take a quick look
oh yeah there it is okay cool I also am going to take out the ram I want to see what speed we have on this just so when we go look there maybe they have faster or if they have similar we could potentially go from 16 to 32 or something a lot up in the air right now so I took the ram out it actually does support up to 3200 so we could just enable XMP and hopefully get that full performance much better than 2133 or whatever it was how are the listings going I might have a buyer for a bunch
of stuff this pal guy might want Ram CPU case mobo and GPU okay he's making me kind of a low offer but um we are over budget right now and we need some money we just need the SSD we need a monitor monitor that's the thing literally doing the makeup on the way there this is quite funny I love this all right little bit of balancing all right banking right nice okay nice okay well we're here all right I misspelled outside three times okay well that's never better how do I look great never
better hi for the keyboard um I don't have cash on me can i e transfer you at all okay so it was $10 right and can I take a look at the C word thank you do you want to try it out do you think I'll like this one they have the WD gamer okay thank you okay it's good okay thank you uh let me know if you get it or it should be sent sounds good yeah thank you very much have a good day okay thank you I don't know he glanced at me a couple times but I'm uh not sure if he suspected anything uh I need the address
for the second place oh yeah for sure um sorry yeah for sure and can you let them know that we're on our way we'll be there around 11:25 hi this is Duke uh I'm on the road now the current ETA is 11:40 does that still work uh yeah sure I'll let them know you'll be there your name is Luke or Duke Duke Duke okay comes up as Luke so I was like did I get your name wrong oh yeah that's a weird thing with Facebook um I actually changed my name quite a few years back but Facebook sometimes just
doesn't it sends the old one I don't know okay yeah I'll let them know so you said you're going to be there 11:40 okay sounds good I never messaged him on Facebook that's caller ID yep yeah yeah I I was like no well we'll see how this goes we're good yeah I'm just going to powder it man buddy here wants $250 for ryzen 3600 with cooler and motherboard and the Corsair case and 8 gigs of RAM and the 1660 super and the cx430 power supply that pretty much leaves us with only like kind of
worthless stuff that's basically all we can sell that puts us back in the green though how much in the green by like 80 90 bucks I'm going to do 250 with the cougar case I'm going to say final offer so we keep the nice case from Daniel y it'd be nice to be able to move all of this to one person we don't have like a week to dick around selling to half a dozen different people where the hell is dunar Community Center he wants us to go all the way out to Vancouver that is in
the middle of nowhere I don't live in Dunbar should I offer to come all the way to Dunbar for an extra 10 bucks 10 15 15 I'm being a fair guy I'm a fair guy oh man we are bang on time for this guy let's go what is this for okay hello hello hi nice to meet you yes this is John all right hi yes can I get you to put in your e transfer no cash only oh oh we have a I have a change oh okay perfect so Jo I did test and sent you the uh the screenshot of the test you see on the
messenger yeah yeah okay thank you very much do you want to give him the cash yeah 80 bucks yes yes that's thank you I'm kind of in a rush too oh no worries thank you very much thank you have a great day than you okay thank you I'll walk slower for you hi young lady I um I don't think I got mated either of the last two no no huh was like a little sus cuz he like smiled a bit too much yeah I think he was I think he was just friendly hey Tom hey Tom right there buddy all right Rock On's all right
bye-bye let me find out if this pal guy if we got a deal with him have we confirmed a time with the desk guy uh he said anytime before 5 hell yeah that's super flexible okay that helps a lot where's he at uh somewhere in Su okay beautiful beautiful oh you know what we might pull this off all right so we are almost at the computer shop I am getting progressively more worried that they're going to recognize me but I will be going in with Lindsay uh who is my sister yes okay yeah second Sister We're
yeah and we're building a computer for our other sister's son our nephew Ryan Yes uh who is seven here's the whole I got to add in the the Hat this is the full Ensemble um which is not a word I will be saying while we're inside a biker would never say that word no I don't think so yeah well get up this is a get up yeah this pal offered $10 fee and meet in the afternoon I think we might have to take it I guess if that's the best we got that's the best we got and ruthless he's getting a great deal the
good news is his deal wasn't as good as mine so I'm still out ahead let's go one thing I will tell you about pal is he is not getting these knock to a fans I'm going to swap them out for the fans that are in that other system I got five knock to a fans in here he's getting zero of them oh my God see I was afraid of this our mass storage Mi is going to be a a mobile 2 and 1/2 in hard drive look look at the little thing hello we are here um I've got to leave you guys behind now but we're going to we're
going to go in there and try to get her done which is something he would say all right so keyboard mouse deskpad speakers speakers chair if they have a chair uh you could get a second power supply just in case y if there's Ram that's like similar speed or slow like slightly slower but we can get more of it that might also be yeah yeah okay and then platform swap if I don't know they're recycling 11th gens or something like you don't think they'll have an AMD they never we never
dealt with AMD when we built the systems unless they're recycling someone else's computer that is AMD all right let me try to hide the mics real quick yeah make sure mics are hidden I'm like so nervous I don't know why I'm not even going in there and I'm I'm the nervous one I'm wearing a wire dude I think I'm just going to have one wire coming down but I honestly don't think they're going to notice it I think him going in with Lindsay is actually going to help a ton too okay cool see
you guys in a bit you ready yeah we'll make it work yeah or we won't it'll be funny either way my name is still Lindsay right yeah yeah yeah yeah uh we're trying to make a computer for our nephew Ryan right now we're mostly looking for a keyboard a mouse maybe a power supply if there's one of those sorry I'm not 100% up on the terminology but the main parts I'm hoping that this SK is working ayzen system ryzen 1700 yeah let me see what this one is right underne here would you mind if I ripped that one
out would that be okay also some Ram maybe but it would need to be ddr4 which I think that might be three yeah some power supplies here all these are going to be 350 I don't have a screwdriver with me here um do you have one with you or I we can go upstairs and grab one from there too okay we've got another youth shelf upstairs with stuff I'll see if there there cool thank you very much okay they literally just like walked right in front of the car I know this guy knows me I used to come here and get
free Tech all the time so it's going to be a little sus unfortunately the the platform we currently have is ddr4 but I appreciate the the look oh nice okay awesome it was Box about this size and it just had a whole bunch of strap that's okay I appreciate it power supply and the mouse will will come in handy good luck finding the rest of the pieces thank you now that this is concluded I will say I noticed the LT screwdriver did you recognize me at all I do yeah might be a little easier
without the glasses without the glasses and the uh beard and the tattoos and stuff when we were about to leave he gave me a few looks that were like a little longer than they probably normally would have been and I could tell he was like trying to pierce the glasses a little bit and then we went inside and he handed me the LTD screwdriver and I was like well all right and I was like okay from here on if he offers anything like crazy then we I'm going to have to say no but we got
an old Power Man 350 W power supply I think this is like an IBM Thinkpad Mouse so all we need now technically is a a keyboard audio solution and a chair audio this mouse sucks we're probably still going to want to buy that combo set and we don't need the audio today is that right I guess technically not we could get the audio tomorrow so we're doing okay actually so I think we should head back and try to get this computer going all right I'm adjusting Lanes oh my God done woohoo hey there we go oh
just uh you know part of the life uh have to have a constant makeup person what's up brother here's the rundown our GPU arrived from java which means combined with storage we have everything to put together our final computer we've got the deal to sell most of our leftovers but it's way in Vancouver super far away and the deal sucks the pal whole offered $10 fee and meet in the afternoon I think we might have to take it I guess if that's the best we got that's the best we got with all that
said priority number one is to get this damn sweater off I'm like dying right now it's so warm okay let's get a system built have you ever built a computer before yes okay good build a computer go no kidding I'll help okay let's do this thing I have a gift for you oh these Jaa special edition screwdrivers get rid of this one this one's gone look at these beauti colors from our sponsor Jaa well I mean it's from us isn't it yeah we made it but we wouldn't have made it without their
colors thanks jwa we're actually going to be giving some of these away on Flo playe at the end of this and Jaa is also going to be giving some away so go to check them out online I'm taking all of the wao thanks Daniel and then let's get all these cheap fans out of here and then we're going to replace them with the noock twiz that are in the other case oh yeah that's something you can do Sammy do I also get a Jawa Edition screwdriver for now thank you wow lots of nocta fans oh yeah no Samy's got more
what yeah more fans oh I found us some speakers Sammy check out these speakers yo 20 bucks you smell like glue well you smell like we're about to get a good deal 20 bucks that's good thank you speaker guy 6 p.m. sorry you're doing great Sammy how is the selling going I don't think anyone else has messaged so when are we supposed to meet pal I haven't confirmed yet but this afternoon oh my God it's afternoon we do not want to get stuck in rush hour traffic today no I know it
doesn't really matter but pal is not getting these noct a fans we want the noct a fans question for you Ln are you doing Windows 10 or 11 well unlike some people I'm compatible with Windows 11 what do you know about the other system I know that I'm compatible with Windows 11 and they're asking about Windows 10 so I say we're on Windows 11 I don't know how to scoot this fan in it's really tight okay there you go I don't want to break anything no no you're good if you break it just remember this guy's
oh okay one thing I'm concerned about is we bargained with no one we tried with the gpus and they both just like no and those were a lot cheaper than the rest of the market we probably should have tried to bargain with 170 guy for the system but once he recognized you I couldn't bargain anymore and it wasn't worth not getting it at that point cuz we needed something we're we're going to lose CPU stuff we will I I guarantee you they'll have a better CPU lus is going to take a more
rounded approach I bet you his setup is going to be nicer in general I bet you he's going to have a better CPU and then we're going to come in with the like the club with nails driven through it of a 3080 you're like what's up you want to go big update we've got a new buyer he's willing to take the stock cooler instead of the hyper 22 but he wants the better motherboard but he's way closer and I talked him into taking the cougar yeah let's go so let's uh get this board out of
here because we're no longer using it okay and we got to get the CPU swapped and we got to get out of here and I got to put my beard back on when are we meeting him uh we're meeting him before 2:30 as soon as I told that I had another offer he's like well what's the deal oh all of a sudden he wants to negotiate you know what you pal in all fairness I respect the hustle I do respect the hustle I respect what we did to other people in previous shows and this one messages me he's like bro I
swear nobody keeps their word these days whatever man enjoy and I'm like if he backs out I'll let you know he goes he ain't oh so now knows what a good deal it is f you pal one more this cooler is going with this board this CPU comes out though so that's our 4500 and then our 3600 is going to go in here you could throw like a tiny bit more goop on there but the goop that's on there is probably fine you know what here here goop transplant oh yeah should we take a photo of it before you put it on no he
he wants to boot it up while we're there he wants to see it post which makes sense so what I was thinking was oh that's a lot whatever so what I was thinking was we will just build it can we try to post it before we leave yeah do we have another Ram stick he gets one ram stick oh he gets one ram stick why am I you're building his system oh I see uh these fans um you can just basically find anywhere that looks like that and just kind of plug them in uh who is I don't think we're going to do Cable
Management on this bad boy nice got it perfect thank you hard dri is in everything's in the reason I want to see this post before we go is that if for whatever reason this system does not work now is the time for us to tell hey look sorry uh we can't spare the motherboard or whatever you know this is mostly Daniel's system anyway we've got his Ram his cooler his motherboard it's just the CPU from the weird Craigslist guy all right okay all my fans spin that's a good sign GPU fan spin thank
you Jawa show me an output anytime buddy it's okay sometimes it takes a minute or two no HDMI signal from your device going into standby mode I wonder if it needs a bios update well we're going to have to gamble we've got to go meet the guy let's make sure that this one posts Now's the Time oh there we go uh let's power it off here's what we're going to do Sammy we are going to do the world's fastest bios update I need that CPU this CPU the one that's in there so here's what I want to see I want to see this
motherboard post with a definitely compatible CPU all right not stressed not stressed it's still not posting no it's stuck on CPU are you kidding me oh no no no no no this is bad did we plug it into the G power supply correctly yeah come on come on come on oh I think it's doting stuff it's doing stuff oh thank God okay okay I am sweating absolute buckets right now and Flash come on come on come on come on no no this is fine everything's fine what time is it at 5 to 2 we're still going
to be okay but we have to go like now hey here we go yeah so the BIOS on this board is from 2020 so that's why it "wasn't posting with this 40,000 series" chip just hadn't had support added for it yet this is good let's take a moment and talk about one of the great features of Jaba if you want to skip the hassle of listing your GPU for sale on a Marketplace you can sell it directly to Jaba to help offset the cost of your upgrade hilariously after all the negotiations with the guy that we're
selling this one to we actually would have gotten a very similar offer from Jawa so we could have just saved the trouble check out ja. and you can also participate in the giveaways that they have lined up for scrapyard Wars thanks for sponsoring this serious Jawa what's R ta Sammy uh 17 minutes plus whatever a few minutes so it should be 20 hell yeah here it is I need to see it post with this chip this is it this is where we find out if it posts with the 4500 I mean the compatibility list says yes
theoretically it's fine yes okay let's go the t-shirt's not great literally says LT on it or he just doesn't know who we are this is it hi fur the PC I'm just going to go into task manager and yeah I just plug in my mouse oh yeah no storage right no so it's not going to boot into task manager it'll just be the BIOS but it posts yeah yeah it looks good to me sounds good okay thank okay thank you very much have a good day thank you have a good day uh young man do you uh do you know lonus Tech tips
yeah oh really would you recognize them if you saw him wait oh away do you want to be in the video are you serious yeah wait really hi bye I always thought if I saw you know I see you see them in the video not recognizing like oh if I saw them I would know now I don't we got him I didn't it's fake dude I'm not this old B what are you trying to say right now that went about as well as it could have possibly gone Tom you missed it but this was someone who regularly watches the channel watches the podcast
literally knew we were doing scrapyard Wars right now he's like I hope and still didn't make me very good good work man so what's our next stop to pick up the desk right we need the truck we going we're going back yeah we got to go back we'll pick up a chair and lunch and then come back and then at 400 p.m. it sounds like we're going to pick up the keyboard mouse keyboard mouse mouse pad okay while Luke is out getting some more stuff I was taking this to the shop to give it a dust and holy crap I am glad I
did this is nasty and a fire hazard oh my God okay so we got the chair it's in the back we strapped it down I don't know how excited they were to see Duke they said nothing zero words when I got to the door I picked it up said thanks still no response left nothing but hey we got a chair there we go a little bit better there's still a tiny bit of dust in there but I don't want to take the air compressor too hard cuz it'll spin that fan this is more than clean for kind of this top down look here and even
just from the back so I think we're going to be good there we made a decision really early on because we were trying to get things shipped on time from java where we were going to get a standard SATA SSD because we weren't sure what platform we were going to end up with and if it was even going to have an m.2 slot or whatever else but that's not like a normal problem that you would have if you were doing this we're actually upgrading because we found that the best SSD option that we could find
was an m.2 off of java anyways luckily we've we've been able to do a bit of a swap there we found this Patriot p300 on Jaa which was great we unfortunately can't get it in time to Canada but that's okay the judges deemed that this Intel 660p is more than equivalent enough for us to install in our system that way we'd actually have a system to turn in today thankfully I think that SSD might actually like save us saved one of our benchmarks I I still don't think we're necessarily going to win
that one they might have a better platform they have a better one with like more cash or or or something we'll still lose almost certainly all the other CPU bound benchmarks but hopefully we crush the GPU once enough and I hope they let us put R tracing on cuz if they let us put ra tracing on we will destroy certainly whatever they have 100 are you nervous you look nervous no I'm not nervous you look super nervous it's ddr4 right yeah you know if it doesn't work we can just plant some like
thermite in there and when they go to start Benchmark we just light it all on fire be like whoops as part of our promoting things that are available on LTT store.com each team got one of our PTM 7950 phase change thermal pads these are a great thermal pad material from Honeywell that performs really really well super easy to apply you don't have to deal with any kind of liquid metal type nonsense it's non-conductive and we're going to use that to get really great temps on our CPU but I'm also
considering maybe putting it on the GPU is it worth it to tear the cooler off this thing what's our budget so we got 130 bucks monitor mouse mouse pad desk chair and everything else this is so doable I messaged someone with a Logitech mouse earlier did I hear P oh he's available from 4:30 to 5:30 how much is this guy 15 bucks for a Hyperion 402 maybe ask Buddy if he has a mouse pad can you well he's only available from 4:30 so we need to go pick up the desk okay first and then we will go to
Mouse guy well 15 bucks for a mouse pad or for a mouse right I was going to tell you I wouldn't normally bother to repaste a GPU this new it's probably fine but knowing that the judges are going to be looking at temperatures I'm going to repaste this thing Ben Q 144 HZ he's willing to take 70 24in monitor comes with DVI cable and power cord DVI cable might be a bit loose but that monitor might be uh DVI only for high refresh rate as well it's discontinued uh specs DP 1.2 let's just do it I can
stop looking at DP to DVI adapters but we have to pick up the the desk first if we want to leave we have to leave basically now grabbing the other end of  me how bad is it it's fine nothing nothing broke okay that was fun pencil's downtime today right for the computer hoping for 5 no no you'll have the computer before oh yeah yeah that's fine six is fine I'll have the computer for you before we go out again yeah ideally you and Luke will go together to hand the computer's off we have like four
stops to make in the next couple hours here we need to go now but but Windows update okay Windows update this guy's down for another $5 thank you so much negotiator nice you the best period it's possible this hard drive does not work Sammy you dropped it hey sorry yeah it's definitely not detected I know that much I mean we don't need it I don't think we need it as long as they're not installing too large of games how much is our SSD our SSD was 20 bucks no but like how much store 256 oh that's fine
should be okay can you swing by and occasionally Windows update yes I also haven't put the latest NVIDIA drivers on I can do that other than that she's tuned let's go I feel like where Sammy is really going to come into her own as the the superior assistant is tomorrow when we're setting everything up to be aesthetic cuz Elijah's got a lot going for him he's pretty techsavvy very enthusiastic but aesthetic sense Sammy you got him right yeah so casual all right we are off to our last pickup of
the day we are trying to get a keyboard mouse and mouse pad combo for 10 bucks then that'll leave us with just an audio setup that we need to get so we're hoping with you know basically the entire day of tomorrow we're going to be able to pick up some free speakers or something from somewhere I won't have the makeup tomorrow hopefully whoever wants to sell it to us won't recognize me all right well Luke and Glenn are still out I am going to attempt to enable XMP we'll change that to XMP
profile one let's see if our computer boots again now it's starting up again which is good oh maybe not oh oh oh oh come on bios okay that's good good uh memory 3200 look at that this is getting me excited I've been very stressed just trying to get everything installed and working like I'm I'm confident it's going to boot and I'm confident we're going to be fine but it's just I'm still nervous yeah so we're on like a 2017 bios that's not great let's update this so we got back from the keyboard
mouse and mouse pad I think it's a win uh I I won't show you all the stuff now because of like dangers of driving but ooh that doesn't sound sound that great actually it's definitely like a cheap no back plate look at that kind of like knockoff mechanical keyboard but it's a mechanical keyboard technically and the mouse is another one of those kind of like it looks like maybe like a final mouse or something like that it's not and we technically have a mouse pad so it's okay stuff
considering we got it for 10 bucks I'm very very happy with it Mouse guy I was like would you go down to 10 he left me on red I said okay no problem problem I'll still come pick up around 5 now just where the devil are we going Sammy this is like a strip mall yeah it's a business they're giving away desks and chairs and they close at 5:00 p.m. wait oh my God that would be hilarious this is my realtor's office no way what we might get an opportunity to see if I can pass to someone who knows
me reasonably well hi um we were told to come here for a desk to pick up let's we'll grab the desk first okay yeah it's pretty heavy uh does uh Ben still work out of this office yes he does is he here right now uh he let me watch my hands all those put that corner right there yep there we go so the green one's Greener but that one's kind of better condition yeah I think we should take the one in better condition take this take the gray one okay uh do you mind if I see if Ben's around sure you can go
okay thanks so  okay hello yeah uh the ladies downstairs said you were giving away some desks I just wanted to say thank you hey you're welcome hello recognize me yet he bought a house from you oh more than just that the getup is we're shooting a video this is one of my team members we're filming you sorry Ben sorry to Ambush you like that anyway thanks for the desk oh you're welcome all right see you later Ben oh the look on it face it's hilarious so Ben sold us the the lmg office he represented us
when we bought the lab yeah he sold me and Ivon our first home no we we we go way back with Ben wait DVI out on the board yeah PS2 it's like first gen ryzen bro it works okay oh okay oh you want the best part to get the board updated to the latest bios I had to do five bios updates cuz I couldn't jump from the original it was on the original actually it was on 2017 but it booted we'll see how it goes there is one fan on the Zotac that is off balance and so when it stops it'll
get lopsided and then when we reboot it picks up again but I can fix it by just like kind of giving it another go should we just tape it so it doesn't ever spin so here's where we can really game the performance that Labs tests is not final performance as long as our system is stable when we drag RAC it it's fine the things that Labs testing that are final is things like noise so we take the tape off tomorrow yes I'm so down pull the  out uh well this is just cyber Punk being cyber
Punk starting to take off dude we are averaging 60 FPS you murdering innocent civilians yes that's what that's a mentality we need in scrapyard Duke good training young Mike we got to use that on the streets what quality setting is we're on like Ultra at 1080p that's pretty sick that is pretty loud though and I don't think we're going to be able to eat side panel's not on either sure yeah that's not better at all is it kicking off a lot of heat no and the air volume is also very bad
yeah these fans are pretty rinky dinky should just taken that whole system from stratum yeah pulled the fans out of it cuz having no fans in the top too is like kind of rough you going be able to mess with fan profiles and stuff too yeah I mean our GPU is getting up to 87° 88° maybe we shouldn't mess with fan profiles yeah CPU is at 50 our CPU is like fine actually taping plan was fun yeah but when it's cranked up that was on Q yeah wow when it's cranked up the fan is fine and honestly
I think we might need it yeah let's just let her be loud she's just a loud computer cuz I think people got to realize like gpus are loud pushing can we steal some of the sound foam what happens if we like I think it just is loud though yeah I don't think it's going to help that much yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to game but we got zero minutes left so I think we just got to kind of lus isn't back yet so you got bit more time a couple more minutes yeah we're ready and he's late
that traditionally comes with downsides I'm just saying what the downsides are varies I don't know there's been crazy ones where was like 10% every 10 minutes or something every 10 minutes over the deadline was minus 10% I believe to your score sort of depends on how late he is like if you're like 5 minutes late it's like who gives a but if he shows up at 6 kind of a big deal I saw I messages on being asking what the UTA was so typical lus always late y I gave them permission to pick
something up later but I told them that they had to be back at 5: to do this so they're late for that part of it I said Sammy could pick it up till 6 cuz I technically they're on 10 till six I might just send you and Sammy for this pickup oh man like now I'm negotiating with David apparently we don't have enough storage for all the benchmarks maybe we should have looked at what the Benchmark requirements were okay that's not going to work for tomorrow he says oh man I mean uh can we
get a random hard go we have to get it done by today I don't know what's going on yeah how are we going to get another Drive I mean we can afford it yeah yeah I had no idea we were going to need more than 256 gigs so it's this complex here hey what unit was it we don't know where where this what unit this guy lives and he's not responding so the mouse deal is dead I guess so bummer now David's calling me hey David how are you I'm not going to lie I still have not looked at
the Benchmark requirements I suppose it mentions that we need some amount of storage it's not specifically specified that you need a certain amount of storage um then I guess we won't get anything docked for that that's not true hold on hold on just a gosh darn minute here if it's not a requirement it's not a requirement uh it's an implied requirement that the benchmarks need to be installed you can't have an implied requirement sir is the problem that your drive is broken yes my drive is broken
but I had one working drive so I figured I was in good shape your drive Works what which one the 750 I just plugged it in and it detected right away really ohe just replied sorry well then that's great so we'll use the hard drive so what I had intended to do actually was set them up as tiered storage but we can delay so Luke can go hand his PC in they can start the testing on his then when you get back you can set up the teered storage no I don't I don't think I'm going to be able to cuz to set up tiered
storage you have to install to the hard drive can you just tell me what the benchmarks are and then uh uh I can pull it up just like you could have based on the document I sent out earlier today we have never had it in the past that you have to have all the benchmarks on the drive at a time so if that wasn't explicitly in the rules I expect there to be no penalty for this and the fact that I happen to have a working drive it turns out that's a bonus did you really think we were going to all stand around
do that or are you just playing a game uh to try and win we've done that before no I'm serious sto the amount of storage unless it's explicitly laid out is just whatever it is and you just install whatever you need when you need it when we've tested in the past okay that's what the subjective scoring is for is bring your demares there that's going to be up to the judges but yeah it will affect the subjective scoring yeah yeah that's fine no no I knew that um so David put whatever the most storage
dependent ones are on the SSD and then put everything else on the hard drive I guess okay sounds good all right thanks David we doing this thing how much was it 15 hello Mouse guy here's the mouse oh thank you great do you think he'll like this yep lots of buttons gamer yeah it's good it's my ex-girlfriend's oh oh sorry to hear that no no no it's fine oh then I'm glad to hear that yeah I built a computer for her and everything so uh so 15 yeah okay how did you learn to build computers it's pretty
easy like honestly if you watch on YouTube it's super easy to do what's like a good Channel and we got to build one right now so oh really yeah just what would we look up you think like honestly uh NCIX will do for like a 100 bucks too if you're like very unsure about like what you're doing no good Channel sir I don't think NCIX is in business m Express oh okay what was that channel that uh that that you knew uh lonus techtips oh okay no lonus is he's really good oh okay really yeah I heard
he's from Vancouver I think he's in Lang yeah it's a really small world yeah yeah okay thank you would you want to be in one of Linus's videos I mean I think you're wearing his shirt right now so really yeah really look like him yeah do I do I look like him yes you do are you sure yeah okay how long did it take you to recognize me I actually thought I I recognized you pretty early and then I noticed the shirt damn the damn shirt I had the sweater in there we've been running around today man thankfully I
think that SSD might actually like save us saved one of our benchmarks so it'll take a second to cook up cuz that's just what steam does our disc usage is climbing we're at 627 700 to dude I'm so happy with and like our CPU is unpacking on all threads dude if they have to download to that hard drive yeah they're screwed they're  brother okay so we're heading to our next protocol I'm not in David's good books right now I'm kind of afraid to ask him for a favor but we might need to
be owed to pick something up a little bit after 6 today it's 5:30 L is still not here it's a little ridiculous like honestly probably doesn't even matter for the competition but I just I just want him to cook we did it you were ready in time we crossed the Finish Line I'm proud of our child I'd be happy with this computer me too do you think that you have the better system when compared to lonus it's always hard to tell we saw a CPU that he was selling knowing how he tends
to approach these challenges I think he'll have strong points that are weak points for us and I think we'll have strong points that are are weak points for him so I really don't know how it's going to come out our strongest point is GPU our weakest point is everything else but our weakest points aren't like that weak like the CPU is pretty solid we were running some stuff like in cyberpunk we had no CPU bound issues even with the 380 I guess we'll see how Labs deals with it cuz that's going to
be the yeah the real test it'll suffer in some areas I suspect he has a better processor I think that'll be our hardest Point have you guys put any thought into the Benchmark you get to choose because we know we're CPU Limited we're going to definitely be avoiding picking those games we don't we don't want to do no Counter Strike that's what we're currently thinking probably Tomb Raider if I remember correctly from my days Tomb Raider scaled really well with CPU and GPU but and GPU is the big important
part of that and I'm guessing because you are running a 3080 you want to have your settings cranked high resolution we would love to do ra tracing on everything we just want to put that out there right now it's 2024 you should just have ra tracing I don't understand why this is even a conversation any amount of time of our lives spent without ra tracing from here on is a so I I believe Tom's Hardware said it first what is life without ra tracing yeah exactly it's time to hand your
system in for testing all right here it goes oh boy don't fail me now hey there brother hello m m Miss David hi I can hear you now okay we're going to arrive at our second last stop for today at 6 your second last stop at 6 well that's what I was going to tell you is it would certainly be convenient for us to do one more stop today after 6 but we don't need to but we would prefer to do our last stop today in costume which has a clear content benefit and then take a small time penalty
tomorrow yeah fine sure all right that's about the best outcome we could have hoped for Sammy yep and what are we picking up at this spot again uh monitor sorry I just have a hard time hearing hi uh we're here to pick up a monitor uh you can come on inside oh thank you hey sorry it's SC through the garage oh sorry Hi good thank you so I'll just take this or do you want to give him the cash oh thank you and then again like I was saying though the cord is a little bit finicky so like sometimes you'll
notice that it'll cut out in and out so um we have another one I thank you very much have a great day no worries take guys thank you take care take care I don't think you recognized us no I don't think so um shoot Sammy didn't you say this one had display port yeah we looked it up uh I think it's a different model oh doesn't have display port this will be interesting I think what might end up happening is we might have to get a display port to DVI adapter if we want to run at 120 HZ so we'll have to see
how it goes shoot this may have been a miscalculation this monitor but that's okay that's okay overall overall it's going to be a really good package we've got a monitor wait wait are we at Luke's complex holy we are at Luke's building right now for our last pick up of the day this is Luke's response here hello there that's it right there thank you I just don't use him oh sure so there you are as long as someone can use them then oh great thank you okay I really appreciate that no worries all
right take care yeah okay all right thank you not so is a Second Glance some nice little edifier speakers 20 bucks let's do it we made it our last pickup was at 6:30 so you can penalize us however you see fit well how do you think you did your system's basically complete we had a few options for configuration we almost ended up with a 3600 but we ended up with a 4500 ryzen processor because the speed was almost the same and the price that we were able to get flipping our 3600 was better cuz
the 4500 nobody knew what the heck it was we got our hands on a 3070 for what I thought was a pretty good deal 16 gigs Ram XMP worked just like that needed a bios update in order for everything to be hunky dory but I think it's a great system for the price overall I still don't know how much we paid for it well we'll uh probably set some Ed parts and we'll find out for ourselves but our first inspection so far we did open it up we're actually quite surprised to see oh okay Secret Surprise well what's the
point of me talking to him I thought he was supposed to tell me how my system's doing you should have read documents I sent you I'm building a gaming PC we shared a test plan we got input from everybody on how to best break or sorry test your system it's a great gaming system it's a great gaming system for gamers I guess we're going to find out tomorrow thanks for watching this [Laughter] video it's day four the systems are done they're tested although there is still time for us to tweak them for better
perform yes there's still time to tweak them but the big Focus today is going to be on the setup which is going to be a big Advantage for us except for one small problem we're going to have a little less time today yes that's right they were so late yesterday we're going to delay them by the equivalent amount of time you can penalize us however you see fit for the next hour these two are going to have to play board games oh no I like board games the real punishment is because lonus didn't read my
instructions yesterday I'm going to steal all the instructions from every game what do you mean read the instruction please no yeah no I'm not going to take it you pulled in the parking lot at 700 we were told we done at 5 you were 2 hours late what a joke this whole thing's a sham I don't like it when dad's argue you know what realistically we don't even need the time we got this does that mean we get to go you're good to go you're free yeah no punishment okay we're going to go you
got to grab the monitor you got to start clocking the 1700 let's get going might want to use another chair just to keep this one in good condition cuz the wheels broken so Co names the only Clues you're allowed to give is one word at a time for example like model you could be like train sure this is going to be too easy have you seen how well we communicate I have not they communicate so well at being late who this is the monitor we got dang thanks Jaa is that a high-end mechanical I'm
just trying to taunt them with our mechanical keyboard right now sport three sport three one of them has to be Cricket yep one of them has to be dance yep and one of them's got to be Stadium yes let's go I noticed your uh Cable Management isn't particularly nice so I have a gift for you which is the magnetic Cable Management Arts oh nice LT store.com this is a actually nice kit there's another layer too there's stuff below it w observe for two well watch yes and spy yes yes let's go we had a
little bit of a revelation I was trying to type in Steam and it wasn't the smoothest experience so I've opened a  it's registering like 30% of the keys I am not happy right now one of the judges is aob so that's definitely going to come back and bite them I just tried our first overclock and it crashed when rendering I'm going to try adjusting the voltage on it and see if that'll help this is my first  overclocking I've never overclocked before I'm glad this is news for both of us
so are we done our punishment now y you're free to go I've had far worse punishments should have had far worse punishments got them deal with it Luke oh I will everything can be ready for the judges at 2:00 p.m. 2:00 p.m. I thought we had a full day today they'll show up at 4:00 then no problem when are we going to judge and Benchmark and stuff are we staying till like midnight no this is the last day lus oh what you go so we need to get the mouse pad and leave a tuny under the guy's mat yes
let's figure out where we want our desk this is an option okay I think we can just leave it like this that's also an option I like this really with the lamp and the wood how much of like the space are we allowed to use to help with our aesthetic here you can't take items from the sets and use them on your desk but if you want to put stuff elsewhere around that's fine wait but they have the cute Corner that's not fair oh we didn't even think about using that thanks lonus yeah the cute corner is off
limit if we can't use the cute Corner we should just try to use that corner I just don't think we should be able to use anything to be honest it should be like the desk right here what kind of food is on this side panel but I'm going to remove all of it I'm going to double check our budget don't we have to figure out an adapter Sammy didn't you say this one had display port we might have to get a display port to DVI adapter if we want to run it 120 HZ so we'll have to see how it goes um I'm going to plug it
in and find out for sure we have 30 $30 remaining I'm thinking we hit up a mini so cuz it's actually kind of close this one's a Guilford also I think if we just got a Guilford straight up yeah there's a bunch of dollar stores there and stuff okay how we doing we're holding at this now 3.65 I mean it's a lot better than it was it's better than three and it has crashed yet kind of expecting more but it's a good idea to find a stable good place you will also get a care package
of magnetic Cable Management Arches from LTT store.com very nice so we can use that to make sure everything looks really clean aesthetically do you want it facing forward facing forward probably all right cool tilt this a little little bit so that you can see absolutely cuz we've got this expansive desk see these guys are all sign language whispery We've Got Confidence that's why we talk out loud about how freaking awesome our setup is we're just bored cuz we're already done uh-huh sure I
have a question for both teams did you read the judging rubric nope nope by the time you sent it to us we already had everything procured so it's not like we could well let me help both teams out by telling you how you will be judged by the judges so there's going to be four categories there is Aesthetics worth 25 points there is sound worth 10 points and that's partly the PC noise but also how good the audio will be there is stratagem or creativity as I like to call worth 25 points so judging how
creative is a setup how neat are the solutions and then Effectiveness for 40 points so how much would you like to use a setup and that's combined into a sweeping score and that scoring metric I like to call the asses score the asses score yeah aesthetic sound strategy Effectiveness and then a sweeping score I might have these for free I have a bunch of people I'm talking to right now this is the one that I think it's these were LG speakers I assumed it would work on a computer I saw a picture
on the back that's speaker wire I think the person messaged me by the looks of your profile you seem like a funny guy and I appreciate your joke offer but honestly these are kind of muffled and junky speakers not anything close to what I thought when I got them if you want them you can have it for free but then no refunds they're not taking my $2.7 very seriously okay so we are going to go pick up some speakers but as we've been driving my phone's been popping off with messages so we might be able to
pick up a keyboard while we're out as well there's a few free keyboards around we might have an option do you want to grab the peripherals you know what for a $10 keyboard it's not the worst oh yeah just needs a little bit of clean up and then it's good to go honestly it's not even that bad it's not that bad there are no weird gross fingernails in there yeah maybe we focus on other priorities all right so we're just going to Guilford now um I guess this is kind of we're going to set things up right do
you want to plug everything in and make sure it works first it wouldn't be a bad idea yes yeah so here we go just confirming Labs didn't break our computer real quick here let me oh yeah good call we could still replace this if we need to okay the whole keyboard works and mouse too this is actually the first time we fired up the mouse it probably won't track well on that so no it's actually doing okay okay great I did a bit of a goof I thought those speakers looked like computer speakers those are
home theater speakers they have speaker wire connections but that guy was awesome gave me just a bunch of extra stuff for free one of those things is this he said it's just like some piece of junk he got off AliExpress said it barely works and massively overheats but I will let you know there's left and right audio inputs so with a Y adapter we can run these speakers oh my God we're on our way to a dollar store SL cool kitchy stuff store to pick up some things to beautify our setup a little
bit we've got a $30 budget basically to get a mouse pad and beautification question for you Sammy yes seeing how much of the score is audio right do we need a mic we can try to find something at mini so and then our worst case scenario if we can't get a mouse pad for a decent price is we just drive to that place and leave it to the under the guy's mat yep hopefully he still has it out yeah yeah yeah all right oh my God this is not that cheap though dude this is the Branded stuff this is officially
licensed so it's more expensive I see Care Bear's battery bank man that 30 bucks is not going to go very far dude maybe there's a dollar store in here there is a dollar store here we'll see what budget we have but I think Dollar Store candies can be pretty good you're not wrong you're not wrong one thing I was a little concerned about was that strip yeah it's like okay yep we're talking about the same some kind of like sticker think of just like whatever this is like a piece of ribbon or something
across the front there but then this is a little wide okay you want to just go with the silver or the go with the silver that's a cute little basket yeah for $150 not bad this fit you I almost oh $1.75 oh that matches our chair too yeah we'll go with this that's the one is that our candy dish or is that something else that's our candy dish oh yeah I was going to look up USB microphone it's $10 for a Blue Snowball ice but we we have an hour and it's a kitum that's close to here okay here's a
black Blue Snowball for 20 bucks I mean how badly do you think we need a mic it was like a quarter of the score for audio you're right yeah and like we can no no CU we can still get this some candy and some candy and a microphone maybe hard mints for a dollar wait did you just say hard mints yeah okay Boomer maybe we do like these I'm like hey your previous candy was for Boomer she goes here let me improve that with worther Originals literally my grandfather ranchers my grandfather is the only
person I've ever seen EA worther original Jolly Ranchers are a good B oh wo wo wo $10 Blue Ice uh just responded to me I pick it up right now what is your ETA can holy crap to 10 bucks anytime is fine just let me know before you come okay we sent the money money sent I sent you my money please respond did you ask him if it's fully functional I mean I didn't really read the listing like new okay great please hold yeah yeah yeah I got you hey where was the address for the mouse pad oh she left
I'm on my own now well uh it was nice having a teammate while it lasted super lucky I guess she just wanted to get rid of them but we got a keyboard and headphones I don't know if any of it works there was no opportunity to try  so got some macros and guess what we still have left $2.70 did you just just like Rob someone the person with all the speakers that's the person who messaged me and was like I looked at your profile you seem like a funny guy ended up giving me all of this
stuff this stuff bit of a problem he also gave me this thing I don't know if we can use this forget about that but he gave me this oh bum it's got an ax we can plug it into the computer with this he solved the problem without me even bringing up that it was a problem we could mount it in like a coely like under the desk here something yeah the keyboard what's this story some lady was just trying to get rid of stuff these were a thing when I was a teenager I don't know if it's going to work what
are you doing what's your story what's going on okay so I I have some before and after pictures this was just with a CPU overclock on Shadow of the Tomb Raider 1080p with everything on Ultra including R Trace Shadows did a little bit of GPU overclocking it's not much but anything higher I went we started thermal throttling which then means we were getting lower let's not bother with that 4 FPS when you're out of less than 100 yeah it's like 5% let's make sure I don't have to keep running out so let's
test this really I don't know if any of this is going to work literally everything that I have right now I have headphones I have a new key well this is nasty it's not new lights lights lights okay there you go okay but we need to see notepad oh  keyboard cool we have a functional keyboard headphones it has a mic I didn't even think about that play some  Noise We got working headphones nice crank them crank them brother that's what0 sounds like let's go thank you great thank you so much oh
we have $12 yes with tax we have 10 bucks essentially so we go buy something cute do they have a figure for 10 Buck wait we don't have any stationary to put our little sign out Nicole goes by penu pandering how much is it $4.99 we five more dollars so this we're going to leave our little notes on like guide to fully appreciating our system or whatever is this $299 yeah if we get this penguin okaying win yes we're going to gamble on a blind box that might have a blue penguin in it
okay which one this one has less space this one has ears and this one's taller and this one's taller we want a kind of shaky one cuz this one's a little lower or one that has like more space on the side so if you shake it like well that one has no space on the side no try this one oh this one is good I okay do we want this one I think okay we're going for it we'll take these items please you have a membership with this oh no thank you just for membership okay I will be a member thank you uh let's go get our
microphone I sent them an ETA already well the reason why we bought this is because we saw a little penguin in here that we really want okay three two one so you can't see through the bag you pull it open oh my God we got the dock our penguin the penguin let's go we're going to win oh my God for $3 and all you had to do was sacrifice your  yes great thank you problem all right take care and it it works uh yeah it work okay great thank you so much thank you oh do we have mouse pad address yeah
I have oh you got it yeah based on the current timing we are going to arrive back to the office with about 5 to 10 minutes to Cable manage and for Sammy to accent that front piece and like it's going to be tight and if Buddy didn't leave the mouse pad out we are not going to have a mouse pad which is going to cost us big time I'm a touch worried that we've put absolutely zero tuning into our system I think our best bet for that is to kind of spin it as a win so like as part of our system presentation
we talk about how like the system's not just for you know Extreme Gaming or whatever it's stable enough for anything you'd need to do explicitly not overclocked in any way Rock Solid stable like that kind of thing okay okay oh the guy replied oh so sorry I forgot to leave it outside wait we're not going to have the tomorrow okay oh sh we have $5 left I should have confirmed with him okay there's got to be a Canada Computers or a Memory Express somewhere around here as well memory Memory
Express Langley are we going to make it in time we can make it calling Memory Express Langley this location is open Monday through Friday yeah long story no time to tell it I need the cheapest mouse pad possible what is your cheapest mouse pad that you have in stock I'm talking like five bucks uh cheapest we do have is five bucks can you do five bucks including tax like can I give give you like a $5 bill um yeah should work yeah thank you so much I'll be there in 5 minutes
yes hi got the most look at that here's $5 you want your phone number can I get a receipt do you have something for like $7 uh next one up goes to like 15 15 okay think it's going to be this then doesn't really have a rubber backing here's what we're going to do Sammy the first thing we do when we get back we plug in a glue gun okay and we glue it down to the table so that they can't tell exactly how she glue this and then it'll be a rubber thing oh that'll work thank you have a great day thank you so
much take care not going to lie this is barely a mouse pad this is a piece of foam that you can put a mouse on but we'll take it how I'm imagining this is I could almost see either the computer on the right outside or underneath on the inside cuz if it's underneath on the inside we will need to drill another hole if it's on the outside we don't need to cuz we could theoretically just have everything run up along the back I feel like if it's on the desk it's going to make it not very even like to the
eyes I like the idea of the speakers and no Tower I think it's pretty cool I'm just wondering about the amp I think we still drill we can run these speaker wires directly off the back nice and neatly they can come up and in this way and it can be mounted there like something like that are you going to get a drill yeah right now all right I'm going to go try to get a wheel is there anything else in here no hey get out of here get out of here I'm not looking I'm not looking it's okay I'm coming away
look away look at your own as we we're driving up today I spotted two chairs in the wild I don't think I want the chairs  wheels that was easier than I expected I don't know if it's like   way solved that is sick squiggly is the way to go go uh I got two just in case it occurs to me I never thought to take a close look at this cable said it was a little flaky what buddy let's try this other  Bamboozled okay well that sure as heck isn't it well that is the flakiness of the cable revealed come on come on
what you know what I think it is this adapter doesn't support that do you have another adapter maybe okay do the cable management first okay I'm on it all right going to get everything starting to wire before we plug Mount this wiring it while it's mounted might be difficult but I don't know we don't have much time though we got to move real fast technically I think we have 12 minutes oh my god really I am not going to get this perfect I'm getting stuff off but there's things here that I believe have
lived here for a while can you give me a time check 150 yeah we officially only have 10 minutes LT okay magnetic Cable Management  balls not game banter how you guys doing for time uh never better I'm okay with adding some time if you want never better okay I may have to swap out a defective cable but that's my only concern and it comes with stick I don't know feel like off to the side is a little bit better I don't know if it's exactly centered okay but it's pretty I'm going with it then
okay that is wired in and then we can plug plug headphones in up here yeah I think we're okay just keep cable matching you've got 3 minutes and I'm going to keep cleaning this isn't movie Magic this isn't reality TV show magic we're actually just running out of time it doesn't look very nice but it either looks nice or it works does it feel okay it's a little Lumpy oh it is okay do more glue where's all my adapters be at here if you can go that way that's better I can go through
the front though if it needs to uh that is plugged in that's plugged in it works 25 seconds lint roller are you able to um make the mouse pad a little bit less horrible first penil down exactly how you leave it in 15 get seconds I don't have time to fix the glue uh I may not have a working computer in 15 seconds we got just slide against the wall five can everybody get like one more minute three two one the screen on this okay everyone pencil's down you guys need another
minute huh they can have another minute they don't need another minute nope we don't yeah it's done way to go everybody you did it I think we did great look at the setup yeah I think we did pretty good it was better than I expected I don't know if I've ever been this sweaty at the end of a scrapyard Wars I think we overestimated how much time we had to do the setup itself but I'm happy with  good we are here in the final stretch of scrapyard Wars and we have our three experts Nicholas plof our display and
keyboard expert Nicole Yun our Aesthetics expert and Riley I yeah that's regular guy wait can I be vibed Riley murdog VI you don't know which system is which right no why don't we start over here oh this is it this is it I thought this was something somebody left here by accident I'm really impressed that they have a chair this time around not bad not bad oh okay this is short person friendly I like that the keyboard yikes is that like orange dried up goop yum is this bribery absolutely how do we
split that three ways we could get Maybe a small Slurpee they got a 3080 in here oh wow who did they steal us from okay these headphones are also orange crusty  flavor yay there it is that's not bad odd stains on the chair I'll sit down anyway honestly I'm pretty impressed by the speakers one thing that I don't think Nicole touched on is uh looks like they got a Dack here high-fi stereo audio amplifier okay it's just an amp it's not a oh it's just an amp still though to drive these massive bookshelf
speakers I don't even know if you can call them bookshelf at this point headphones aren't amazing but they're not bad and they got a mic you know it's not the best monitor they've ever used but for the price point that they got to that's not bad they really hear the fans around pinning up that's why they've got the speakers and the headphones and I love the zooming mouse pad they have a mouse pad yeah wow that that orange crusty definitely is High Fidelity up close that's got some crust on it okay
well this is very smooth obviously I mean like we got a 3080 144 HZ screen one thing that's irritating to me as someone who whose desk is on the set where we film is a loud PC I cannot Abide a loud PC and this one is very loud it's all red all the time yes I would have liked something a little something a little more they're also not showing it off at all they just shoved it in a corner if you're putting this forward to be judged why are you hiding in a corner this is a
big desk you could you could easily put that up here so I mean mineus some points for shame uh on their part overall Vibes I mean for $800 for this complete setup that's not bad at all don't give your scores yet yeah it's time to go look at the other system immediately wow this looks way better to me it's so comfortable you've got some personal affects look at that look at that little penguin it's so happy to see me they're showing off their SST custom it's nice and clean there's no sign of
any orange crusty anywhere you know they're even more personal a effect oh that's so cute there's candy see this is a station I would be happy to sit at and use let's see how it feels so right off the bat the monitor is much less impressive but it's cute I don't understand what's going on with this mouse pad there has to be some kind of crusty there's okay one second that's something blue crusty blue crusty The elusive blue Vari interesting I guess that does provide grip Mouse is very fancy and then
there's a nice blue microphone ooh with a cute little bow very nice quiet knock to a fans one LT Edition modern platform runs runs Windows 11 oh I didn't even think about that one keyboard is nicer it's not mechanical but it it it feels it feels better and newer feels pretty good it's definitely I'm guessing 60 HZ also 1080p K that's fine they're on a budget edifier speakers they're much smaller than the huge bookshelf towers that were over there I don't think the sub's doing very
much it's doing something these aren't bad I think they're pretty similar they also mentioned zero overclocking for gaming every day so it's going to be nice and stable allegedly bribes are really getting you yeah oh I'm such a sucker for candy the frame rate is a cable issue but this monitor's capable of higher refresh allegedly so the refresh rate issue was really like uh we're speeding to the end of the Finish Line only to trip kind of oh I'm so torn I hate that this is stuck at 60 I think
it's the better computer but I think ultimately a way worse monitor we got a DP 1.4 8K thing yo going into DVI dongle to that's not their fault that's not their fault what do you mean it's not their fault that's something they had to think about when they were they should have thought about it no free lunches here so I had some immediate thoughts upon coming over here the vibe is immediately more welcoming just because of the high contrast between the dark peripherals and the PCS and stuff and
the lighter desk over there we got a darker desk and dark peripherals it just kind of looks like I think the word is Dink is is there no headset there was no headset on this one if anything I would expect that one to not have headphones instead of this one this one looks like you've taken the uh how it appears to other people into account I don't know what who I present when I say that uh 60 FPS is like just fine for me in most things o oh oh oh this yeah yeah I I I can tell that it's 60 nice Boomer scored
see and I think I'm already getting used to the 60 and this is the thing have you ever heard the term comparison is the thief of Joy that's what this is all about and they scored on us God damn it it's not screaming oh yeah that's I can't even hear it at all it's not making any sound who's this guy what's his name it's friend it's funny you know I wouldn't guess that something like that would work on me but it does I like that it's I like that he's there I don't like the
ribbon though did they do this to cover oh okay you're disassembling the well I didn't I didn't know I would be disass I mean that's shoddy workmanship wait that's the same that's a blue glue that's a blue crusty the rabbit hole goes deeper what's up guys hey if you want to see the whole uncut uncensored version of us judging these systems head on over to float plane what happens on float plane stays there all right see you later before we get to the judges score I want to announce what settings
the benchmarks will be run at for the teams okay for Red Dead Redemption medium okay for cyberpunk medium no Ray tracing oh however yeah I mean if you had read The Benchmark document you would know that you get to pick a benchmark and every single setting at which it runs at we're going to pick shadow of the Tomb Raider what it's way better I I tested both I promise you it's better and L Sammy have you picked your benchmark do you even know what the choices are no you can pick from the list we'll take
f123 low okay the judges have conferred and it's time for their scores in the category of Aesthetics this one over here is nice lots of room but it looks a little old 17 out of 25 this setup gives me sketchy and hidden in a basement where things that shouldn't happen are happening oh so I give this a 15 what kind of den is it called goon cave yeah a goon cave I largely agree with Nicole on this one it doesn't seem right I'm giving it a 10 the next category is sound this system had bigger speakers
I'm not saying they're better but they're bigger and it had an amp I'm giving this one also headphones a Tim wild it had both headphones and speakers the headphones were so crusty that I didn't want to put them on I forgot to clean those no oh I gave four each for having both they both work so a total of eight I also appreciate that this one had speakers and headphones but as Nicole said they're kind of crusty I'm giving this one an eight next category stratem or also known as creativity
total creativity I think it's not bad I'm going to give it an 18 out of 25 I actually think that they were incredibly creative with what they've done here they tried so hard to hide every sketchy part of system even with the tempered glass panel that was pushed up against the desk it very creative it's full of problem solving i' give this actually a full 25 what let's go right there buddy very good despite the aesthetic being concerning the strategy here is clear they wanted High
frame rate and they achieved it I think so I'm giving it a 23 you only get frame rates that are so high with that CPU uh it's pretty good actually well and the monitor is capable of it burn sh it actually is capable we wouldn't know the last category is the effectiveness of the system how much would you like to use this setup I'm very torn I don't like most of the peripherals I do love the monitor I'm going to give it a 30 as much as it's creepy and kind of sketchy kind of crusty gross it's very usable it
performs well I give this a 30 if I'm thinking about this as something I'm going to be coming and sitting repeatedly at uh it's not very inviting but you know it's not horrible I'm giving it uh 20 out of 40 I will tabulate these scores but it is time to move on to system number two it's much prettier and more inviting so I'm going to give it a 25 it gets full points I really like the whole thing super comfy brought me joy the only thing was the mouse pad that kind of got me I'd give
this a 23 I'm giving it a 20 I like the contrast the light desk dark peripherals it's inviting but there's also some weird stuff going on there not having a pair of headphones and being stuck with desktop mic and speakers I'm giving it more like a seven if the other was a full 10 I'd actually give this a six because while they weren't as gross they didn't really blow me out of the water I like headphones a bit more than speakers so I'm going to give this one a seven next category is stratem they tried real
hard I think overall they tried real hard hey hey I do love candy I love candy in terms of creativity I genuinely like it with without the bribe I'd still give it a 23 I was very impressed but the fact that both the mous pad and the monitor were kind of Jank I'd give this a 23 I forgot what I gave this one but I wanted to give them the same score because they went for different things but they both kind of achieved what they were going for 23 23 and me and the last category is Effectiveness I'm incredibly
torn I really prefer that monitor but the peripherals on this one in terms of mouse and keyboard and just overall smoothness of using the computer was a lot better so I'm going to give it a 35 just the fact that sitting at the station it doesn't make me not want to touch anything and to shy away it brings me comfort and joy this gets a 35 I definitely wanted to use this one a lot more and despite the lower frame rate the overpowered Hardware made things smooth so this is a 30 for me you guys
better hope you win some benchmarks we're going to that concludes the judging thank you expert judges you may now leave please please leave please leave I'm going to tabulate the score and while I do that the contestants are going to take a look at each other's systems your chair is actually this is horrendous I think there might be more shoo on your setup I think they just saw the bright desk compared to darker peripherals and thought it was nicer I think yours is actually more goon cavey
than ours is like this armrest on this chair is gross it that's a sound ours doesn't move great either yeah you pulled your wheel off of a dumpster chair you know I didn't have time to  yeah I wish I had tuned that first what is that is that a 3060 or 3070 3070 that's the 3070 from Jawa yeah so that was my original idea as well uh this is a ryzen 5 4500 nice we've got 16 gigs of 3200 Ram we did manage to enable XMP it like worked immediately 3600 never mind so 3600 is a big Advantage for CPU
performance for us here you had no time to overclock though right I had no time to overclock cuz we cranked a bunch more performance out of the 17700 yeah but your Zen one how many cores is this one again is it six but they're fast they're much faster and we have faster Ram let's see your goon cave setup yeah hell yeah welcome to the dungeon oh this front fan is barely spinning I wonder if your GPU is just like starving it's probably starving this case has literally no front intake yes we were trying to get
more fans and stuff it kind of ran out of time this was a very short scrap R Wars we also we had lots of fans and lots of cases yeah we have headphones maybe if you've gotten that CR we m yeah nice Mouse it's so brok you're supposed to have light mice they're supposed to be light it jumped out of my hands it fell down behind oh from Z Lang wolf brand hey it's actually all right if you don't Smash It Anyways there's aess there's a good there's a recess portion at the back of the desk that we thought about
mounting the computer on instead of having it in a case oh yeah but that was another like we don't have enough time for this situation I can't believe this monitor how much you get $75 off Jaa okay that's a good deal it was actually sick figuring out the balance was really tough um what' you pay for that GPU 500 500 C yeah I still like our deal better I'm sorry the original I had decided 3070 immediately on yeah we saw that deal and we were like that is probably we should buy the 3070 spend the rest on
everything else and then it was like but the like turbo gas gas gas option is buy a $500 380 so we just like did it for fun then now we'll see what happens your XMP is not working uh it should it was not working during when the judges were there what Elijah it was I literally had it on and I unplugged and moved it here when Mom and Dad start fighting that's fine we'll just re we'll use one of our reruns you can set XMP now cuz you're like allowed to overclock oh are we all right see you later well we're
just going to rely on software we're going to download ryzen Master software and we're going to download MSI After Burner and we're basically just going to turn the power knobs all the way to the end and hope for the best so we are 65 higher that was the only stable I could get and then we do have XMP I mean there's not much for us to do in the 10 minutes overclocking time cuz we're already pretty dial in we'll do c a bench first all right we're just hitting start on single core start on single
core hey we're done 72 points boys that's uh lower than your lab score so we're going to go with your lab score that's lower than our lab score that's 74 well okay hey there we go 60 all right multicore are we giving it a moment to like chill or we just nice try we're running oh okay going what's your score 564 545 545 that's close though yeah I don't know if I would dance that much we knew you going to win CPU benchmarks not uh GPU this is where Things Fall Apart a little bit all right 3 2 1 go what was
your score "12,653 what was yours 10135 sorry" 10135 well I think we know who won that one what do we do next it is now the blender render okay am I missing something here is this going to take 46 minutes no it should be like 90 seconds okay yeah it say time remaining 41 minutes let's just skip this one and do the lap Square yeah sure fine what are  99.96% all right next one is cyber Punk on medium wait so did we win this one you did win that one yes so medium no bra tracing that sucks so much I was
specifically confident in cyberpunk and the fact that we're running it so low makes me not very confident to be honest okay what was your average their score is 98.53 105.3 to team Balan okay next one F1 everything low it's close but we needed to win that so I think that's kind of it oh did it crash I don't know did they crash good thing we chose this game tone down the GPU a tiny bit oh should we T them the CPU that was what was unstable  slightly got to Huff it h that copium detail your set
who Okay 194 194 okay let's come have a looky boo all right let's see average  but but that's not that bad they were supposed to spank you on this one this is their chosen Benchmark but we still win a win is a win yeah win's a win win is a win well our chosen Benchmark is shadow of the Tomb Raider move on Luke W is a w bit I had to reboot I hope our GPU overclock was on nope it wasn't wait what yeah Luke's going toing kill me is that legit oh my God Elijah forgot to initialize the GPU clock after we
restarted so that was completely not overclocked well turn it on now quick for the last one yeah we did you can still win this yeah sure so on Graphics everything the preset is highest oh yeah R TR Shadow to ultra okay is this the last Benchmark this is the last Benchmark it all comes down to this we'd have to beat them by 20% or more on this  go that's a butt nice so many butts it's what the setup was made for you even get that you're too down come on man it's fine what is it
what is it you guys want I'm sure yeah I don't know why it was so bad guess what ours was 78 90 90 wow that's so weird do you want to know what's you you want to know you know you want to know what's crazy I can't hear what you're saying over the sound of your fans that's fair oh damn you want to know the worst part Glenn I have a picture here of me getting 94 okay I guess I have 9 don't they get to keep the better of their two tests though yeah that's true so if they got a better score when Labs
tested it theoretically Labs didn't test this one this is a chosen one they tested it and got a better one so you could be really kind and give them that David every time I do that I lose the game over it you know that how much confidence you have in your system you know what I'll do it again they can have it yeah okay what what was your highest score Elijah he had 94 94 95 95 on our average FPS it's insane close when it comes to these Benchmark drag races out of a possible 900 score it's only 13 points of
difference and team lonus is ahead by those 13 points with 764 by 751 but there's two different modifiers there's the judging differential which they so the average score uh for Luke's team was 71.3 okay and the average score for Linus's team was 85.6 so it's a 14.3 boost to their score team Bal we we just fall over and when it came down to the labs differential which was a 15% boost to the winner we have five categories so someone needs to win three categories in order to take that win you guys will
crush us on sound but your drive might hurt you if they actually are you going let talk first category is the out of the box experience which is a little bit of a subjective experience the winner of that one was Luke so one Luke zero L you can take it up with Labs okay I like Labs now second test was thermals and it was close L actually had better CPU thermals but your GPU thermals were very problematic you a hot spot of 104 on the GPU have a broken fan he didn't broken fan and so lonus takes that category
one1 baby repasting for the win then we tested memory speeds and it was really really close even though the specs are different but lonus did out Edge lonus no EDG lius lius edged Luke just a little bit he does that one but then it was storage and even if I only included Linus's SSD score he still would have lost to Luke 22 we did spend a notable amount of extra money on our SS but unfortunately for Luke's team the last category was sound go got to AAL and so the winner of scrapyard Wars 2024 is team
R CL good job good I'm ready for him to start crying yeah we have to gather the tears so I can season my food and the tears you have as tattoos don't count I asked for those you should have told oh yeah probably better you didn't yeah probably and it's probably better you guys didn't miss any of this year's scrapyard Wars I hope you guys enjoyed this we'll see you again next time oh yeah shout out Jawa for sponsoring this video and we all got good deals on Jawa yeah if you guys like these systems
they're going to be available for giveaway on Jawa so get over to ja. that's super cool and they're actually really legit and one is really loud leave a comment under the video letting us know which system you'd rather have  yours I mean it's pretty nice ah if you didn't get that system that I wanted we would have crushed that
