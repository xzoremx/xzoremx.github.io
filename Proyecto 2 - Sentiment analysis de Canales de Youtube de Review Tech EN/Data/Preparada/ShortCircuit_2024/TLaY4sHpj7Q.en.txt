when Haven reached out to sponsor this video they had my curiosity but when they told me it was to check out their new premium midtower case the hs420 they had my attention oh my God cuz this thing is sick oh my God it's so heavy before we take a look at the case let's see what comes in the Box we've got our hs420 user guide we've got what looks to be an accessory box says start here so I probably should have started there starting there now accessory kit yes very good what else we got we got some
Drive sleds actually I'm not sure what this is we've got a bunch of zip ties and screws velcro strap we have some little these cable holders little cable Combs very nice and then oh wow they gave us gloves I've unboxed a lot of cases uh both at work and at home and I have never once seen a pair of gloves included these guys they really want you to be safe while you're building I'm not going to say they're like the nicest gloves I've ever put on on but uh you know I'm sure they do whatever they're
supposed to do we've got this cool little thank you card from The Haven team they're a new company that are made up of members from other case manufacturers that you've probably heard of like fractal NZXT Cooler Master and you know it's their first product we're not sure how it's going to go but it looks frankly pretty good they've got this beautiful single pane curved glass piece right here so that you're not going to get anything in the way of looking looking at your beautiful build as you
put it into your case they call it their uni sheet heat form panoramic glass and it's supposed to be flatter and got a tighter curve radius on here I don't know how necessary it was but it's cool now you might be thinking to yourself that's not a mesh front I want a mesh front panel for airf flow well you've got a bunch of that down here this is all opened up for their nice bottom intake cuz as you can see we've got three big 140 mm fan mounts down here normally flat but we've got the vgpu kit
version which is a bit more expensive we'll talk about price later but that's angled up to better kind of push the air up so that you can get it into your vertically mounted GPU there is a nice oh oh that's actually really easy to take out there's a really nice filter here um but I don't understand why they can't add another small grate just on the bottom I would kind of like that personally so that it doesn't even get into here but you know what I think it's going to do just fine in terms of air
flow at least because the top is also very ventilated it's also got a ton of ventilation on the back side panel as well as another big hole along the bottom in the front as for the top bio it's got a really satisfying power button click as well as two USB type A ports one type c port and an audio jack and the best part is you see this strap that's not for carrying it it's way too heavy for that it's to just lift the whole top off like this so it's super easy to work in and then we can still
take take both side panels off now it ships with two screws installed onto either panel but if we take those off it should be held in place magnetically oh is there one more screw and once you got all the screws out it's actually held in place pretty nicely with some magnets so if you do want easy access but still you know kind of held together just don't put those screws back in when you're reassembling it it should be okay okay yeah it just lifts up that was easy one thing I actually didn't notice until
just now is it's got this really nice Haven logo on the back here it's beautiful is there a front logo wow actually there's like no front logo grip here when removing panel okay so they give you some little instructions for that warning watch your hands and fingers that's what the gloves are for Handle With Care okay so this one will come off the back no problem Oh I used where the circles are and it was no problem so look we're just  pull how oh okay I'll admit I'm terrified of breaking this um there's
something about curved glass that just makes me think it's even more fragile than your standard panel but like now that I've got pretty much everything off this is going to be so incredibly easy to build in like probably one of the easiest cases I've ever built in my entire life and it looks like if you don't want even more obstructions you can take it off you can take this uh what looks to be a rad mounting or fan mounting rack uh one minor complaint I have oh no I don't even have that
complaint because it's just all the sides are off I was going to be like there's no screen on the fan but like there is it's just not on right now and then if you want to get even more stuff out of the way you just take out these two screws which are held in by these nice little rubber mounts which is good because this is going to vibrate cuz it's probably for your radiator or fans then you pull it forward and just lift it out just like that even easier now I can really get my whole hand into this
thing or this way or this way or this way or this way like you're just never going to have a problem there's also more of them if you look at this rear fan Mount here these are all set up with  rubber this thing is also able to fit 1140 mm fans which is a lot of air flow and if that's not enough air flow for you and you want some water cooling in here it can do three 420 mm RADS that's one here one here if you're not using the vertical Mount cuz this is normally flat this is an extra that we've got and
then one on what I'm guessing is the side back here after I get rid of this uh vgpu kit one moment please we've got a bunch of handily labeled storage Bays back here but if you take a look on their website can confirm that this is supposed to be where the third mounting position for a 420 mm rad goes like I know this is sponsored but I got to appreciate that these are all marked like Storage storage and there's more labels that's not the only one recommended for top fan cables they've
got little recommendations for how to route your cables on the back here recommended for 4x4 pin cables for your EPS connectors for your CPU recommended for the 24 pin like it's just got everything you could like want if you've never built a computer before and you don't know where to Route all these cables they call it their simply cable routing system and it should offer you a pretty you know discreet and tidy cable management system um I like it it's got velcro straps basically everywhere you
could want it's got a bunch of huge cable channels that are all clearly labeled like I said uh then you've also got these like I have never seen rubber grommets done like this before and it also really explains um that box of cable Combs that I found earlier you put them on here and then you run your cables through here and then you run the Combs down through here so you can kind of really separate everything and keep it nice and clean and tidy the problem with those big open grommets that I
genuinely love because I think it's better than having an empty hole is uh they get kind of bunched up and you can't really control the cables within the grommets whereas this it should be easy enough to just like put a cable there put a cable comb put another cable up there put another cable comb just to make sure nothing ever gets moved around so your cables are always looking pristine they're right where you want them to be who can hate that this thing also has a bunch of fan hubs if you
haven't noticed I mean by a bunch I mean two but like we've got one here which has 1 2 3 4 5 five six fans that's pretty good and then there was yeah right down here then we've got another one down here for even more fans 1 2 3 4 5 six so even though this thing only holds 11 fans they've got 12 headers that's extra fans just throw them in there this thing is super customizable I love it we're going to take the storage out so that you can fit whatever you want maybe a 420 mm
Rad or even a vase amount I really like this case I am so sold on this even just this like Drive sled caddy thing this is this is great I've never needed to move eight drives at once before but if I had to now I can that thing we had earlier is a vase amount turns out and it can go kind of like this oh kind of like this so that you can just mount a screen back here that's sick I can do whatever I want all right now that we've got this sucker taken apart it's time to put a computer in it one moment please
we're done well mostly the cable management while the system in the case is actually great managing this many fans and this much stuff is just going to take you quite a while I'm sure it looks beautiful when it's actually properly cable managed but if you don't want a cable manage because you're lazy or like me you just don't have the time for it this was pretty easy to stuff everything in and just shut the case and instead of using the magnets I screwed it down and look it's closed it's
running we're good to go another another thing the rubber grommets while I do love the look of it and I love the idea of like actually organizing and managing everything perfectly without planning you're going to end up with a lot of instances where you're like I think I want it in the second slot and down here and then you're going to do your cable runs and realize oh no it doesn't work there I've got to move it over a slot and then that requires instead of just kind of with
the big open gromets it's really easy to just move stuff around don't get me wrong it looks amazing but that takes some time the sound dampening screws for the case fans it was a little Annoying if you're using 140 fans to actually get the plates off and then screw everything in without issue for instance um because it's a plastic screw going into rub rubber grommet I broke one of them I just screwed it down a little too much I thought I had some more room and no I was cracking the plastic it was already
seated uh so don't be like me all the rest of them went in fine no more broke but definitely broke the first one the vertical mount looks great it really does but without some proper planning you might run into issues where you've got to take it out and adjust something for example I didn't do the bottom fan and you've got to actually take this bracket off if you want to put a 140 in and you can't reach that unless you're going through the vertical GPU Mount that being said if you don't get the
vertical GPU Mount it's going to be a pretty reasonable price at $200 it's also going to come with probably one of the most stylish uh GPU anti- sag brackets I've ever seen it actually looks pretty good and I kind of wanted to do that version today but we got the vertical one which retails for $270 it's on the pricey side I'm not going to deny that but the fact that it comes with a pcie Gen 5 Riser it comes with the mounting hardware for the vertical Mount it's got this really cool
curved glass the power supply is in its own like second chamber so there's no air being shared between the power Supply intake and like the GPU is just getting everything from in here on the bottom feeding up to here into the back like it's it's good but out of time and I need help reys Rees plof was too lazy to uh do his own Cable Management so they sent me in I'm reys nice to meet you um let me show you the back here these channels here are very handy they just kind of fit in the
channels and it was very nice these um passrs are quite nice they normally with like The Grommet style you only have one entry one exit so all the core is kind of pile up at the bottom in one corner but with these as you can see you can kind of spread them out make them all nice and I think just look so much better compared to like other full-size cases that I've built in the past I feel like this it just it's so much better for cable organization if I was to give this case of rating I'd probably give it
like a N9 out of 10 it's pretty good um I'm not usually a full-size case person I prefer ITX smaller cases but if I was going to go full size this would definitely be a contender all right that's it that's it for my thoughts uh back that lazy blof thanks again Haven for sponsoring this video what do you guys think would you buy it the hs420 you want to take the time to Cable manage and make it look super pretty with this sick curved glass let us know in the comments
