as I'm sure you guys know I absolutely love Dell's XPS 15 and even though this thing is living on a tiny bit more it has been replaced and its replacement is a bit complicated let's have a look at  it's decisions all right we've got a black box here there it is let's go beneath for a second Dell is still including a dongle with their laptops right here I do like to see that cuz everyone else that's like oh we took away your IO but at least we gave you a dongle they all stopped giving you
dongles but Dell fortunately has kept  it this is all paper so I do enjoy seeing that plug it in hit the power button there you go for charging we have 130 watt brick and that's being delivered over USB type c ooh oh I I just picked it up to take off this it looks nice but man this thing is heavy let's get at the scale for comparison I have the XPS 15 here that is 4.37 lb not light but somewhat acceptable I also have the zephrus g16 4.2 pretty good pretty good and now the new XPS 16 5
PB yeah this thing you pick it up and it is heavy now why is this so heavy because glass I really really liked on the old xps15 how a lot of it was made out of carbon fiber carbon fiber is a great material for a laptop because it is light another really good material for laptops also is magnesium you see lots of laptops using that these days do you know what's not Light Glass and lots of it here we have glass all along here glass all up here extra thick Gorilla Glass up here and that all means that
this thing right here is going to be hurting your back if you have it in your backpack for a while In fairness I should be comparing this to the XPS 17  comparable maybe 2 mm thicker than the old XPS but also why compared to the old XPS 17 when we have new Asus g16 which is way more comparable it's maybe exactly the same thickness now seeing that they're the same thickness and the g16 has things like type a full sizee SD card reader and HDMI what can we find on the XPS well it's pretty similar to the old
one in that it kind of sucks so on the left we have two Thunderbolt fours and on the right we have just USB type-c headphone microphone combo Jack and a Micro SD card reader which I hate Dell says that this right here is acceptable because it is as fast as a Micro SD card reader can be in a laptop but at the same time when I'm doing photography stuff my camera does not have a micro SD card it has a fullsize SD card and it was so nice to be able just go over and do a bunch of photos and then come back
in Chuck it right in here have it immediately go into Lightroom wonderful stuff I do feel like I was a lot more optimistic four years ago when the old xps15 came out that we would just all be switching to USB type-c but now for whatever reason in 2024 we feel almost further away from that than ever it is pretty though it is really pretty I have to give them that it's almost as pretty as our sponsor all right Belle what does dbrand have for me this is D Brand's new hydro dip skin it comes in five different
colorways why why didn't we just use this one this looks awesome so is this a skin or is it actually hydr dep so it is just a skin I mean they just make expensive stickers and they're actually not making it for laptops what but they do have it for phones oh fancy so we've got all of the colors right here we've got solar flare cotton candy bubble gum toxic waste and Gold Rush it's available for smartphones right now but sadly not for laptops unless you are Bros with dbrand but if
you want it for laptops or gaming consoles or handhelds you should go and just bu bug dbrand on Twitter get get "them mad maybe they'll give you $10,000" yeah maybe they'll give you "$10,000 there's almost no way that I'm" going to be able to show you what I am seeing but the problem that I have is that there's just it looks like dirtiness so you have the digitizer for the touchscreen that has to be overlaid over the pixels that display your stuff and the problem is is that a lot of LCDs
have different subpixel layouts than the oleds so you can have that digitizer somewhat blocking the sub pixels of your OLED screen and it creates kind of like a dirtiness now when I'm back here where I'll mostly be using the laptop it's fine but if I get into about right here I am able to see that digitizer over top of the OLED sub pixels so the whole thing just looks kind of dirty future Alex here we are having some trouble with the display but an update has solved that and it is now absolutely
fantastic digit ER aside now one thing that's a little bit strange is we have Dell Premiere color and we also have my Dell they both choose different modes and stuff and they will compete against each other and make things bad so just choose one of them but once you've done that it is absolutely fantastic in SDR we measured 390 nits Peak brightness for the whole window which is excellent and even better we had an average Delta e of 1.6 which means that you could very easily use this for professional photos
work at the same time in HDR it goes up to 630 nits Peak brightness on the whole panel 100% window size that is freaking fantastic and also it has really good color accuracy as well with an average luminance error of 17.4 and an average the other one of 6.9 I honestly don't understand HDR metrics Labs results aside this is also just a fantastic panel it is 3840 by 2490 HZ so even though it is a little bit dirty from that digitizer it looks really freaking good and I do really appreciate that it's an
OLED with a touchscreen we don't get a whole lot of that also for power saving it will go down to 48 HZ but we do not have g-sync on this so let's go to one of the other controversial bits of this  the keyboard's Fantastic it is a little bit strange with the zero lattice layout that they have here but the way that it's dished makes it pretty easy to find your keys I haven't had too many problems with the layout like I've seen people complain about the backspace being over here I haven't had any issues
with that and overall I think it is really good like I'm going to give this a solid a and I'm going to downgrade it to an A minus or maybe a B+ because of up here so so we very sadly do not get actual function rows and instead have to deal with this Bad Touch bar knockoff we first saw this on the Dell XPS 13 plus and I'm very sad that it's made its way over here in particular the most egregious thing here is the Escape key there's so many times where you're just doing a thing and you go Boop and with
no physical button here it's much easier to just miss it you'll hit there hit there hit there or something like that it's just nowhere near as accurate or generally good as a physical button the rest are okayish I just want buttons guys is it really that hard below that though is the touchpad and this is controversial but at the same time I don't think it should be cuz it is really really good we can see that it starts right around there is and ends around there and you might suspect
that you'll have problems finding it but it's so big that I have never had that problem it's Force touch so it has little pasos below it that measure the force and give you a little when you click it in and it works really nice the tracking is super accurate I've had no problems with the Palm rejection and overall I just think it's a really good touchpad but back to the other glass covered bin on the Dell XPS 13 plus where we very first saw this capacitive layer up here I gave it a little bit of
a pass because that was the fastest 13-in notebook Dell says that they use these capacitive touch buttons so they can have more room for cooling and just more power and on the XPS 13 plus they did that it is the fastest 13-in notebook but this right here is it the fastest 16in well let's  that's not Escape there we go so for performance we get an Intel Core Ultra 7 155h 32 GB of RAM running at 7467 megat transfers per second a 1 TB nvme SSD Intel WiFi 7 love to see that got an npu
for AI boosting crap and also an RTX 470 now in this 40 70 version right here we have a vapor chamber for cooling and on the 4060 and lower you get some heat pipes now going back to our whole capacitive buttons give us the most power we don't get that here so the RTX 470 in this sadly only gets 60 wats of power dedicated to it and the total system power is 80 comparing that to this laptop which has has inconvenient things like a function row has 85 Watts dedicated just to the GPU and this also
comes with a 4080 version which can go up to 955 Watts on the GPU so the XPS 16 is not the fastest 16-in laptop by a lot now we did compare these two laptops and it might seem a little bit unfair to have the 4070 version of the xps1 16 and the 4080 version of the g16 but we did that because they are price comparable and also like they both have OLED panels so I think it is pretty fair and uh yeah turns out a 4080 is way freaking faster than a 4070 absolute shocker looking at
in cyberpunk 106 FPS on the Asus 81 on the Dell f123 Asus 157 XPS 118 total Warhammer 9360 so it's not looking too good good oh I'm so sorry D all right even though this is not the most performant gaming laptop in existence because it's not a gaming laptop shocker I know it should still be really good here's our good friend Paul okay we need to damn it no Escape key we going to want to turn it down to like 2560 x600 cuz it can't quite do 4K but looking at this here we're getting a pretty solid ah 60 FPS
and I've seen it go up to 90 or so in valheim so that is really quite good given the settings that we have but that is at that 1600p and not at the 4K that you really really want the 4070 just cannot do that high of a resolution that said though panel extremely responsive you can just whip around right here so I do think that you can very easily be gaming on this PC and have quite a good time just as long as you don't expect to be doing full 4K gaming in modern games and just
as long as you don't want to be able to easily get Escape now Dell says the speakers on this are the best they've ever made four speakers 10 watts and apparently it's really good future Alex again uh so we tested the speakers on this guy and it turns out they aren't very good that's because they're blown from the factory uh quality control probably still getting worked out very early in production here but fortunately dbrand sent us one and it is just fine so let's let's have a little crab Reef
here all right that sounds a lot cleaner than before that's pretty good that's pretty darn good that's really loud I'm talking very loud right now but one thing that I've noticed that's interesting is that the sound profile kind of changes depending on the volume you get a lot more bass like around here and then I think that dynamic range compression is kind of removing it way up here like it's way  volume stop stop but can it compare to the MacBook 14 all right Dell XPS 16 MacBook Pro oh h
I think the MacBook wins the Dell definitely got a little bit louder but it was kind of chy when it was at full volume whereas the MacBook sounds a lot more just balanced in general all right now one area that Dell has said that they've vastly improved this laptop is the webcam and it looks like they are very correct there looking at right here we're at 1080p moving around it's exposing for my face really oh it's not there uh direct light maybe not but the second that we go right there it has
figured it out moving around it's figuring all of this out really well to expose for my face and as long as you're not like pointing it at the sun it seems like you're going to have a pretty good time overall so good job there Dell you finally made a webcam that's good 8 T5 screws later and we are in and we can see this Vapor chamber that we have right here which does a decent job it does an okay job not the best job not the worst job why did they need to do the function row like we only have
actual cooling fins here and here which like there's almost some space over here where they could have some cooling lots of laptops do but mostly just like why the do I have to have that stupid capacitive touch button if there's not going to be heat sink in there like it's clearly not for cooling if all of this is not cooling stuff I just do not understand it like this would be so much of a better laptop if they're able to get like another 25 watts out of the GPU but they just they just haven't also
very disappointing is that Dell took a whole bunch of time to create a compression attached memory module so that allows you to have a super thin super fast replaceable memory on your laptop so you're going have something that's nice and slim but at the same time still upgradeable not here Ram soldered down very sad and it looks like our Wi-Fi card is as well now one area that they have vastly improved with the Dell X ps16 though is in battery life this new generation of Intel chips has
proven that they are fantastically efficient compared to the old ones and when you pair that with a 99.5 wat hour battery and the fact that OLED technology on laptops has progressed to where it's not too much of a a battery hit this thing is great we were able to get 12 hours out of it in our endurance test fan freaking fastic now let's do our double-sided SSD test Chuck it in here you might want to get a different thermal pad for right here this seems a tiny bit thick but that is a really easy
replacement and there's nothing that I can see below yeah there's nothing below it so just replace this thermal pad with one that's slightly thinner and you are all good for a double-sided SSD in here so the Dell XPS 16 I do feel like I've been a little bit hard on it maybe a little bit too hard on it but there is a good reason the price this thing starts at "$1,900 and that does not get you a" dedicated GPU that also gets you a 1200p display without touch so just to kind of
get in the door you need to do an extra $400 for this OLED panel which is makes it like an acceptable panel for a laptop in this price range and then what's this one  "$3,400 " ouch it's a sort of thing where I can accept the compromises of this weird capacitive thing and the glass down here if it was obscenely fast if this thing just walked over other laptops maybe we could accept it but this thing makes a MacBook Pro seem reasonably priced this thing right here you can buy a razor
blade that is similarly spec for less money I I don't know Dell needs to go and just figure some stuff out because with the iio and the performance of this thing it's very very hard to recommend I'm I'm sorry guys so huge thanks for watching guys hit like get subscribed and just have a great all day see you later
