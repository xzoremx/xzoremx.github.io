holy crap it's the world's fastest processor again you know if you look at the fine print it says they're reaching The Cutting Edge of CPU frequency to release the fastest processor ever but if you start reading between the lines and specifically down to the footnotes you might notice that by fastest CPU the only thing they mean is the frequency sure it is fast we are talking a 14900 K with a whopping 6.2 GHz Max tur frequency apparently uh it that is the fastest that's the fastest they' ever
done I mean wow packaging wise they haven't changed anything in a while I mean this is in theory the last of a generation the next Intel Desktop CPUs are very likely going to be not monolithic anymore and by that I mean one single die they're going to be switching to a design somewhat similar to AMD with chiplets but this is the new fastest processor the Intel Core I9 14900 K uh the video is done I'm done unboxing it you can see it right here that is all you need to know Jokes Aside it is a
very similar CPU you're talking the same core counts you're talking the same architecture the only thing that's really changed is the max turbo frequency and the power limits uh you're looking at 6.2 GHz like I mentioned earlier which is up from 6 GHz on the 14900 K was the 13900 K also 6 gz if I remember correctly I'm getting a knot of approval so yes uh and the power limit 320 Watt on the pl1 and pl2 and 150 wat base power which is insane I mean I think about my 13900 k at home if I turn
MCE on with like no limits with a 360 mil rat and an EK water block just cooling it I'm I'm stuck at like 340 350 Watts with it sitting at 90° I don't see how this is going to be that much better I'm sure it's going to draw a ridiculous amount of power I mean it has to they want you without even turning MCE on to be hitting 320 Watts on this thing I can't imagine this is going to perform that much better I'm getting some weird looks but seriously there's not that much more to say I mean other than just
trying it out I suspect what's going to happen is we plug this in and we look at the lab's results and this is going to perform marginally better maybe a couple percent at drastically worse power which is kind of how it usually is this is a scary precedent is all I'm saying I mean you look at AMD you get like a 7 800 x 3D that's a power efficient chip really good for gaming if you're just gaming I don't know about this but hey only a little bit prior judgment let's just see
how it actually performs with this uh cooler on here what is this the 360 mil  360 it's like the easiest short circuit ever guess what nothing changed our test bench is running we're in windows I can't wait to see how obnoxiously power hungry this is but not before I tell you about today's sponsor game Power reminiscence of some of the most popular PC cases on the market the war cry is a tried and tested Fusion of style and substance with six argb fans included this midtower case supports htx
motherboards fullsize graphics cards and 360 mil radiators and its dual-sided tempered glass lets you enjoy the beauty of your build whether you're In the Heat of the game or need some additional illumination for that essay you're typing out so check it out at the link down alone you can even save on your purchase do we have cinch let's run cin bench I don't see C cin bench I mean I can see it turboing I see 5.9 GHz I don't see 6.2 cuz that's in theory that's just in the most optimal of
circumstances One Core will do that that's the idea likely so here let's do  5.9 oh I see 6.2 holy right there look at that oh it went away it was there for like a second see Max 6.2 hell yeah Intel marketing confirmed they can do it boys and girls I mean it was there for like a second let's try again oh look at that 6.2 holy sh that was for it it recorded 6.2 on 1 second increment that's it wow I'm really feel like I'm getting what I paid for now I'm sure the average clock
speeds are are probably similar amount higher but how much power are we drawing okay this is only a single core test and we're we're looking at 80 Watts Let's do multicore let's see the big scary number it's probably going to be big and scary I'm scared and I haven't even done it yet the aiio is like ripping now yeah it um it it hits 320 Watts the Turbo Power wasn't a lie that's like out of the box put it in a motherboard it's doing 320 Watts I mean with a 360 mil a we're we're just vibing at like
85 I'm going to restart this thing and turn all the limits off but in the meantime let's look at the labs results because that's more proper testing than I just did right there but I was right it draws a lot of power let's see if it actually performs any better now before I look at these Labs results I'm going to look at the price $700 oh my God a 14 900k kind of the current retail suggested price is 560 which makes this a $140 up charge oh my God it's even more than a 7950 X not that that is a
well-priced CPU presently but geez let's look at how it performs I bet you it's not going to be $140 more Hey look it's not oh my God is it even better like cyberpunk exact same performance as the non-ks F12 2023 three more FPS average Red Dead two more FPS average the average of all of the games put together one additional FPS it's it's weird to think that like 200 MHz more is not a big deal anymore but when you think about it when you're already talking 6 gigahertz you know bumping up
200 MHz more is it's a lot smaller percentage and it it shows I mean God look at that non-gaming tests it's actually slower in some circumstances probably because it's thermal throttling would be my guess it's really going to depend on the cooler you have definitely make sure you're running this thing on like 360 mil AIO I mean can an nhd15 even run this thing anymore probably not sort of can sort of can yeah you basically just need a water cooler now just just custom cool your computer
you're spending $700 on a CPU I mean why not right uh let's see yeah okay with the ryuen 3 360 cin 202 the average was 87° on the 4900 K with a Max of 100 if you turn on MCE with no limits 96° average 105° Max it's pretty much across the board at least 10° hotter it's actually more than 10° 13° hotter than a 1400 K I mean that makes sense we're talking like 250 watt to 320 wat power limit increase here so yes it's going to be hotter naturally oh my God you guys measured 3
67 Watts Peak during the cin bench run with MCE on oh my god that's literally more power than a thread Ripper will draw without turning PBO on that's insane I mean if you look across the board in terms of the amount of power you're consuming per frames you are kind of delusional to go intel if you live anywhere where power costs money is that safe to say I don't know maybe if you live with your parents you get free Power right that's how that works I don't oh God it's somehow slower in cine
bench multicore which is interesting the single core of course is like a couple points higher literally four points across the board I could see these variations in just buying multiple CPUs we've seen our own variations at least on AMD that were this large or larger even but let's see how how ridiculous it is in person remove all limits no temp let's go it reminds me of when when they came out with the 5 GHz 8 core and everyone was like oh my God that's so much power oh if we only knew where we were headed
233 358 389 389 oh my  it's at 102° though you're you're just at a point where regardless of how much you know how many radiators you have the size of the die is not big enough for this much power unless you're delting this thing and like direct die cooling or you're putting probably a copper IHS on it or something like that we're getting down after a little bit of chilling here 370 watts is and just just casually idling at um 102° it's actually Beyond wow look at that oh God you know
what it occurs to me we have a 4090 here what is a 490 Vibe at like 600 watts 500 watts this is almost a kilowatt of power draw I guess if you you take the power supply efficiency in there too you're basically at a kilowatt of power drop if you were able or using an application that would load both your CPU and your GPU weren't we supposed to be saving the planet or something it's not really faster aside from like a percent or two I don't even know what to say I mean props to Intel congratulations smack on
the back you made the world's fastest technically speaking frequency CPU if only it was the fastest everywhere else it it is very expensive it is very high on power drw unless you're just like the dude that wants to have the most balling his CPU at the L party it's a flex thing it's like the 8086k you know it's it's purely just for Ballers if you hate money you want to light it on fire do it but otherwise don't pleas please it's like I went on Amazon and sorted by most expensive
that's who the CPU is for I'm a little sad it's it's basically the last monolithic Intel CPU I can't imagine they're going to be releasing anything else like definitely not top tier it's the end of an era it's it's just this is the most that this could do this is the sendoff it's like when a rocket ship launches and it explodes midair before it gets there that's what this feels like because it was hot good job Intel and good job for you for watching hit the like button get subscribed maybe
even check out the video that was also hot because we were in a hot tub it was not heated bye
