do you guys remember smellivision that kind of concept that came out since TVs have been around where you can smell the media you're listening to well this is that but for video games wow this is a lot bigger than it looks in the photos actually this is called the game scent and it can dispense up to six different smells using I know everyone's least favorite word AI but that way it's actually compatible with every video game or movie we'll get into that a little bit further but let's look at the
rest in the box we have our audio stream adapter so this is actually what the AI part is using here and last but not oh I can already smell it these are the six cents that it comes with here including racing cars apparently it comes with six but they have way more listed on the box such as Napal human exertion ocean golf course I've never been to a golf course so I can't really speak on that one there we have gunfire this is the one I think that is like the default one you're supposed to use all
the time we also have explosions Forest I don't know how that would be much different than golf course but it's green right clean air oh yeah this one you can actually use if you want to get rid of all the rest of the odors what does it blast into the air to cancel it we'll find out uh and storm and then pulling out our audio stream adapter here wow this is really like really light I'm is there anything in there it's got an onoff switch an audio port an HDMI out an HDMI in and an audio
in and that's because again this is the box that does all the AI calculations so you just plug your device into this and then able to run this to your speakers or your TV down the line so let's look at the actual core part which is the  inside oh my goodness that's how you get it open it's very tough I guess this is where you can put your six cents and like I said gunfire is right there so I think that one you can't change we'll go into the app a little bit later but the rest of them you just pull them out
they're these kind of little straw looking things and they have some Pogo pins on them as well that connect with Pogo pins in here and that's how it will send the signal to hey make it smell like War so we're going to plug in our audio stream adapter and even though it has an HDMI it actually doesn't use any of the video signal to help tell what it sent it's going to release it only extracts the audio from HDMI in our case because we're not going to a different TV we're just going to plug in the 3.5
mm Jack here plugging into the audio inside and our headphone jack plugging in our USB for power in and USB awesome now all we should have to do hold the power button for 2 seconds and then the light will go on hey there we go and we're since again we're going to be using the 3.5 we're going to actually make sure we switch it to the audio not the HDMI signal there okay so this is actually an adapter that is able to go with your consoles reason being is your headset cable might need
to actually break out so that way you can have both your headset and this device plugged in at the same time so they give you a nice little y splitter there that's kind of cool so that way this is really close to your console this goes all the way to your head and now we power up the big boy plugging in our USBC power all right let's turn this bad boy on you have to hold the power  app it's on so using the game sent app that's where you're going to go in and actually pair both this device and this
device to your Wi-Fi network and then from there once it's paired you actually get to see all six of your scents here and this is where you can also then change and customize them but they're not in there right now so I don't really know why it's at 99% I guess maybe when we actually put the scent in we'll find out but this is also where you can customize and change it so if I was to hold a explosive cuz I bought the blood scent I could CH oh blood's not even in there neither is what did you just shoot 
you that is a horrible horrible smell it smells like old gunfire it doesn't smell like gunfire just happened which is kind of weird but I guess we'll actually plug in the bottle and find out here where's my gunfire are the bottles themselves just little oh okay that's kind kind of cute 1.69 Oz nice let's open this bad boy up because how you install these is then you'll take your atomizer part you put it sorry oh crap it's really strong I don't know how oh man it's a weird smell I don't know how to describe
it can you guys smell it from there it smells like someone's clothes red of marijuana and they sprayed cologne on them well there you go that's gunfire apparently marijuana and cologne all right so you then you just screw your cap on here nice and tight and then you can place it back in and boom gunfire is installed will it refresh and show me that I'm at 100% now no I'm still at 99% but that's okay let's get the rest of them installed really quick whoa that looks like someone
did that would have been bad this looks like someone did not drink enough water throughout the day this is racing cars so maybe it'll smell like petrol and  smells like urine maybe that's where the color came from but guess or no definitely no asparagus all right now that that's all installed we'll put our cap back on top and we're going to try triggering it manually through the app you can just unpause it and then click on one of them such as  oo that one's pretty good that one
smells like it did when I opened the bottle just smells like you just went out for a nice walk sto warm okay that one does not smell as nice it smells kind of like detergent clean air well that one went off for a long time I see how it could be refreshing but it does not clean the rest of the scents that are around me right now this probably isn't healthy right I'm basically just breathing gamer Vape juice we're going to see how that AI actually works in game here pretty quick

environment oh there you go that's the  one I am much more immersed now guys I can't imagine imine people actually wanting to game like this but I guess it's kind of a cool concept lonus actually opened one very similar on the LTT channel four years ago and I think he probably came to the same conclusion I didn't watch that video this is very interesting and it's kind of limiting that you only get six cents but maybe we'll get some more in a bit I'm drifting through bushes now I want to
trigger the forest effect the smell does linger though like I I it's kind of filling this whole space with just a mix of smells right now and it's not very pleasant I won't lie I'm not sure how clean is detected if clean air is one that I always have to trigger or if clean air will go also based off whatever its AI model thinks it is there we go now we're in like a wooded forest area so now the forest smell has to go right I hit a tree does that help dang it now you might be thinking just plug
into the HDMI right but like I said it only takes the HDMI audio I kind of wish  nice now I'm immersed sorry I got distracted there I think what I would like to see maybe they can do it through updates or something is it actually uses vision of some sort to look and go oh yeah that's a tree we'll give you more more Forest now but as of right now it only triggered once so I have a massive headache right now by the way this the scent is very overwhelming should we try red dead so we can get gunfire so far I
don't think I would just casually set this in my living room and invite friends over to play Red Dead I'm curious I'm going to refresh the cartridges here I want to see if it's used no they're still all at 99% which is fine apparently all the bottles claim "they can do between 4 and 5,000 sprays" which if it's triggering once every 60 seconds or so that seems like it could actually last you like a pretty good amount of time they don't have prices for just the cents though yet online
they have the price for the whole kit which comes with the six it says they're going to offer the sents separately but if you go on their Amazon store or their website it it doesn't link you to anything yet it only links you to the device as a whole honestly the website as a whole feels very not complete and it makes me kind of wonder what the future of this device even is if you were to buy into it now the more I smell each scent though the worse they get oh there we go
all right Arthur Morgan let's go shoot some people so we can test the gunfire this should trigger it oh there we go gunfire smells like the Wild West oh crap I'm going to die the storm is really bad here see now the storm should go off but maybe it's cuz it's a winter storm it's not the same oh okay I guess it did trigger so those last two games were actually repped on their website but once again they claim any game so we're going to try Counter Strike so we can get the last one to go
off which is explosion I'm kidding I'm not going to play with track pad I want to actually oh oh it triggered explosion doesn't smell like I've smelled that one before what have you ever been exploded that's true I've  go hey there you go there's gunfire all right buy grenade I'm going to throw this grenade in this corner and I want   trigger that's an explosion it still smells like the marijuana and clone like I it doesn't smell like I mean again I've never held a hand grenade trying to
trigger gunfire now there we go they do smell different gunfire and explosion I think gunfire is an easier scent to my nose explosion makes me want to throw up a little bit the way I would describe gunfire is there's less marijuana and more cologne and the way I would describe explosion is there's more marijuana and less cologne both are not pleasant though and I don't know if I would just casually play Counter Strike with them going off it's supposed to work with any type of media right so we
should be able to just go YouTube it's got an advertisement okay what does an ad smell like there's like birds chirp oh hey it  Forest it's like I'm right there with them whoa okay it is really distorting my audio it's doing this weird style sound that's really disappointing but let's try uh let's try like a trailer here oh that was prime time for the racing to go off really just showed a car like driving and drifting for being a racing trailer it has not triggered the racing sound effect or the racing
smell oh there we go now we got racing I don't know if that's the smell I would just use to describe the scene I just saw though and I think that's a big takeaway from this is just because it's a racing smell that scene was more of a burnout and I didn't smell a burnout so it's not quite oh gunfire the scene was over for about 10 seconds there so we saw it work in some situations but not others but does that make it a bad or good product I don't know it's $150 right now on Amazon that comes with the
6 cents that you saw here today and maybe if each bottle is $10 a refill that's okay $60 to fill the whole thing I don't know it's going to only matter on how long they last and if they even start selling the bottles in the first place cuz you might just be a onetime use and my other thought is I don't see people just casually setting this up and having it in their house or their room maybe the market is streamers or YouTubers that are trying to do a I smelled my video game challenge I think
even if in a perfect situation everything worked great the smells were able to get bought again I don't think I could have this in my house I $150 is a lot of money for a gimmick and that didn't really add to my experience I didn't feel more immersed when the gunfire went off or when the racing went off I just kind of got annoyed in a headache and another thing to be considered about is if you live with someone sure in my audio I can turn my headphones down or I can turn my
speakers down I can't turn the smell down and if I'm in an 800 foot apartment or something everyone's going to start smelling this if you wanted better immersion for $150 maybe go check out that short circuit on the elite controller we did it's got paddles the vibrations way better in it it's a pretty good video
