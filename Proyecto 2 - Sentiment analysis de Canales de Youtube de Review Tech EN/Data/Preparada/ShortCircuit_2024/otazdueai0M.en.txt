this monitor is less than half the area of my current desktop display and yet by the end of this video I might be ready to downgrade obviously not everything about the 2725 DF from Alienware is a downgrade some things are pretty big upgrades starting of course with the panel I mean none of this sounds that newer exciting QD OLED from Samsung display seen it QHD sounds like 4K for poor people 360 HZ baby call me when you got 500 except in the real world that's just not how it works products can be more
than the sum of their parts and this one is a lot more and if I hadn't been putting on my best toxic elitist Persona before there were some hints on the packaging for example this 03 millisecond response time check check out this Pursuit camera test it looks like a still image this thing offers some of if not the best motion Clarity we have ever seen on a display that doesn't use a cathode ray tube to be clear any OLED is going to be fast much faster than any LCD but this takes
things to a whole other level the next big hint is that 99.3% coverage of the DCI P3 color space that in and of itself doesn't make a monitor good you could have a wide gamut display that whether due to poor Factory calibration or just bad product design philosophy with gross you know Vivid Best Buy display model syndrome just isn't accurate but this one is friends I am talking in SDR a maximum Delta e out of the box of. n when two is considered fine for professional work and in HDR some of the
best color ACC accuracy we have ever seen on a display ever remember when gaming monitors had compromises yeah me neither anymore a lot of this performance just comes down to Dell's decision to use a third generation 2024 model QD OLED panel from Samsung we've got a full video on that over on the LT Channel where you can learn more of the ins and outs of it it's sponsored by Samsung display but all of the numbers in it were measured by our team here in our own lab on these Alienware monitors
which I am very excited to be able to tell you guys about because they were still under embargo when we did that video and the thing is there's more to making a good monitor than just the panel that you integrate there's the design and accessory package this one has integrated Cable Management includes display port HDMI display port to USBC and a USB A2B Uplink cable for the integrated Hub which has I believe it's uh three type A ports one on the bottom two on the back and one type c it even
comes with a little built-in cleaning cloth which allows us to most easily see the biggest disadvantage of Cu OLED you see that kind of purple cast on the screen unlike a wed which is LG's competing technology ciola doesn't quite get black black especially in a brightly lit environment like the studio we're in right now it's not going to affect you in your mom's dimly lit basement or whatever because like other OLED displays when these pixels are black they're off no light so in Vasa true
black 400 mode or whatever it is this thing will do 500 knits of brightness that next to a little bit of purple you're not going to see it and you're especially not going to see it in the "1,000 nit Peak brightness mode that" it'll do I believe up to a 2% window but it is something to be aware of because actually this is perfect I've got my laptop here for comparison it just isn't quite as B black there are also some other compromises compared to this monitor's bigger 4 ker brother and
that's aside from just the size and resolution it doesn't have any g-sync validation of any sort just freesync premium Pro though I'm not really convinced that matters we enabled gsync with it before and it seemed to work fine just fine the bigger one is that because it doesn't have the same increased pixel density compared to the last one you're going to see more of the text fringing that people had talked about particularly with the previous generation of this panel technology it's
improved but not nearly as much as the 4K model of course I wouldn't be saying that I'm considering upgrading to this one if I thought that any of these were deal breakers and compared to the 240 htz of that bigger display oh the 360 is just so smooth shouldn't matter that much but man guys when I was shooting that last video like I was just putting together kill streaks like like I couldn't miss and uh I guess this is my chance to prove it I going to swap out this mouse I'm not saying this is a
bad Mouse I'm just saying it's not my mouse and I would like to use mine there it is and I also found this message from our sponsor thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our 2024 CES coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include power supplies case fans PC cases for said case fans all-in-one water coolers and and high performance air coolers with fruits in Germany they've been in the industry for
more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are hard to hear be quiet this year at CES they're showcasing new white PC cases white fans and even white hard drive cages step into the world of quiet cooling with be quiet at the link down below actually before we play games I should probably poke around in the settings a little bit first up is it running at 360 HZ yes it's just crazy seeing that number like that also we can poke around in the menu a little bit we're in HDR Peak 1000
mode this is cool you've got a little panel Health indicator here they offer a threeyear no burning warranty it's kind of neat are you kidding me are you kidding me Microsoft sign in with a different Microsoft account what does that mean it means a different one I  password this has been a bug for at least 2 years get it together go to control panel at the bottom and sign out press F1 what control panel I have no control panel other ways to sign in nope unbelievable this is the
workaround to remove these credential manager credentials I I don't know how to describe this other than unbelievable we even got pl's password Here want to want to show want to show them the the thing Colin enter the enter the password let's show them the stupid loop I hope someone from Microsoft is watching and  immediately here's another I can't play this game sign in is blocked I just tried to sign in as my own account someone entered the wrong password to many time what what are you talking
about that's not a thing that happened guarantee you I can sign into that on my laptop right now what well when did that happen finally confirmed with ploof for some reason his locked after one attempt as well so something about doing anything with your account on this machine just immediately locks your Microsoft account and makes it so you have to reset your password genius anyway we're in hack the main frame not in a gaming mindset anymore now I have an excuse for not being good
I have no sound but hopefully I'm going to be able to make this work I don't know what it is you know it's not about hurts it's about the smoothness and the motion Clarity you know like it's just it's impossible not to click the guy like it's it's crazy guys I don't think I have to convince anyone that I'm not this good at video games like it's just it's crazy where'd it come from I don't know this map I also have no sound I'm using that as a legit excuse when I don't know
where my opponent's coming from whoa whoa whoa whoa got him come on where's my headset seriously though you guys have seen me play games before I am not this good oh I fell see see someone who falls off the map should not be getting head shot like that if I wasn't seeing this I wouldn't believe it or rather if I wasn't living it I wouldn't believe it I have the most kills in the server with no sound got him oh already popped his Shields now he's dead how dare you how oh wow they're all uh see that's
the these guys problem they are always  dead man just I swear guys I cannot click heads like that and yet there it is I don't think I have in my memory encountered a piece of equipment that has affected my ability to game like this before like it's just so easy to track things it's not going to compensate for not knowing your way around maps and stuff you know but just it does compensate for just being able to see and track objects on the screen better it's crazy yeah we tried what I be most
interested to see is if there's a difference in my hit percentage I suspect there is but I think that's only during Deathmatch modes so I don't know what to tell you other than to subscribe to Short Circuit
