we've all been there you've finally saved up the money to buy a new Ballin gaming monitor but how do you decide do I go high resolution a little bit lower refresh rate do I go really high refresh rate but lower resolution well it doesn't matter anymore azrock who sponsored this video to check out their Phantom gaming pgo 32 UF s2b 32in 4K 240 HZ OLED gaming monitor it's no longer a problem because despite being all that this is also a 1080p 480 HZ 32-in OLED gaming monitor it's dual mode it does
both this is the new avatar game it is absolutely stunning running on this wonderful ASRock taichi computer we've got a 7950 X x670 taichi Carrera and a 7900 XTX taichi but you don't always play games like this sometimes your game is a little less beautiful and it has a lot more valves in it and in those ones you need High refresh rates I would show you but I don't actually have that game installed and the internet's really here but for Illustrated purposes let's switch it so
the buttons are backwards Up Is Down Down is up right is left left is right it's going to look so much better after I promise okay it doesn't actually look that different but look our F our FPS doubled like magic this was 4K before I promise you 480 HZ woo look at how smooth all right we figured out the Pinnacle of Esports game CS 1.6 it it might not be CS2 it's point4 behind that but we can at least see what an Esports game which is something you might actually want 480 HZ looks like super
clear hello oh God I'm by myself what imagine there's other people I am fragging them so hard because I have way more hurts than them specs Wise It's vesa HDR true black 400 certified it's got a Max brightness in HDR mode of 1300 nits Peak for iio we've got two HDMI 2.1 ports that's always a nice touch sometimes they end up with an HDMI 2.1 for one port and then 2.0 on the other this one 2.1 on both it's also going to have two display port 1.4s right now this engineering sample only has the one
but the final production ones will have two we've got a type-c port that does DP alt mode and 65 W PD charging a USB type a hub and audio output on top of that they also include a Wi-Fi antenna hookup on the monitor so if you're somebody that uses Wi-Fi uh having it on your monitor can actually be a really good way to get better signal cuz it's Up and Away instead of like tucked away at the back of your computer a nice touch if you happen to need to use it oh look at that there's the Wi-Fi it right there
it's got a fairly good range of motion tilting up and down moving up and down and swiveling left to right it doesn't pivot though and of course a 100x 100 vase amount which is always a nice touch waa it's got RGB and a Kensington lock which is always nice I also like it's got the nipple that's the best way to have a monitor thing I hate when they just have a bajillion buttons this is so much better let's try smooth frog which is like a Clarity demo obviously this doesn't necessarily translate the best
over camera but Dennis tried to do some Pursuit cvas but it looks very clear I don't really see any sort of ghosting in the colors or anything like that it looks pretty good now I would love to play an HDR video but unfortunately this engineering sample doesn't yet have the HDR functionality built in so if we go to enable HDR it will be like no HDR in the future obviously if you buy one it's going to have HDR so don't stress about that and if you are planning on watching
HDR content or video editing or anything like that it has coverage of 98.5% of the DCI P3 color space which is excellent let's show you the Dual mode one more time we were in 1080P mode for all of that let's go back to 4K just did it in the onscreen menu there couple seconds and bam we're at 4K 240 it still looks really smooth don't get me wrong 4K 240 is really good but it's not only monitors they have a full lineup of new motherboards for both the latest Intel and AMD platforms that are launching
like look at this Intel taichi Aqua it has 10 USBC ports and no taipe what kind of Madness is this or x870 E taichi if you're looking for those latest AMD chips but I also heard there's an azrock motherboard in a very interesting system over here hey guys been a while I think this is actually my premiere on the short circuit Channel although I'm not 100% sure Jake pulled me out of retirement to check out this system I don't think it particularly has a name yet this is a a prototype it's not ready
for for Showtime yet but first let's go over the hardware inside cuz that'll explain a few things later on about why they chose some design decisions that they have inside of it is a Zeon W9 3495 x 2 96 gig sticks of Kingston ddr5 memory a 2 TB Samsung SSD dual Radeon RX 7800 XT gpus a thermal 1650 W power supply and of course we're here at azrock thank you azrock for bringing us to the show this year a azrock w790 WS now the immersion liquid cooling the thing that I was really brought here for
what's going on with that this is not mineral oil this is significantly more expensive and better one of the notes that you'll actually see on the card is that they say compatible with most material that's a bit of an immediate issue with mineral oil because it eats things like rubbers and and other stuff like that this doesn't have that problem one potential problem if you wanted to use this self however is that just this amount of liquid that's in the case right now would cost you somewhere
"between 2,000 and $2500" us W it makes sense when if you go back to that parts list just that CPU the Zeon W9 3495 X that's on that ASRock motherboard is going to cost probably more than your entire system that you have at home so you're probably going to want to cool it with something pretty good now again this is a a test a prototype a proof of concept this is this isn't final version most plural carbon immersion systems they're actually sealed this one has open ventilation on the top and I've I've
heard tell that they're doing some experimental things trying to work on that but uh this system here has had about a TENS width of fluid evaporated from it in a week and when the fluid costs this much you don't want that to happen but that isn't actually normally a huge problem with these types of systems and I'm sure they can solve it because most of them are actually completely sealed so that there is no loss from evaporation everything in the system that is being touched by the oil
is being cooled fural carbon has very high thermal conductivity and can pull that out to this stack of Radiators that's in the back and those radiators can cool down the oil cycle it back in there's no real recycle time as far as my understanding goes if you have it nicely sealed your levels aren't going down you can leave it in here basically forever and it will keep doing its job which is very nice now will you see me using this per cural carbon fluid in a personal rig update sometime soon no
probably not it's a little expensive for my taste but I think it's cool that I got to see one in person I haven't done that before usually they're big 42u server racks completely sealed and data centers and I don't know get to see that fun stuff and I like that they're putting it in a nice attractive form factor a nice attractive package speaking of which you can find one of those in the link down below from azrock thank you azrock for bringing us to the show this year like comment subscribe
all that fun stuff I don't know how to out videos anymore see you later
