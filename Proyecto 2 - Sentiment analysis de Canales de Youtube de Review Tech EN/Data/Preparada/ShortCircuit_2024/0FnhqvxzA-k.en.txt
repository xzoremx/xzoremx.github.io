EVS can be many things blindingly fast quiet and comfortable or for the most part just plain boring but not a single person is going to say that about what we have here today cuz this right here oh my God it's the ionic 5n and it is the best eveve I have ever driven because it somehow manages to be fun Hyundai's end division is just off the chain insane I don't know what they are thinking giving this to the public but man am I ever glad that they did let's have a look the ionic 5 was already an
excellent looking car we've got these pixel looking headlights here but it's sort of like you take one of those and a gaming laptop and smash them together and this is what you get it's 50 mm wider and just so much fiercer looking we have it in performance blue which I think looks great popping the hood we can see that there is no frunk but just loads of motor on underneath there and also easy access to your 12volt battery which is nice cuz that's just hidden somewhere stupid in some EVS moving
around to the side we have 21in forged rims that are wrapped in pelli P0 that are 275s they are freaking massive and you definitely need that given how much power this thing has and of course if you're going fast you need to be stopping fast which is why we have these massive two-piece rotors and some red painted four piston calipers that you know are going to stop you good moving to the doors the handles will do a little wave to you if you so want but they do have the absolute laziest backup
key implementation that I have ever seen I don't know why I can't go in here this thing's absolutely massive but if you need to it can go in right there here we've got a rear air curtain and around the back we have an absolutely massive diffuser it sticks off the back making this thing 4 point 7 m long and popping open the trunk we've got these beautiful cool looking brake lights and a pretty decent amount of storage in here although we don't get any extra bonus storage because down in here we have the
subwoofer for our Bose sound system one place that Hyundai has really enhanced the ionic 5 for 2025 oh my God would you look at that it has a rear wiper it really needed one before and especially with this massive spoiler that we have here this thing gets really dirty really fast this thing is built on 800 volt architecture which allows you fast charging from 10 to 80% in just 18 minutes which you'll probably want to do because the rated range of this thing is 355 km and given how you are going to be
driving it you will be getting less than that I guarantee you also very soon this should be converted to nacs but it is not for 20 25 so maybe you want to wait a little bit hopping into the rear seats you can move them forward if you hate leg room you can recline them if you want to be nice and relaxed overall it is quite nice to sit in here I have plenty of Headroom even though the floor is raised up a little bit so my legs they wouldn't hate being a tiny bit lower we also have two cup holders two
USBC Chargers and a manual privacy screen if you want to not see any of your haters hopping into the driver's seat we have shockingly good seats and I mean that in the sense that they are very aggressive bucket seats they have little holes here so you can put a fivepoint harness in if you are properly tracking this thing they really hold you in Place full manual you do not get any seat memory at all but what you do get is heated and ventilation the only thing that I wish that they had was some
adjustable lumbar support but it's not you're going to be sitting in these particularly long given the range of it that said though overall I am super impressed with these seats and I very happy that they put them in even if it does feel kind of weird being in this like hardcore bucket seat and then looking around and being like oh wow I on an SUV that the passengers like a whole Arms Reach away for the center console they seem to have just completely given up on the idea of
having a bunch of space in the center cuz probably no one used it anyway we've got two cup holders down here that you can disappear if you don't want them we have heaps of chargers three of them and 12vt Supply one thing that is rather annoying is that down here we have a button to change this USB port on the left from data or tojust power and I just hit it all the time by accident like look you are putting your phone in here and it's just so easy to be like Boop and if you do that or just break
really hard your Android auto gets turned off unless you have wireless enabled which I do now but it was really annoying until I did that extra step if you don't want to be plugged in though there is a wireless charger that I've never seen work what does work well is this little storage compartment right here and we also have a fully functional glove box featuring nothing dumb which for whatever reason is a plus in an EV what is kind of dumb though is everything here but dumb in the best
kind of way this steering wheel and kind of just the entire car is incredibly confusing there are so many modes so many different things to try out but now I just have it all dialed in and oh my God is it ever good we have our end gauge cluster up here there are different options but just use this one it is by far the best we have our drive mode select which you are just probably never going to use because we have our end mode select down here which gives you all of the modes that you actually
want cuz we have our end mode then we have our custom one and custom 2 having two Customs is great because you can just tell it turn off my traction control when I press this button this thing is pretty wild especially when you have so much power it will turn those tires into rubber on the road on the right side of the steering wheel we have NGB which stands for nrin Boost gives you an extra 40 horsepower for 10 seconds and if I am honest I don't really notice the difference cuz you are
so traction Limited it anyway and down here we have a second end button which enables our fake engine which is really quite a good bit of fun also what is quite fun is just playing with the obscene number of settings that they have in their custom menus one of the things that has really annoyed me with electric cars is the fact that an electric motor is incredibly easy to change how it reacts you can very easily just go in change some numbers and be like wow the whole feeling of driving is
completely different now but for the most part everyone is just like here's one drive mode maybe you get to enable creep or not it is very disappointing that they go with it just being super easy when it could be incredibly customizable for the people that want to and oh my god do they ever give you a lot of options in here so looking at the main menu we have end torque distribution that allows you to change how much of the power is being sent to the front and the back we also have our
n pedal which allows you to have up to 0.6 G's of regenerative braking now this right here does have a little warning on it saying to only use it on the track and for the most part I have gotten very used to just ignoring warnings like that but man you have to be careful when nend pedal is on they are not kidding that it really transfers the weight to those front wheels and if you're not paying attention it will catch you out we also have n race right here which provides
better cooling to the batteries and more current duration although it might cause a bit of degradation to your batteries oh well and we have n drift Optimizer which I have not been playing around with CU we have not been on a track in here we also have N battery which allows you to have drag mode which will increase the temperature of your battery a little bit so that it is absolutely optimal for just ripping down the straights we also have track mode which is more for cooling your battery so you
can be on the gas really hard for longer coming into here we have two custom modes where you can just change all types of things we also have launch control which we will see in a second this being a very silly car you're able to choose what type of a sound you want your fake engine to have so here it's kind of like a normal Hyundai 4cylinder in their end Vehicles evolution is more like a Strange Electric race car and Super Sonic is an even stranger electronic race car of sorts it is all very good
fun but if you don't want it yeah there it is completely gone also in here the infotainment is just typical Hyundai Kia sort of stuff and very easy to use for the most part I am just slapping an Android auto we've got a nice big 12.3 in screen rate here and it all works great we also have not physical climate controls but they all stay in the same place so you can get used to it well enough and plenty of physical controls for volume tuning setup all that sort of stuff I have had no problems with just
using this car overall it is excellent for just daily use if you want to be an absolute hooligan or just comfortable on your way to work oh Andy do you know I think the business team would really love if this is how we segue to our spawn answer drop thanks to drop for sponsoring this video their hex gaming headset in collaboration with epos is a budget friendly option that works with PCS and consoles it's closed back build treats your ears to a clean isolated Sound Stage for in-game cues and it has

and is able to accomplish that by having 641 horsepower 4 six of which is directed just to the rear wheels let's just have a little taste of this orange NGB button and just oh my God I really like the sound of this thing it's like a Dremel or an electric toothbrush on steroids when you hit it like that's the actual sound of the electric motors it's just this thing is brutally fast it is quite funny because when you don't have a whole lot of grip on the road that you in it feels a lot like a high power
front-wheel drive car you kind of get torque steer and it's trying to steer you off into the ditch it is hilarious speaking of very funny let's just dip into the gears here this has a simulated 8-speed dual clutch so we can come in here and drop into second gear and go all the way down turn my cap around around and I am now a Honda driver I am driving my Honda excellently and this is exactly how you do it for real though this this a lot of fun it is shockingly convincing that you
have an actual engine and exhaust and stuff like I know that it is not real but at the same time I don't particularly care like have you ever had fun in a racing game before it is a very similar thing to this and it is quite a  fun now of course is it as good as a real engine and exhaust no of course it isn't but it is absolutely comical and if you are done having fun like that you can just press this button and wow it just is completely silent in here one of my favorite things about this is that you
can soften the dampers up it'll be just really nice comfortable for your drive to work and then you hit some corners and be like oh look at this it steers so well oh my God for an electric car the handling of this is shocking oh it is so much more fun than it deserves to be and it is so much more competent  being at being best at both of what it is able to do something like the poar 2 is incredibly fast and Incredibly brutal and Incredibly competent in the corners but it's never able to just be an easy
family Cruiser like we are in right now where this right here I feel like it knows that it is a great big electric SUV it has that sort of luxury feeling to it but it also is just so absolutely comical drifting the ti can was a whole lot of fun but you can't do that on normal roads that thing is so fast that you just immediately get impounded this is also brutally fast but with the gears and all of that stuff you can have fun on normal roads and like really toss it around I love it I love this thing it
has so much personality once you're done listening to your simulated engine maybe you want to listen to some excellent music and this right here definitely has that in here we have the eight- speaker sound system from Bose and it sounds really freaking good we've got two speakers in the doors Two tweeters up there and a center channel you also have that sub in the back and two rear speakers which doesn't sound like a whole lot but it's not the number of speakers that counts it's what they can
do and man this sounds excellent I measured it and it goes all the way down to 30 htz so you have plenty of base and even though it does look a bit exaggerated around 100 to 200 htz it  good now of course if you want to be headbanged to your music instead of looking at the road we have Hyundai's typical Suite of fantastic driver assistance we have our cruise control here which just works really well like everything else that they make it has excellent ability to just see something
in front of you slow down stop I have plenty of confidence in it it also will have Lane centering which is pretty good but I personally prefer to just to drive my own cars and it's going to be safe it has the safety crap and if you don't want it you can just fully turn it off and you can run into the person in front of you on the racetrack if you so choose so overall this thing is just comical in ways I did not know an EV could be there's stuff like the tie can and the Lucid air which will scare you with
their speed but do you know what you can't do in those have the hilarious little gearbox that won't let you keep on going even though the powertrain can just because it's funny this thing is such a great little machine and for 66 Grand US I think if you have the money just do it it's it's so freaking good like compared to a model wide performance the amount of fun that I have in this thing not to mention the fact that it's really a more comfortable ride when it wants to be
this is the easiest pick ever for me I really wish we could take this thing on track it would be hilarious and I also wish I could take you to the end of this video wait I did huge thanks for watching hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day
