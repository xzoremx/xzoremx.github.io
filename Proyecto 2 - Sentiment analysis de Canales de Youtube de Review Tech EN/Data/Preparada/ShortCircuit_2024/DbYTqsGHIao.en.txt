we're here at Monex booth at computex 2024 where they have sponsored a video where we're going to look at a whole whack of cases that they have that look really quite nice and also are all very reasonably priced this one right here is the hs01 mini and as you can see it is quite a pretty little guy now this right here it is not real leather you don't really want to screw around with that if you're you know shipping to a whole bunch of different countries moisture can be annoying and you didn't have to
kill animals for so that's a plus but what we have here is a 32 L case that has up to ATX support now we aren't able to fit in ATX with the fans on the bottom but we can come in here this is a prototype they all seem a little bit concerned about me just taking it apart right now but it's it's fine but the layout is really smart so right now it is set up for an matx build and that is what it's designed for but you can take out these fans on the bottom and fit a full ATX motherboard if you so choose
and you also have support for a 360 mm radio up at the top and we have our power supply at the front now this setup here is good for like a 4080 4070 something like that but if you have a big boy 4090 you are going to run into the power supply fortunately though if you take out this fan and want only a 240 mm radiator you can move the whole power supply up which will give you enough clearance for a GPU to just go all the way across this guy you can have an insane amount of power in something
that is just this big that's just so pretty coming around to the back we can see that we have back to front support like every good case in 2024 and we also have fans on the side and the cable management it's it's going to be a little bit of a struggle but you'll be able to figure it out especially when you find it this thing is just $96 and that includes four prein stalled fans three in the bottom and one in the back heck yeah but if you're not looking for a small case here we have the
hsl1 not mini it's just the hs01 and it is really neat now the main thing that they have done here is played around once again with where the power supply goes so if you look it's actually up here right at the top and what allows them to do is sink down fans into the bottom which helps a little bit with performance and a lot of bit with it just looking kind kind of cool and really unique like moving over here to the fully built system it's just a really unique look one thing that's fun
is that if you look this RGB strip that's along the bottom is actually connected with Pogo pins so you can just take it off works great the pins are right there put it back on Boom your RGB works again one thing that's also cool is if you look on the front these fans have two options of where exactly they go right now they're centered which looks good for just looking good sake but you can remove these two screws up here and move it to the left which gives you a tiny bit more
performance sacrificing just and not being quite in the middle looking in the back we can see this great big fan and RGB Hub which does come included and also you can see just how strange the power supply is right there but it does allow pretty easy cable management and of course we do have back to front support here as well one thing that was a little bit of oversight on this prototype is that right now you cannot access the power button on the power supply but in the future and when this
is actually available there will be a nice big hole here so you can plug it unplug it and just hit that button if you want moving back around to the front one of the things that is fun is that they have a really streamlined look where you have all of your like chunky connectors and stuff down here if your motherboard wasn't back to front and they have just this nice little panel right here which just covers that up so you don't need to see those cables you can get the hs01 in either black or
silver they're the same price and it comes with five RGB fans for just $99 not too bad but maybe you have a little bit more money specifically $20 more money and you want to spend that on curved glass look at this I cannot believe that they're able to get curved glass in into a case that has that kind of a price tag cuz I know a lot of Manufacturers have talked about just how hecking expensive it can be they said that they're able to heat up the glass and do the curving and the process is
still a little bit difficult about 80% of them are fine but 20% of them just kind of explode while they're making them but the good news is once they are made and installed none of them have exploded afterwards so you don't have to worry about that at all what's also really cool here is that below the curved glass they have two 80 mm fans that they say deliver about a 1 to 2° drop in temperatures on your GPU because you don't want to be a saggy boy they do include a GPU bracket from the factory
and also five fans so the 2 80 mm right here two 140s on the side and a 140 on the back moving around to the back you can see that we have back to front support once again and you will be getting a control but more like the one that we saw before not this one specifically if you're willing to sacrifice that nice curved glass for a little bit of performance though we have the sky 3 Performance right here except so probably good idea it's a prototype all right I'll leave it with this guy
you get three 140 mm fans in the front a 120 in the back and that same GPU saggy thing and also a little bit of maybe Walnut right here they're not 100% sure what type of wood this is going to be because you need to pick a type of wood that's going to be fine in Asia where it's hot and humid and Europe and Canada where it's really cold and not humid and also import laws and they'll figure it out what it's a bit harder to figure out though is how they managed to make the king 65 Pro be so inexpensive this is
apparently the cheapest dual chamber case coming in at $89 not bad let's have a look in here as you can see tempered glass on two sides very very nice and there we go your power supply has its own little area to do its thing we have some fans that are intaking through there so all of your other stuff can stay nice and cool unfortunately there is no back to front support in this guy here but there is support for hard drives if you still have those for some reason in here if
you are to buy it you will get 240 mm fans on the side and a 120 at the back for that $89 price tag which is pretty hecking good also looks like we have room for a 360 rat up there 360 down here very nice for those of you that want to spend very little on your computer case though and more on your components we have the XR Series this one right here with the two glass panels comes in at $64 very nice and even nicer the one with mesh on the front comes with four 120s the not mesh version glass panel
comes with three which is why the mesh one costs a little bit more and it's pretty bog standard in the back once again we don't have any back to front support just to save on those tooling costs but realistically at this kind of a price point you're probably not buying one of those extra fancy motherboards anyway also these are available right now maybe you do want to spend a bunch of your money though which is where their Flagship case the king 95 Mega Pro comes in and the party trick of this guy
right here is that these three fans can move out 30° that apparently can drop GPU temps by up to 5° C which is really impressive or if you don't want to do that you can just go right back there very easy this thing comes with a massive seven fans pre-installed so we have six inverted fans here blowing that way and up and in and one down at that back meaning you're going to have no trouble cooling even e8x boards which you can fit in here with an included bracket of course around the
back we have back to front support and this thing is $200 now that you have your case though you need to be able to cool your CPU I would highly recommend that and a good way to do that is using the hyperflow AR argb 360 this thing right here is 27 mm thick has a pump down in there and a $96 price tag which is pretty hecking good for a 360 mm radiator now this being you know you haven't had a montech AIO in your computer before so maybe you're a little bit concerned about the
reliability and they were concerned you would be concerned as well which is why it has a 6-year warranty with it and of course if this guy's a little bit too expensive you can spend $85 for the 240 mm version which is probably good for most CPUs and speaking of excellent warranties we have their Titan pla power supplies these guys right here are made by cic and come with a 10year warranty because cic's very good at making power supplies we love those guys and we really love that montech sponsored this
