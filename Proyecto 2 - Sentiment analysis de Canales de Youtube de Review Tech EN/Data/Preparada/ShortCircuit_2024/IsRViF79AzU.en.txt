transparent displays have been one of the biggest stories at CES this year which is cool but why well it turns out I had to leave the show floor and the strip entirely to find an actually good reason for a transparent display vo is a smaller company that has a pretty big idea about what these transparent displays can actually be used for and that's solving one of the biggest problems with video conferencing which is like you're never looking at the camera so they put a camera behind it and it looks like
well that's no good this is the vo Hol deck t55 a 55 in transparent display and as you can see right here there's a big old camera hiding behind it I guess it's not really hiding it is transparent but it's not just any webcam it's especially selected webcam by vo that helps overcome some of the problems that we're seeing on this display right here like these weird gross yucky lines Why are those lines there anyways well even if it's called a transparent TV there's some some things that just can't
be transparent such as your OLED pixel layer no matter what you're going to see the electronics that are going to actually emit light and along with this ghosting you can see these lines that's the camera actually picking up the pixels of the OLED display the reason there's doing this awful strobing kind of thing is due to the timing of the lighting that we have and the mismatch between the timing of the display it turns out there's a lot of hardware and software problems to solve to take an
image that looks like this and turn it into something that looks like this but why put the camera behind the display isn't that gonna like hurt image quality uh yes it's going to hurt it a little bit but the idea is that it's going to make video conferencing and communicating way more simple no more are you going to be looking up at the top for your webcam when you want to like really address somebody or looking at a host of people that are all kind of looking down at their screens aren't
making eye contact which is like you know remember how tiring that was in Co there there's a lot of people who are still doing tons of video conferencing and are still getting the same weird exhaustion from all of the strange communication errors that happen because of video now this is a 40% transparent display lets about 40% of the light through you can see there's a pretty clear difference between my hand being in the front and in the back and at this size 55 in it is just 1080p resolution
why well the amount of light you can get through the panel will go down with pixel density and that's a big problem for these cameras we've seen behind display cameras before from phones from like Oppo or even Samsung but the difference is that those had to sacrifice pixel density in a small area and the big task was trying to hide that camera unlike those phones there is no sacrifice to picture quality for your display on this monitor even on smaller models like their 30-in display this is
a very prototype version of it they have to maintain that same pixel density meaning that at 30 in you're only getting a 720p display which not that great it's not really ideal as say your main monitor but if you're somebody whose work involves a lot of teaching students or making a lot of video calls to clients or something this would be a great secondary monitor because you can get that extra level of connection and they do a lot of really cool things with it and we'll show you
that in a bit but for now let's talk a little bit more about some of the tech that they've had to introduce to get rid of all of that nastiness this is the enclosed version of that 30in display that we looked at over there but what it's missing is a software and Hardware level of processing for the video ignore these lines here uh this is part of a lot of the other features that they have jam-packed into this display like hand tracking but what I'm trying to get at as you can see is that since I put my
hand in front you can see that there's a ghost outline of my fingers right I go I point in and then suddenly there's this bigger ghosting around here that's due to inter internal Reflections from going through the layers of glass which is a problem but with enough clever software and Hardware trickery they can completely eliminate that and the final effect like we saw earlier is pretty cool let's go back to that demo after a word from our sponsor be quiet thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our 2024 CES
coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include power supplies case fans PC cases for said case fans all-in-one water coolers and high performance air coolers with fruits in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are hard to hear this year at CES they're showcasing new white PC cases white fans and even white hard drive cages step
into the world of quiet cooling with be quiet at the link down below now there's a lot more benefits than just an improvement to the comfort of video chatting there's actually some evidence that something called embodied learning where you are seeing a person in the frame doing stuff like you know moving text around or writing out their thoughts in front of you kind of like you're in a classroom brings improved engagement and learning outcomes for students or even just you know your
co-workers so a huge benefit of this is now that I can be in the middle of the frame and be teaching stuff to people obviously we don't need to do this via a transparent thing we don't need to do this but we using their conferencing software you're able to stare directly at people it makes you feel like you're present and it's going to improve the experience and even maybe improve learning outcomes for the people that are watching you which is pretty dang neat yeah we've dimmed the lights and
that's going to help this display but honestly it it looks pretty good for being you know seethrough um you can kind of see the camera structure a little bit in the middle especially when it's like there's nothing on the display that's something that we just don't see when you have the enclosed background because you're not going to have as much pass through from behind cuz well it's enclosed um but overall it's it's kind of kind of cool and another interesting thing is that it has a 120 HZ refresh
rate so technically you could game on it but obviously that's not really the target demo for this and you can kind of get a glimpse of what the target demo is by looking at the pricing this 55-in model is going to go for $8500 which is a lot but they're targeting businesses this is something that you're going to put in a conference room it's a tool that's going to help you make more money so that's why charging that kind of Premium it's not really the exact the consumer facing
device going to this smaller 30-in 720p display that's enclosed you're going to be seeing a price tag of 2500 and the "transparent version will be 3,000 they" also have a ton of other features that are going to be put into these monitors obviously we got these vanity lights you also have like things like hand tracking they're basically trying to make the ultimate all-in-one solution for communication and vo plans to ship in summer of 2024 and I think what they have right now is pretty dang cool
thanks to vo for letting us take a look at their display Tech and thank you for watching short circuit if you want to see more CES coverage Please Subscribe because that's where it's going to be right here on the channel
