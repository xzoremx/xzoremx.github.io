I wouldn't blame you for thinking does the world really need another handheld gaming PC at this point but the Zotac gaming Zone a prototype of which I'm holding right now has a pretty unique value proposition it's got a 7in screen runs at 1080p okay that's not that impressive but what is is that it runs at 120 HZ and is AMOLED with a peak brightness of 800 nits meaning that's right HDR Mobile gaming the only other system capable of at this time I believe is the steam deck
OLED right I believe so we think so and there's a lot more going on here for starters both the joysticks and the triggers are hall effect out of the box so there's no need to upgrade and each of them has a pretty cool party trick on the joystick you're going to find a little dial here which Zotac says can be reprogrammed to do I don't know I guess anything you like adjust your screen brightness adjust the sensitivity of the stick that's pretty sick and just like we've seen on high-end controllers like
the Xbox Elite series The triggers can be adjusted for either a long travel or a short travel depending on whether you need their analog functionality or you just want them to act as a button and while we're back here there's more to like we've got a couple of programmable rear buttons and look at that a little kickstand so cute is it adjustable though no luckily I can adjust to this segue to our sponsor thanks to private internet access for sponsoring our 2024 computex coverage their VPN network

good news is at least it's pretty ergonomic in the hands there's a nice swep shape to the bottom here and the spiky bit doesn't end up digging into your palm like it does on the first generation Ally and since we're looking at the front there's a lot more to like here we've got a total of 1 two three four five buttons on the front some of which I believe can be remapped in their software once it comes we've got two touchpads which are for folks who want to play uh realtime strategy games for
example and are considering something like an Ally and this is cool for the folks that are using these portable PCS as their daily driver machine and they need to I don't know conduct a zoom meeting or something like that it's got an integrated webcam that's flipping awesome you could like stream from this thing certainly has the horses for it did I mention it's using amd's 8840 U processor so you're going to have a total of eight CPU cores and a 780m GPU it's got 16 gigs of lpddr 5x memory a
512 gig SSD in the default configuration full length though so you could put in a much bigger one if you wanted to and has a 48.5 wat hour battery which means that it will be competitive with the Ally for battery life but probably not that competitive with the Ally x one thing that's really thoughtful though is the io up at the top we've got a fingerprint sensor enabled power button volume rocker headphone microphone combo Jack USB 4 Port love to see it and I love this another USB four port at the bottom
alongside a Micro SD slot this is great I love having one at the top and one at the bottom because when I'm lying in bed I don't want to be plugged into the bottom and when I'm sitting like this I don't want to be plugged into the top I don't want to have that drag love to have the option there are some question marks for me on a crowded show floor I'm not going to be able to evaluate how loud the cooling is or how good the speaker sound but overall this seems like a very compelling little package
wow that looks amazing oh okay definitely don't have the in-game settings tuned but man my friends look at the sky HDR is such a Difference Maker fli been awesome obviously I'm not going to be able to evaluate on the color accuracy of the screen in this environment and even things like the overall fit and finish and the clickiness of the d-pad although I do kind of like that click are not final this is still very much an engineering sample but it seems like they are well on their way to a pretty competitive
