dear insert name of Creator here after years of making blah blah blah mini saber Gen 2 funding the creation of real lightsabers come on you can't even write me a real letter James after we collabed two times in all seriousness though I am a daily driver yes literal daily user of the original hacksmith Mini saer which was a little blowtorch style lighter that was designed to look like whatever they could find to Rebrand off Valle Express but the Gen 2 is different this one they've done their own ID for that
is industrial design and I haven't actually seen it in person yet this looks pretty cool they've made some tweaks to the ignition mechanism which is still pazo electric but has been repositioned to help it fire more consistently they have improved the ergonomics I believe this is the dial for adjusting the flame height and they have vastly increased the fuel capacity I think they said by three times so it can run for a solid 15 minutes at Full Tilt they've also added the ability and
I have no idea how to do this yet but I'm sure we'll figure it out to put these little salt crystals in it to change the color of the flame oh wow that is a that is a lot of packaging for uh too many Sabers in a thing okay well anyway the point is I'm not actually mad thank you James and team for sending over this care package and I am super excited to try this thing out paint job leaves a fair bit to be desired look just because we're friends doesn't mean that I'm not going to critique the product this is
not the world's greatest paint job if it fixes my issues with the old one which mainly are down to inconsistency of ignition um inconsistency when you're running it upside down which I know is a real challenge with these style lighters and also limited fuel capacity then honestly I'll be pretty stoked oo color changing insert how many do you get in a pack oh wow you get you get a whack of them then you just hook that on there and it's grade 10 science class all over again you put the little
metal in the flame and then you get a color how much do these cost $15 15 bucks a pack okay how long does each one last one to 2 minutes good gravy cool party trick but uh maybe not the kind of thing that I would just keep buying every time I want every time I want to you know see a cool color or whatever I mean I don't know you compare it to like what fireworks cost I guess it's not that unbelievable should we go try it see if we can burn some stuff are we burning stuff is that the idea all right let's
do it I guess step one before I cook  up that's pretty leaky is it just full do does it fill really fast man James be watching this like dude minus what are you doing man okay well yeah it's got to be enough for now sure let's see need you guys ready safety glasses safety glass I'm using later yeah you can't be trusted safety  okay oh hey it is green okay we're going to have to go in the bathroom though cuz you're not going if we're in sunlight here come on come on come on come on come on check this out
woo okay legitimately kind of cool ah she throws some heat apparently these prongs up here can get quite hot and you should not touch them during extended periods of operation ow evidently that wasn't extended enough uh the bottom though is supposedly insulated so it won't get hot man these are these are kind of heavy eh woo all right let's go try and burn some stuff apparently the first thing we're going to do sponsored by dbrand is cooked popcorn what it's it's childproof yeah I can't here I can open it
well move your hands man oh ow ow ow I didn't move my hands safety oh yeah look at that cracked her open just like that any problem you can't solve with fire is a boring problem don't bother man I burnt myself already whoa whoa whoa health and safety oh yeah this I no I definitely do need these for this where' the oil go de bread didn't send oil they didn't send oil we we didn't get you can't you can't make popcorn without the oil this is not going to work yeah you need the oil
man I do have Jiffy Pop yeah let's go with Jiffy Pop this is not my fault I knew we needed oil don't don't blame me for our stupidity here what's the temperature the flame reaches "1400° it goes between, 1400° C or 2600" de F uh-oh I see oil leaking through the bottom oh yeah oh yeah that's hazardous for sure um but okay check out dbrand www.short lin.com they've got high quality skins they've got phone cases they' got skins for game controllers laptops phones all that good
stuff I don't think this is working it's not supposed to smell like that is it no I I don't think it's supposed to sound like that either I've never made Jiffy Pop before we supposed to take the to open gently lift the tab and pull along the dotted line are you supposed to have the paper top on while you cook it there we go okay that's better does it not will it not pop if you have the paper thing on top or what it wouldn't expand but it should pop yeah you'd think something would have popped by now you
know oh it's on fire is it I think so I saw some flames on this far side yeah oh yeah look at that it is on fire I mean I don't about you guys but I'm feeling pretty appetiz right now smells delicious well let's see how we did oh yeah we made our way through the bottom there so that might be part of the problem yo Belle yo you got another Jiffy Pop do we have another one no that we we bought one Jiffy Pop business team am I right all the oil leaked out yeah we do have other food oh we got other
food all right let's make some other food well surely we couldn't screw up roasting a maple flavor marshmallow wow that's the most July 1 thing I think I've ever seen yeah tremendous okay surely I couldn't screww this up oh yeah baby wow she really throws doesn't she you know what as far as hacksmith themed novelty lighters go this is my favorite one so far don't you dare buddy don't you dare damn it I have never tried a maple flavored marshmallow  yeah it's not better God I love
marshmallows like an actual child when it comes to marshmallows like an actual child when it comes to wiener too unfortunately pory Bon what I like she always has to buy me wieners yeah what dude I'm hungry you guys caught me before lunchtime you didn't think I was actually going to be making and eating food you got to make three you look at stand here yeah this thing's tiny who look at her go oh jeez okay yeah I I don't I'm not convinced that the flame adjustment dial does that much
appetizing uh yeah look at those grill marks oh yeah is that uh we're good I better not get a copyright strike for that ice cream truck I think it's dudl is what I don't oh yeah okay well which half do you want then I'm not that pole is going to be hot I can't eat off  yum it's warm it's thoroughly here get have the  one by the way the pack was $150 yes it was it's a very unpleasant temperature it's like body temperature you know mechanically separated chicken that's fine robot separated the chicken
next up we've got what happens if my grade six film Project had a slightly higher budget I will be dueling grou he doesn't get a lightsaber your robe sir oh thanks what is what is this this isn't a Sith robe this is some Halloween costume this is a Grim Reaper costume you can't fool me Execute Order  [Applause] a so at $85 is it the most affordable novelty lighter no is it fun yeah yeah I think so oh for those wondering by the way I will serious in the intro I I I do daily
drive one of the OG ones these daily for my bath I light my candles I don't normally fight um baby Jedi oh that's unfortunate but he's not done burning he's not dead yet he's going to I mean you saw what mole came back from and somehow grou returned thanks for watching subscribe to Short Circuit normally it's not like this I promise it's like Tech products
