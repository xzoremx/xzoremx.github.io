the idea of an arm- powered device that maximizes efficiency in battery life while offering adequate performance is a pretty good one and it's funny to me that on the laptop side of things everyone's kind of going that direction while on the handheld gaming side of things I'm looking at a device like the IOP pocket s asking in a world where the steam deck and its various competitors exist why do you need to I will say this right out of the box the form factor G justifies it a little bit I actually am
kind of loving the feel of this thing IO has apparently been working on this with Qualcomm for nearly a year and it features qualcomm's New g3x Gen 2 can I just say for a moment I hate their branding in a nutshell this is a gaming Centric so that seems to be most closely related to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with a similar octacore layout but a beefed up GPU that runs at a higher clock speed which in our testing we did observe has an impact on the heat of the device in its highest performance profile let's
just say it got a little toasty especially up in the top left where the S so is speakers a fully-fledged USB 3.2 Gen 2 Port ooh micro SD expansion hey so it turns out they can put these on phones see I thought it was impossible hey Gary what's the side switch do oh it's a turbo mode switch we got our bumpers our triggers which are hall effect as well as our tertiary buttons volume and of course our power of course the real action is happening on the face which has a better than a DS but not as
good as a full-size joystick like feel I actually really don't mind this layout the d-pad has been a source of consternation in the community the feel to it seems suitably adequate for me but IO has acknowledged the issues and are apparently issuing fixes oh this is a fixed one oh well that explains why it feels good then oo fully unleash the performance got it proceed we actually wouldn't necessarily recommend that we found that the best balance of battery life performance and user experience was in
balanced performance mode with the low fan mode and boy I can see why you guys adjusted the fan mode good gravy does  up jeez guys I want to take a quick look at the rest of the buttons but before I do that Gary's going to put the back of his body in the frame car come on this side look they didn't have video cameras  so Gary yes I can't figure out what half of these buttons do okay these don't seem to do anything yeah uh this is the most important one so that's cool ispace
is something that I do have experience with on their x86 handheld devices okay controller configuration this is a big bug bear for these Android devices is yeah sure there's so many emulators that are available for the platform now but sometimes getting controls bound to them can be a problem and it was great here right yes oh no it wasn't performance was actually quite good but U mapping the controls was a hit and miss Affair let me try it out and before I do that I'm going to tell

about but I will say that the cooling definitely seems to add some heft to this thing this is a dense device fun fact by the way hall effect does not mean quality it just means that it uses magnetic actuation like it uses magnetism to determine where exactly the stick is tilted the mechanical centering is still done by not magnets and if there's any inconsistency from one to the next then you could still need to have a lot of slop or big dead zones built into your product in order to make
sure that when it's centered your character isn't you know moving around or or or drifting seriously I can't bind the right stick to pan the oh my God man talk about fixing one problem and creating another one I got my cool onscreen controls and everything too bad I can't see anything what's going on see yeah just like yeah exactly like I've got about as much visibility as you guys do I think so you can see it's like it's trying to work what are you even doing buddy oh yeah look at
that oh I could make this work no no I got this I just need way more actions per minute one of the big highlights is of course the screen which uh now that I've turned it up all the way it's pretty darn bright we measured it at just over the 400 nits that it's rated for that right stick thing just stay in the middle are you kidding me right now settings theoretically I shouldn't have to do this anyway this game has controller support man which is a shame cuz this is the kind of thing I'd love to play on
the performance in our testing was pretty solid we got anywhere from 6 to 10 hours of battery life depending on the performance profile the screen was pretty good it's IPS so you're not going to get that amazing contrast that you'd get out of an OLED but it exceeded their specifications for brightness and had reasonable color volume I even quite like the ergonomics it's just that some of the oversights here I just don't understand how they made their way into a finished product this controller
binding issue like you can buy a backbone strap it to your Android phone and you're immediately having a better experience also the screen for all the good things that I said about it is only 60 HZ which means you're not even really taking advantage of the highest possible performance you can get out of this device because you're going to be 60fps locked the other big one for us is the price I mean if this was coming in and it was 250 50 bucks or something like that like it was a higher performance
version of something like a Logitech g-cloud and I could just use this to stream games all day and night off of Microsoft service or off of nvidia's game streaming service well all of a sudden at least it's got a reason for existing but starting at $59 I mean good Lord you're up against the entry level price for an x86 handheld and I mean they could run like any game you want does IO have justification for any of this other than please buy it oh there's a 1440p limited edition but then wait that's the only
one that we can seem to find for sale so in theory it actually starts at around $400 it's just that that's for the 1080p version that we can't seem to find for sale anywhere I it was a funny company every once in a while they absolutely nail it and then there's this the Ayn Odin on paper doesn't look as good but at the much lower price makes a lot of sense I don't know maybe we'll see some a future handheld from them since they're collaborating with qualcom anyway and we'll get something more like
a gaming handheld version of a Snapdragon X Elite or something like that and it'll it'll like really be awesome uh I just don't see putting my money into this one but I see putting my money into short circuit so subscribe so that I don't waste it hey
