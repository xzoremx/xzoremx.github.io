Health monitoring rings are kind of exploding in popularity which would explain how ringcon who sponsored this video managed to raise 4 million dollar on Kickstarter for this their second generation smart ring I've been using it for about 2 weeks so the fact that it's here in the box is kind of a lie but it's no fun to do an unboxing if it's not in the box so okay you get the so you get the ringcon Gen 2 which is packed full of sensors we'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute
but perhaps most importantly for now is that it is is thinner lighter and narrower than their last gen by about 25% about 33% and about 12% respectively so wearing it on the recommended finger which is the index finger though you can wear it on your middle or your ring finger if you prefer is I would describe as reasonably comfortable enough you can see obviously it's a little bulkier than just you know my basic wedding band here but it never bothered me in day-to-day use see I can close my fingers together
and have it not be pain which is kind of my Benchmark for that what else we got here some L documentation a USBC cable braided nice no wall wart though and their charging case which is actually kind of a big deal I really like this thing instead of having to do some fussy alignment it's clearly indicated how it goes on there's two little nubbin on the inside of the Ring which correspond to two little divots here and boom you're charging but you won't be doing that very often I was surprised to see that
their claims of about 10 days of battery life on this thing actually held true I got a nice little notification hey it's probably time for you to charge it popped it on the charger and the best part the charger has another about 150 days worth of battery on board so you only have to charge this case a couple times a year that's that's pretty convenient you know what else is convenient not having a subscription I know that's probably like a talking point for later after we've you know
talked about what the ring actually does but that's a pretty big deal for me I don't know about you guys but I have enough subscriptions in my life and I don't need one for the you know blood oxygen level monitor that I wear on my finger uh oh let's talk about all the other sensors in addition to blood oxygen monitoring ringcon is particularly focused on nailing down undiagnosed cases of sleep apnea and they say they were the first ring to do that and they do all of this while
staying ip68 waterproof I did not pay any special attention to this whatsoever over the last couple of weeks and it's alive so that's all I can really say about that oh wait no I can say more why don't we pull up the app and have a look at my health it's compatible with both IOS and Android and ringcon claims that their sleep apnea monitoring was found to be over 90% accurate which is pretty cool I did not turn on the Sleep apne monitoring but Belle who's been using it
for two 3 weeks as well says he did turn it on do you have sleep apnea bill I don't you don't hey congratulations we'll look at Belle's Health First no abnormalities detected well that's a strong statement but he apparently doesn't have sleep apnea probably let's poke around in my Health Data shall we day one October 17th hey good job 100% activity go Linus uh is that good stress okay all right hey look at that normal normal stress oh okay so I'm low stress while I sleep but before I sleep my
stress is improvable okay oh I see there's like a little there's a little Arch that shows your range yeah okay that's fair it's kind of cool that I can see the spikes for finding out about the power outage finding out about the setup issues and then giving my presentation no exercise records available time to start exercising dude I am way too lazy and disorganized to be like I am starting exercise now this is the type I am doing boop boop boop like no man they got AI or something they got
to figure that out now one area where the ringcon seems to disagree with one of my other smart devices is in sleep and I have no idea which is more accurate out of the eight sleep mattress topper or the ringcon Gen 2 but it's clear that there are some strong disagreements when we look at data from the same day they're both kind of on the same page in terms of like when I got into bed and when I got up but the actual sleep stages are way off here's an example on this day my mattress says
I had a lowquality fair night sleep while my ring says my Sleep Quality was good now ringcon allows you to subjectively rate your sleep and they're going to use that in order to give you a better evaluation over time but it's clear that just based on the raw data there can be disagreements between different smart devices about how exactly things were going so in summary I'd say the main pitch here is sleep and health monitoring without a subscription for people who don't want to wear a
watch and or don't want to micromanage making sure that their watch is charged and on them whenever they're sleeping the 10-day battery life was a GameChanger for me in terms of compliance because a device like this is only as useful as your willingness to be wearing it all the time and that's something that I think that ringcon has done very well if you guys enjoyed this video thank you ringcon for sponsoring this look at the ringcon Gen 2 you guys can check it out at the link down in the
video description and make sure that while you're down there you get subscribed to Short Circuit
