all right so you're telling me the nothing phone 2A runs with the pixel 7A in terms of performance runs cool and  330 I mean yeah I get it there's some issues on paper it's using a mediatech chipset which in the past has basically meant Bunch it but this is looking like a very complete package this time around oh I like that it's not super heavy dude I was looking for a phone to take with me on my trip cuz I need one for my kids to borrow for the plane I picked up one of
the most recent iPhones it been a little while I was like damn these things are heavy packaging wise you get a whole lot of not much it's not nothing but it isn't much you've got a Sim removal tool apparently the cable is supposed to go here but ours didn't have one in the Box maybe that's because it's an early unit and you get a phone there is a lot to like here obviously nothing's design language is back in partial Force you're not going to get any of the f lights on the back but
personally I love the transparent back and I also love that this is one of the first bones I've seen in a little while that doesn't have a gigantic camera bump on it we've got two 50 megapixel cameras back here one regular one Ultra wide both with Samsung sensors and that's not the only thing that they've done to help shave down costs I already mentioned they've gone with a mediatech chipset so it's the dimensity 7200 but while mediatech doesn't have the same kind of brand recognition that Qualcomm might
have this is not exactly your grandpa's mediatech chipset it's using the latest tsmc 4 nomer process it's got eight cores paired with eight or 12 gigs of RAM with their RAM Booster feature that essentially allows apps to run over from memory into storage and practice uh we found that in a phone configured like this with a decent amount of memory didn't make a measurable difference in anything that we were looking at but hey maybe it's a cool idea for Apple you going to take that Andy Apple doesn't
put enough RAM in their devices he has no defense even even the Apple Fanboys can't defend it there are more compromises you won't find a coil here for wireless charging because there isn't any and the USBC port on the bottom is only USB 2 just like the nonpr versions of the latest iPhones but it supports 45 W wire charging and has a "5,000 milliamp battery in it that in our" testing performed admirably we ended up with about 14 hours our longevity test which is playing back YouTube videos at
250 nits and a full charge was only 63 minutes pretty nice considering what value phones used to be like and the same can be said of the display yeah the pixel 7A outperforms it hitting higher peak brightnesses in small windows so you're going to get a better HDR experience out of that phone but the nothing phone 2A managed to hit about "1,000 nits Peak brightness full screen" in SDR so you'll be able to use it under any condition I realize I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit here though
I haven't talked about the design pretty much at all we've got the lock button on the right volume rocker on the left I already showed you guys where the Sim location is it's right next to that USBC port and that's about it noise cancelling microphone here and ah yes the glyph lighting interface does make a return but in a much simplified form so here let's go ahead and uh oh gestures are enabled by default so no bottom buttons although you can reactivate them if you really want to and then let's uh
let's see glyph lights on hey there we go and that's just a brightness slider okay what the hello now it's on okay what just happened this like this must be like watching my grandparents use a computer okay now they're on they're what they're gone now no they okay there you go there that's cool you got to get them full points for style you know this is one of those devices you look at and go man why would I pay a huge premium for design when this exists it is so cool and sure I
might not be the Arbiter of what is cool and what isn't but do you really disagree it looks freaking awesome I got to say as someone who doesn't really care that much about the skin on my phone yeah this makes less of a difference to me than it might to some people but I can't deny that it looks really good I also can't deny this message from our sponsor t t aims to be a super reliable mobile provider with prices that won't break your bank account with T's Unlimited Plan you get a host of features like free
international calls to 60 plus countries free hotspot and tethering and unlimited 2G data after you've used up your 35 GB of 4G LTE 5G all for just $25 a month and with t there's no bulk buying no advance or annual payment and no binding contracts so check them out below get it below tellow and say toow to your new personalized plan as cool as it looks I'm more interested in how it slides though it's not ltpo OLED okay so you're not going to get those on Hertz variable refresh rate values and you're
not going to get that super high peak brightness but you are still going to get Inky blacks it still manages variable refresh rate down to 30 HZ so you will get some power savings there and as we saw already it gets in my opinion bright enough especially when you consider the price some might complain about the 1080 X 2412 resolution but in my opinion even at this size it's not a problem unless you are extremely Keen eyed the first thing that I tend to do with the device is
turn the text size all the way down because I'm all about information density so let's do that and have a look I mean come on I get you want to show off how well you can see but even if I had a screen that ran at a higher resolution natively I would probably still turn it down to 1080 just for the power savings and increase in battery life it's got corn and Gorilla Glass 5 it's flat so if you're one of those people who doesn't like curved glass then you can suck on my Note 9 and you
can buy this phone personally I like the curved glass but I also get it the bezels are pretty reasonable again for a more value oriented device a big question mark for me though is the camera first of all can I double tap for camera yes I can thank you ooh interesting M it struggles a little more than some of the more premium phones compensating for the exposure issues that shooting into this light generally has that's in case you guys are wondering why I'm always taking pictures
in such suboptimal conditions on set what I'm looking for is how much this light source blows out the rest of the image and you can see the answer for this phone is a lot I would expect based on what I've seen so far that under better conditions it will Fair quite a bit better and the answer is it does that processing is pretty slow that's one of the things that Qualcomm has done a really good job of over the last five years is building neural processing and image processing capabilities into their
chipsets that are just better than what you're going to get on a budget chipset with that said this is not behaving like a budget chipset either with respect to this sure the processing times are taking a while but damn that is like really good here just for context okay okay just for context I know it's an older Flagship but this is what passed for a flagship phone like 5 years ago come on buddy you can do it look the phone app will open eventually oo I take back all the nice
things I just said it just got crushed by a note 9 now there's things people will like more about the nothing image it's poppier but like that is not what that looks like okay it's in Shadow that's what it looks like this light the note 9 blows it out you can see it's clipped but the nothing phone just has no idea what's going on here like this looks like two lights side by side when it is not that's a white wall with a little bit of spill on it just like we're looking at here ironically the ultra
wide handles that light source a lot better F shutter bud this might not be the thing for you but it'll definitely do in a pinch selfie camera though 30 2 megapixels and you know what again maybe I'm getting Bamboozled here but all of this is very usable like very usable let's say for example instead of a blank space you had friends you could put them there not bad and to their credit they're not overdoing the processing on the selfie camera I see this so much even from Big Brands where
they have all these effects and everything turned on it's like no that's what a tech bro who's pushing 40 looks like For Better or For Worse feel like I've aged 10 years in the last decade for video she'll do 4K 30 FPS and the lab reported that the audio recording quality was actually surprisingly decent so that's a pleasant surprise what's up y'all not bad at all really not bad I mean it's no iPhone but it also C like the freak said the iPhone start at these days okay technically the iPhone SE
still exists for $429 but get real so 13 starts at 600 bucks us 13 starts at $600 us yeah I would take this over that in a heartbeat it's got an aluminum frame it's IP 54 rated which admittedly is not really par for the course anymore it's as good as the nothing phone 2 but I would like to see that up to an IP67 rating and I guess now's the time for us to explore nothing OS a little bit we ended up using this instead of the stock Android experience for testing because
well they liked it it's more than just a theme on your desktop there's kind of similar to uh Carl pay's previous employer OnePlus thoughtful customizations to the stockish Android experience and we didn't find that it had a noticeable impact on performance or battery life which is all we can really ask right there right there back button on the right side is that so much to ask see thank you nothing thanks for nothing OS and to everyone who can't be bothered to do that thanks for nothing I just I like
the back button on the right okay we've got to do a quick audio test does it have an amplified earpiece speaker oh I guess we're about to find out I wouldn't expect it at this price I'll be impressed if it has it it does not bad stereo Imaging either and that's something that has really improved in the last 2 3 years my goodness has it gotten a lot better across the IND and not just phones laptops too just we have these tiny little devices with these tiny little speakers sounding like 
you a little muddy not the loudest thing  heard very reasonable considering the price you know I didn't really think about it until I was sitting here using the phone some more but the glyph interface is kind of perfect for me I have this problem and you'll have seen it actually here the editor will have seen it thr roll the clip of me getting interrupted by my phone notification the  2A look I'm very popular okay I forget what I have my phone set to very very often and so I'll end up with it on when
I'm supposed to be filming and then I'll end up leaving it muted when I'm supposed to be accessible to my family or my colleagues and so if I could just use their flip to gliph see the phone flashing out of the corner of my eye while I'm filming but put it in my pocket and have the notifications go that that would be kind of awesome some of the functions of the glyph interface are less applicable to me you can use it as a countdown timer for example why do you need to spend more than 350 bucks on
a phone oh speaking of $350 it's unfortunately not available in the US outside of their developer program where it cost $350 so it's not available but it is and the pricing is perfectly reasonable so what does that even mean I'm not even going to speculate why that is but it's $350 for a developer membership and you get a phone sure whatever that means this is cool they apparently have NTFS optimizations for moving files to and from Android and Windows that matters to me a lot I'm one
of those dinosaurs that still offloads my photos from my phone with a cable and man is it ever slow bring it home the  composer if the idea is to be annoying  attention wow boy would that ever be a itive uh uh Delete never exist again thank you there's a few more Labs notes on the phone it's Wi-Fi 6 but speeds were sorry as expected for a device of this caliber it uses Bluetooth 5.3 only but at least Bluetooth connectivity was extremely stable and so was the performance of the Inc screen
fingerprint sensor with it registering 28 out of 30 times across what is a mostly anecdotal test they were also very pleased with call Quality which is something that you know it should be good for cuz it's a phone now that leaves the last big question and that is how long exactly will you be using this phone for nothing is promising 3 years of updates with four years of security updates which is not on par with some of the really big players in the space anymore but at this price I consider to
be extremely reasonable better than nothing you might say no exactly the  look if they don't want people making these jokes then they should call their company something not stupid something  memeable subscribe to Short Circuit see you later
