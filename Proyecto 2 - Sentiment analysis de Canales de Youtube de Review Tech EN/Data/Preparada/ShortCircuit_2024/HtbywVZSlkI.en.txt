whoever said that EV is needed to be econscious What If instead you embraced electricity just to get more more torque more weight more capabilities and more children that you can't see right here this right here is the Hummer EV and holy frig I was thinking that we would just hate on this but I I kind of love it it's it's pretty great the first thing you will notice about the Hummer EV is that it is freaking massive this thing is 5 1/2 M long 2.2 M wide and just everything about it the scale is
insane the first time that I drove it like you you know it's going to be large just look at it but it's something else when you pass an F250 and you see its roof it recalibrates your idea of what is large I'm going into the frunk you can see that we have plenty of space in here for your groceries LT bag doesn't even start to fill it but what we also have in here are some little bags look at these these bags are here because this isn't just a pickup truck but it is also a convertible now unlike the Mazda
Miata which took us what like 3 and 1/2 seconds to get the soft top down this one takes a little bit longer I guess technically it is a target top but you can come in here undo these two handles give it a little pushing look at that we now have a roof panel which is a bit of plastic and it is off now you take your roof panel put it into the bag like so give it a little zip up and then do that three more times but you're not done yet now you can go into your glove box or maybe a
little spot in the trunk and get out your ratchet which you can use to undo these four bolts right here which allows us to remove this piece right here right here right  right and there is nothing over top of you Belle says it's not worth the effort he's wrong this is sick like that looks so bad now where exactly this goes uh I don't really know I watched a tutorial and they had a little spot down underneath the seats right here but we don't have the like molded plastic piece
where this and those nuts went so uh there there there you go with that incredibly simple roof removal process done we can look at the rest of the car first thing we have these little lights right here they were quite an expensive option and they do not give off a whole lot of light you have to go into offer menu aux auxiliary one to turn these on it took me a long time to figure that one out down below we have 305 tires wrapping 18in rims they are freaking massive and very loud coming back here
it'll take a while we can see the charger this thing right here is on an 800 volt architecture and it is freaking massive look from here to here is all battery and that's because this is I believe the largest battery in an electric vehicle on the market it is 248 kwatt hours 212 of which you can actually use that results in 63 km of range now that said it takes a long long time to charge this thing it does 350 Kow charging but when you have that many kilowatt hours of battery man
I had this plugged in for 8 hours yesterday on level two it did not go all the way up to fully charged from 72% it's insane moving around to the back you can see that we have a 5ot bed here but that is not all the bed comes down then right here we have another bit and another bit and part of the Omega package which is part of the "$41,000 worth of options on this we get" a Bluetooth speaker this thing is from kicker it is 100 wats it sounds kind of  bad but it is loud wow what a hun chunk
back here we also have 120 volt a AC and some mounting spots if you want to have a spare tire because it does not go underneath this for some reason another thing that's part of our Omega package is this absolutely incredible Neptune blue matte finish on here as well as like black Hummer logos and stuff it does look sick and apparently it is very difficult to care for now of course I know what you have been thinking this entire time it's so close to the ground I could really use an extra 6 in by
putting in extract mode you can go from 10.1 in of ground clearance all the way up to 16 this does completely ruin the ride quality and also you're not allowed to go more than 20 km per hour when you're in this mode but that is a lot of ground clearance it also has locking front and rear differentials and it's not DLC hopping into the rear seat we have loads of storage back here we've got our cuple holders storage there some storage right here bunch of space underneath the
seats as well as a subwoofer right here and of course functionally infinite Headroom sitting back here it is really quite comfortable I have loads of space in every single Direction unsurprisingly and it's also quite nicely equipped we have our rear climate usba USBC 120 volt back here another little storage space and overall it's is pretty comfy hopping into the driver's seat this is an excellent spot to be the whole theme of this is just so well executed and it doesn't hamper the
usability either we have just a whole bunch of physical controls that do stuff like your diff locks to your climate controls to your seat controls it is all very well done and also the infotainment is shockingly well put together you can go back to the main menu and it'll still have your song over here or your navigation if you're doing that it's all pretty fast and they worked with epic games to come up with these hilarious animations anytime that you do stuff like look at this bam truck comes out
there we have a whole bunch of drones hell yeah truck going over the terrain it is also completely extra in a way that I adore you really do have to stop thinking of this as like a vehicle and think of it more as like an exotic car this is much closer to like a Ferrari than a model y because everything is just so stupid I love it on our mode button here you can also select your driving mode on the right raise or lower the ride height by pressing up and down and select what kind of rear wheel steer
you want by pressing this button you can either turn it on off or if you hold it you can get into crab walk mode well crabwalk mode allows is for the front and rear wheels to turn in the same direction which allows us to go sideways into the segue to our sponsor manscaped thanks to manscape for sponsoring this video as a famous member used to say I love gold and so does manscaped and that's why their lawnmower 5.0 Ultra now comes in a luxurious new limited edition color forged gold it has
all the great features of the regular models such as interchangeable trimmer and foil Blaze and a LED to shine through all of the Shrubbery just this time in Gold so get Royal all up in your business with the forge gold lawnmower 5.0 Ultra at manscape.com shortcircuit and use code circuit for 20% off and free shipping all right we are now crab walking and it is one of the weirdest feelings ever we are currently going straight but we are what like 10° pointed that way it is hilarious it is
one of the oddest feelings ever now it isn't exactly practical I did have a little bit of a trip in the ionic 5 at CES that had proper actual crab walking that allowed you to do things like Park in little spots I tried to use crab walking to parallel park downtown and it went horribly people were just looking being like what is this guy doing and now in terrain mode the rear steer is so aggressive up to 10° that it feels feels like you are just drifting around a parking lot it is
hilarious the best thing about it is that this is actually an incredibly Nimble little car well an incredibly Nimble fing massive car has a turning radius of 11.3 M which is really quite good for comparison the ionic 5n had a 12 1/2 M turning radius and despite this vehicle being so freaking huge it is notice easier to park especially when combined with this excellent 360 camera it is shockingly easy to put in a parking spot even though it is massive speaking of the cameras this is the most
complete camera in that I've ever seen in a car there are 18 of them and you don't just have the full 360 but you also have underneath it like look at that you can see both of your wheels here front and back so if there's a really difficult obstacle that you can go over you can make sure that you don't bang your de off a rock by just simply looking at it right here enough screwing around in the parking lot though we need to give this thing a launch what you do is you double tap traction control off
which brings up here watts to Freedom or WTF mode this right here lowers the vehicle and then when it is ready you get to launch it with my freedom armed I I can do my foot all the way on the  "holy this thing despite being over 9,000" lb has a 0 to 60 of 3.3 seconds that is accomplished with "1,000 horsepower and 12200 ftlb of" torque and oh my God this thing should not move like it does we can just be going here sorry Andrew it is manical now if you watch as we go I really need to turn to the left
because when you floor it in this it actively tries to put you into the ditch it is hilarious and unlike the acceleration in any other EV in most of them it's like you're getting pushed back into the seat but this thing squats so far back that it's much more like you getting cued by the seats as it just flies back and the people on the ISS are like G as your high beams blind them man this is the first time that I've driven with the top off this is sick sadly though we're going to have to
put it back on because all terrain tires  loud now that we have usable audio we can talk about cornering which um it might surprise you guys but throwing 9200 lb of machine into a corner does not result in the best handling ever this is the very first time that our F-150 camera car was difficult to keep up with in one of our cars it is so much body roll also when you're driving around town or at like medium speed roads like we're going 75 right now it's pretty okay but once you hop onto the
highway and get going 110 120 it becomes kind of concerning pretty quick it turns out that it's not very relaxing on the highway if you have cars on either side when your vehicle takes off an entire Lane now what does help in that situation is the fact that this does have GM super cruise I maintain that that is the absolute best driver assistant because it's actually mapped the roads and it actually is trustworthy unlike many others where you're kind of like I think it's doing the right thing
but overall on the highway bad time especially when you combine that with just how loud these allterrain tires are it is not a super luxurious experience speaking of which there are some luxuries that you would expect for the price of this car that you don't quite get the one that I want the most is massage seats which does feel kind of strange to ask for but at the same time it's expensive it is expensive one thing that is very fortunate though is that if you want to drown out that tire noise
you very easily can with the excellent sound system in here play crab Rave in here we have the 14 speaker Bose sound system and it is pretty darn good it has extension down to 30 htz and it is a little bit on the warm side there's a bit of a dip from 600 HZ to 10K but that said it sounds really good in the driver mode you get very good staging you have the vocals right there in the center and overall it just bumped so overall then the Hummer EV I think this thing is exceptional it is so ridiculous it just
makes me giggle nothing gives you more than this nothing weighs more is faster and do you know what also is more the price this one that we have here with its "$41,000 of optional accessories comes in" at "$21,000 " Canadian that's a lot of money have are you aware how much money that is that is a lot of money but like what else are you going to buy a cyber truck and have your payload just fall off with the hitch no "this right here will actually tow 1,200" lb in the 2X or this one with all of the
options and stuff only gets 7500 but that still is quite a bit and I at least trust it if I am honest I came into this expecting to just dunk on this thinking it was incredibly stupid and it is it is the stupidest vehicle I have ever been in but that was very clearly the goal from the beginning and GMC has executed it perfectly this thing is absolutely hilarious and I love it just like I love you hugee thanks for watching hit like get subscribed and have a great old day do you want to say
anything Belle I love you too
