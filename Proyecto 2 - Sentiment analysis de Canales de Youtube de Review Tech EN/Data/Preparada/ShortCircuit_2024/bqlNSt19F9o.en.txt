iano has been making some very cool but very expensive handhelds over the last few years and now we've got the Quinn which they're touting is a high-end top tier mobile gaming device and holy crap I am not talking price yet but it comes in a wooden box look at how beautiful this is look you get this like text this ISS iono Quinn it's got an Obi strip that we're going to try to get off here oh man this is beautiful this is probably one of the nicest un boxing experiences I've ever had this just
slides out and you can I mean no one's going to do this but you know you could put it in your home somewhere and then oh this is actually just like a little background of mountains okay you know what don't put the acrylic up somewhere but this is like a nice little Scenic Mountain Range kind of deal oh my God there's more um okay I haven't even looked at the console yet because instead we've got  what wandering boundless and free oh wow  long oh and then on the back is a bunch
of like instructions or something say what you will about the rest of the console uh this packaging is incredible we've just got a little uh diagram here for like where our home button is okay well that's that I thought this was like a second booklet but it's really just a piece of foam for our console but then there's another little paper sheet here what's in this we got our ipace 2.0 instruction manual that's just the software that they used in the handheld custom software uh and then we' got
three other little boxes here this is probably the charging brick if I had to guess real Gamers no Gamers ya is a real gamer Gan 100 wat fast charger okay that's actually pretty sick um that's a bit more than your standard 65 watt Gan charger that other handholds are coming with and we got two other boxes what's in this cables uh wall adapters Okay so you're set wherever you go thanks ya this has got to be the cable if this thing comes with a charger but no cable I would be incredibly disappointed and
yes it is in fact a ctoc cable that's a decently long charge cable too it's nothing uh too much like you're going to have a little trouble if you want to sit on one end of the couch instead of the other but whatever that's fine it also comes with two handy dandy USB C to a cable adapters and now for the console this thing is huge it's got an 8.4 in screen it's 2560 x600 so you're getting a 16x 10 aspect ratio and uh it is heavy how much do you weigh 945 G they advertise 950 on their
manufacturer's website give or take a few uh that's fine for reference the steam deck is what 650 roughly the Alli is like 608 um so this is Hefty and I don't know it honestly feels pretty comfortable in my hands as is but I don't know if I would feel comfortable holding it like on the bus for an extended gaming session it's got an 8o d-pad which I don't think feels amazing but I don't honestly hate it either a couple of thumb sticks and back triggers these all four are hall effect which is
great means it'll be a little bit more reliable and you're not going to deal with stick drift as quickly looks like they've got touchpads here or something I'm not sure we'll have to investigate once we turn it on that's a big complaint uh from a lot of people is they like the steamex touchpads but you don't have it on the allly triggers feel a little light they're not the worst but uh the bumpers aren't super satisfying I'm a big fan of like Xbox 360 Arrow bumpers that are like clicks these are a
little mushy not too bad though yeah it's got four buttons on the back as well I'll be frank I never use these I know that a lot of people might but for me personally it's really not an issue if they don't have the four buttons on the back I never bought a Pro Controller or anything like that actually what's this little open whoa comes with a kickstand oh there's a Micro SD card slot there nice okay this is great so while it might be really heavy it does come with a kickstand kind of like the
legion go or the switch OLED so if you do want to like grab a controller hook it up through Bluetooth or even wired cuz it's got looks like yeah both top and bottom USBC ports which is another huge plus um you can just game like this no problem on an airplane or at home if you know you just want to game in the living room from your couch uh that's really cool actually really happy to see that close it for now face buttons feel yeah perfectly fine they're a little small but not too small um I
don't know what this t button is and uh the three dots that t might be for is BAS turbo maybe uh then we've got a little volume rocker on the top power switch usba a that's actually really surprising to see a usba a port on this thing one of the really cool things about these USB BC ports is that they're USB 4 and even if they're only gen 1 they're going to be running at at least 40 GB per second so you've got a lot of bandwidth to play with here I also just really like this like silver shiny
exterior that it's got on the plastic I don't know it feels retro who does a light silver like this anymore uh I kind of dig it though it doesn't look like there's a ton of visible screws I know that previous iOS weren't that hard to take apart uh we've got two on the bottom here and then I'm guessing you take off this little rocker bar which is also a couple of switches I pull that off more screws take it all apart shouldn't be too hard previous ones weren't too bad one thing that probably
contributes to how heavy this is that I forgot to mention earlier is it's got a 75w hour battery which is enormous the legion go has a 50 W hour and then the steam deck and the Ally are both "something around 40 That's 19,500 Milli" hours it is a lot of juice this thing is packing a 7840 U from AMD which is is similar to what the Ally has and what a legion go is equipped with the difference here that IO has managed is that it can turbo up to 54 Watts TDP which is significantly higher than both
of those other handhelds so I'm really curious to see I mean it's going to drain the battery way faster but I want to see just like how much performance you can really eek out of this 7840 U so let's turn it on and give it a try but not before a word from our sponsor thanks to pulseway for sponsoring this video when it comes to managing your it systems it shouldn't be a headache our sponsor pulseway wants to make performing important actions on your system simpler while having complete
visibility into the network from anywhere pulseway lets you monitor manage and troubleshoot your workstation from the comfort of your phone compatible with any operating system take complete charge of your servers patched and it systems with pulse way try it free today with a no commitment trial available at the link below wa I Neo it's got little specs it's an IPS screen so it's okay it's not OLED like the steam deck OLED but but uh hits like 500 nits supposedly it actually gets
brighter than advertised measuring around 600 nits want to check what the refresh rate and everything is so I'm going to go into ipace uh that's cool they've got their performance modes but I don't like how it's like AAA game normal a game Retro Game I guess that's easy for some people uh unlimited FPS you can cap your FPS which is a great feature it's also got a little battery estimate here uh 2 hours 25 minutes but I think that says at 18 Watts so it's a little hard to trust that upon further
review ipace has an option in the main program that has a for CPU turbo but it's disabled by default despite the 54 WTS being a really big selling point brightness is cranked airplane mode off always off and then the T for the t button the t button is for the touchpad and it brings up a bunch of touchpad controls like gestures click control cuz yeah you can you can click on them too like buttons um oh okay so that's acting as like a most cursor left click or right click cool display settings
perfect display settings what are you running at what's your refresh rate 60 HZ oh okay I'll admit I'm a little spoiled I know that the 120 HZ refresh rate on the Ally and the legion aren't like huge features for some people even the steam deck OLED is 90 HZ now 75 even really helps with that not input delay but I don't know just like hitchy kind of mouse look and I don't like it and uh it's a really minor complaint but IO you pack this is supposed to be a high-end top tier system with like a really good
IPS screen and you couldn't do more than 60 HZ I'm a little disappointed it is a touch screen it's a really good feature for when games are broken and you need to like go to Windows home screen to try to do whatever you need to do to force close the game um you can just swipe up and boom it all tabs out for you essentially I've been playing a lot of Pacific Drive I just want to see how it handles Pacific Drive they claim it gets up to 500 nits and frankly it kind of seems like this thing gets really bright
that's another really easy way to save on battery life as well if you don't have a handheld yet like you can just turn this all the way down and it's  light did you hear  loud 54 Watts baby let's go one thing I'm looking for is I can't remember if ipace has a built-in frame rate counter doesn't look like it it is claiming to pull 50 Watts which is wild CPU G U 71c and 64c if you believe their reader uh 5400 RPM is what that fan is spinning at and I believe it you know this is why
you've got headphones you just drown out that fan it's got Bluetooth 5.2 as well if you don't have any old Ox cable headphones anymore this is chopped I let me let me change some let me change some in-game settings here one thing I'll note is I just went to pause the game and it felt very uncomfortable moving my thumb all the way down here to do so uh almost all the other devices have their paw and and uh options buttons like right here near the top like why is the touchpad button that I'm going to
use once every I don't know month or whatever way up here it should be maybe down here or down here um I think they've just got too many buttons here's your hamburger and like typical options button that you see in most consoles now this d-pad feels bad now that I'm using it to like actually use menus and stuff just feels I don't want an 8po touch d-pad built like this I just want like four clear buttons then you can press two at the same time uh that would be very preferable it's not getting stuck
or anything um but it feels a little sticky and I definitely don't like the d-pad I'll admit I haven't played this on my Ally yet it is a bit more demanding even though it's just kind of an indie game uh it's got a lot of effects so it looks really pretty um this is playable this is probably like 30 maybe 40 FPS with some hitching every now and then part of the problem with Windows handhelds versus the steam Deck with Steam OS is that you kind of run into problems like this where it's like
no I I tried to tell you to do full screen and then it's like okay but I don't want to do full screen cuz you're telling me to do 1280 x 720 so it's like okay cool let me change the windows resolution to 1280 x 720 then relaunch the game then let it work doesn't happen in every title A lot of them just work seamlessly okay that's a lot better we changed Windows to 1280 by 800 uh and then we changed the game resolution to this to match that and then we turned everything to low and while this fan is
still cranked like it is cruising um the game performance is markedly improved and it's much more playable now yo this looks great turn my headlights on I mean don't get me wrong the game looks a lot worse when everything's set to low but in terms of just playability totally playable let's try the speakers out let's you know let's turn the volume up yeah this is totally fine it's hard though because like the speakers who I hit like a single object and the performance just
tanked that's not bad let's let's try crab Rave and like see how it is especially when the game is not running and so the fans aren't like just blasting YouTube I got to say one of the really nice things about having this big 8.4 in screen is that using it at a as a Windows device feels okay um like watching YouTube videos and everything it feels like actually usable and full screen look at that that's beautiful    50% so they're bottom firing speakers coming out of these slots right here
even though you kind of cover them up when you put them on the kickstand it doesn't really kill the volume which is really nice I'd say they're adequate maybe a little worse than a full fat laptop but you know they're not bad it is wild that it lets you just turbo to 54 Watts without it plugged in uh the Ally you need to be plugged in to do 35 grab the controller and kick back my brother in Christ I am holding what is a controller and a computer at the same time whoa this is actually really
playable I'm pretty sure I'm still at "like uh, 1600p"  fans returnal at 800p we're getting 42 average FPS and 30 at the 1% lows when we're using 54 Watts if we turn that down to 30 Watts it hardly changes anything going to 40 and 28 compared to our Legion go though uh we're getting 37 average so even at 30 Watts it's beating it what's surprising is that in some other games like rocket League it doesn't always maintain that edge for instance we're seeing a slightly higher frame rate on the legion go despite
using more juice on the iono Quinn using the same processor so take that for what you will but overall performance is you know fine in the games that we tested in our endurance testing setting this and the legion go to 200 nits it actually didn't do all that much better in YouTube endurance testing we got 7 hours out of both systems our combuster stress test gets a big dnf when you set it to 54 Watts for whatever reason it simply fails to complete the test despite the CPU only reaching about 75° for our
Prime 95 stress test at Max brightness on 30 Watts we're getting an hour and 29 minutes compared to our Legion go which was hitting an hour 35 however we did notice that the CPU on the go was only drawing about 20 watts for most of the test so that does account for the major difference in battery life here one more thing that I failed to mention earlier is that the power button also has a fingerprint scanner if you like unlocking your device like that and if you prefer facial recognition it's got a
little camera right here as for the price that's where things get a little iffy uh if you want the 16 gigs of RAM with 512 gig SSD we are talking about "over ,00 us which is a lot uh a steam" deck is what like half of that the Ally is half of that the even the legion go is a similar price as the other two devices like man it's it's hard I would love to support a more Indie developer uh like IO but they're also I mean they've been putting these out for a while now so are they even Indie I don't
know it's it's hard to say that's that's rough and then if you want you can spend another $100 and get the doubled capacity version of this guy with 32 gigs of RAM and one terabyte SSD we're talking 100 bucks for literally doubling uh it's totally worth it I think at that point although to be frank I probably won't recommend this to any of my friends maybe if the 75w hour battery performed a little better than it did in our testing um cuz then you'd have a pretty good argument right that's that's
the real big issue with a lot of handhelds is like it doesn't last that long steam deck is probably the best um especially when you're running it in low wattage but like the reality is with a lot of these things you're not going to get more than a couple hours out of them maybe three if you really push it for the most part I prefer just keeping them plugged in and playing at the couch so for me the battery is not even an appeal I want the lightest system I can get 945
G that's almost a kilo it's really heavy honestly and that's on top of the fact that IO hasn't always had the best customer service in the past as well even with this launch uh they've had some issues getting all the units to their customers we had reports of the d-pad sticking and um I'm not so sure that I would uh trust someone like that with "$1,200 thanks so much for watching like" comment subscribe if you want to check out another one look at the io slide it's got a slide up screen with a
