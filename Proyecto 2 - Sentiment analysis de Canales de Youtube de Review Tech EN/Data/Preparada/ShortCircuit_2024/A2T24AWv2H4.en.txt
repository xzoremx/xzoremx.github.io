if you saw my f 6 unboxing you'll remember I went on a mini rant about camera bumps well red magic must have heard me because they decided to sponsor this short circuit with their new 9s Pro and it had oh well first of all oh my goodness it's got Anime that's going for that's going to my house oh look at that look at that flat back no camera bump at all this is a gaming Focus phone which makes sense cuz I guess if you're holding it sideways you don't really want your finger to kind of bump into
that camera bump but let's look at what else is in the box we have our type c to type c 3 and 1/2 ft long and oh yeah a wall wart all right well they're doing everything right they give me this and no camera bump I'm already on their side looks like we got some more accessories in here let's open this up oh a comic book oh it's a quick start guide it got me all excited with that comic book cover on art on the front oh this must be like a protective plastic back plate that goes
on just like that okay well oh my goodness you might want to give it a wipe down because I've held it for about 4 seconds and it is just covered in fingerprints oh well give it a good wipe exploring this side here we actually have this opening which is for the fan that is on the back that is not a camera bump because it actually takes air coming through this side and exhausts it out the front here that way you can you know get good gaming performance cuz it'll keep your phone nice and cool then you
have your volume button your power button and on the other side there's that exhaust for that fan and on the top we have a 3.5 mm audio jack which I shouldn't have to praise in 2024 which is awesome and then our SIM tray at the bottom there and then being a gaming phone when you're holding it on its side like this these two little buttons over here are capacitive kind of like triggers when you're holding it like a controller which pretty cool honestly maybe if you like Mario Kart drifting I
don't know wa red magic yo that's Mora oh let's go sorry I'm already in love I mean I have a wife I can't be in love to a phone I've never had a wife on a phone it's lit morea dress up okay I need to get out of here I'm going to spend too long in there but I keep going so all oh so that's not a notification slider that's the game space button oh she turns when I swipe focusing way too much on the anime girl so this uses the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and ours has 16 GB of DDR 5x memory and 512 GB of storage the
starting one actually starts at 12 GB of RAM and 256 gigs of storage and they actually have four different color options now including a new one called Frost which I think actually looks pretty good this is our Cyclone one but I think overall I actually kind of just like the style of the phone got a little bit of creative with it didn't just make it like a flat black surface or something like that it's a 6.8 in AMOLED screen at 120 HZ and they're claiming "1,600 nits of peak brightness our Labs"
on a 1% uh area only tested "1,245 but we can't actually go any" smaller than a 1% size so maybe when they did their test numbers they went even smaller than that but overall it still seems I'm on 50% brightness and like right now that is very bright to see my wife so I'm I'm fine with that and the touch sampling rate is actually at 960 HZ which again when you're gaming can really matter if you need to make really quick adjustments or fine adjustments or you're constantly moving
on the screen so let's test this screen though with some HDR content here this is nice I actually don't watch a ton of HDR content even on my HDR devices like my phone or other phones but honestly this looks really really pretty and I would be happy to watch any piece of content on this and one of their things that they you know like to boast about because it's a gaming phone is it's like a full screen there's no notches for a front camera at all from what I can tell is there even a front camera on this I
don't know if there is it's an unders screen oh it's like right at the top wow I really can't even see it that yeah that is genuinely one of the uh best looking kind of under screen cameras I've seen it's a 16 megapixel and the two rear cameras here are 50 megapixel all Samsung sensors and they look pretty good even when we take you know a good looking video of sherad here the zoom very smooth it goes all the way up to 10x Zoom which I think is more than enough a lot of phones boast like 50x or
100x but I don't know I what are you zooming in that much that you need to use your phone you can't walk over and go take a look at you know just turning it up sorry I'm completely off topic the vibration on this is amazing for even just like turning up the volume that's probably has to do with like the gaming and you'll be able to feel the rumbles we'll get to that when we actually game in a bit I think I hear crackling but if we turn it down like one notch I like those a lot actually but again if
you're not into speakers 3.5 mm Jack anyways you can plug any type of headphone that uses that so that's pretty sweet is the light too bright what the you scared me Captain don't do  uncomfortable don't I don't actually know what to say that kind of really caught me off guard that's nice at least I won't feel alone I can just tap my phone every so often it'll feel the warm voice of a woman all right let's go into gaming oh it's definitely blowing air out of there you guys can probably hear
it it's very quiet in this room you can barely hear it so it doesn't really bother me oh that's the the haptic triggers there on the top there you can see that it's turned to to Pink now and if we pick a different color blue doesn't feel too warm yet which is good it's just in the boot up screen while it's queuing for a game though they actually sell their red magic cooler 5 Pro here which is a little cooler that can attach to the back of your phone to help keep your temp you know more
Managed IT can just connect with a USBC cable which you could use the one from your phone or thankfully they give you another one here I don't think we actually ended up needing it cuz in our Labs testing when they were playing some of the games all of them just hit their cap at 60 FPS so we definitely weren't being thermal Limited in any way which is good but I guess if you want to go even colder this is ridiculous and I love it what's up gamer they let you do short circuit now huh apparently this is the
the sequel to your wife Fu phone oh yeah  attractive oh look at that smooth 60 FPS I actually have a little FPS counter on the left there and it is not dropping even a little bit let's go which is you know good our Labs also tested it got 60 FPS stable across the board in both Cod mobile and genshin if these triggers are a little awkward for you cuz you maybe don't like the haptic or this Cable's getting in the way they actually sell another accessory which is pretty sweet
it's called the red magic dual Shadow wa that's awesome it just clicks together like that the only feedback I would give is I think the last generation of this controller had a bar that ran across the back which would obviously conflict with their current cooler but that bar helped give it a little bit of stability if this is on the phone we noticed it was a little wobbly when we were holding it which might not give you the best of experiences but I think having a controller is pretty cool it's Bluetooth
paired this time but the being able to game like this with an actual controller I don't mind that at all either pretty nice the battery is the same size as the last phone as well it's "6,500 mli hour batteries at supports 80" W fast charging which is pretty awesome and in the longevity test for a battery doing a 1080p playback on YouTube we got almost 20 hours of battery which like I don't think I've ever personally experienced on a phone every phone I've had I just kill way too fast but 20
hours of battery just browsing Media or you know going on Tik Tok that's honestly pretty sweet just some other notes about the phone it's got NFC which is great it's got an unders screen fingerprint sensor which you know I personally prefer the physical button but at least it doesn't add on another button to my phone so maybe that's okay it's got Bluetooth 5.3 it also has an IR blaster which I I guess if you're into that that's pretty pretty cool I I don't know what I would personally use it for
but at least it's got it it has a lot packed into this phone and starting at $649 I think that's pretty great our config ended up coming out to about $799 which flagship phone price you know it's getting up there but I think you get a lot in this phone especially when it comes to the gaming and where it counts apparently they have game inspired wallpapers that you can just have no Mora as cool as these are I lose my bay this is no this is like on the home screen so like you can see my
Google C oh I'm going to hit up oh crap I opened my Google Calendar by accident that's actually kind of funny but uh bring me back Mora shro you have Bamboozled me I have lost my wife all no oh well I guess if you guys enjoyed this video you should go check out the last Red magic phone which lonus did he also had a waifu I don't think he appreciated it as much as I did though
