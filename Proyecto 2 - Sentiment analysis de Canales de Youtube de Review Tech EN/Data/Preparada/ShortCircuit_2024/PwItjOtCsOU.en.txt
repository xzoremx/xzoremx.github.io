we're here at CES 2024 in the hyperx arena check out hp's brand new laptop starting with the Spectre and also we have an omen transcend that looks like a fantastic gaming laptop this thing right here though man I don't know if you guys remember what the old Spectre looked like but it had diamond cut edges all the way along the side that were for one sharp I don't like sharp laptops and also they just look kind of I don't know it wasn't good it wasn't bad but it was certainly A vibe and this one right here
I really like the way that they've rounded it off it feels great to just hold like this but they have maintained that little Diamond edged corner right here so if we look at the I/O we have Thunderbolt 4 another Thunderbolt 4 that's at a 45Â° angle they say That's great so you can have you know your charger going off to the side instead of directly into your mouse then on the other side 3.5 mm headphone jack and USB type A it has all aluminum construction so it's a little bit on the heavier side
compared to a magnesium laptop that's 14in but at just over 3 lb is not too bad and the build quality is absolutely fantastic like if we give her a big old reef on it here you can see this table is a lot less stable than this laptop thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our CES 2024 coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include PC cases power supplies Water and Air Cooling and fans for desktop PCS
with roots in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are nearly inaudible this year at CES they're showcasing their new white PC cases white fans and even white hard drive cages step into the world of Silent Computing with be quiet at the link down below we had to move cuz they started playing copyrighted music there's a party starting but the real party is how  see it is awesome I would give it an Easy A it doesn't quite get the A+ that
the dragonfly has but you know when you're making one of the best laptops yeah not an A+ but a solid a which is better than most what we also have here is a new haptic touch pad so this right here is using little Force sensors and peos so that when you press on it instead of it actually clicking it's vibrating and giving you a little tactile bit now it doesn't feel quite like how I would want it but the one ful thing about htic touchpads look at this I can go right down in here change the
intensity and now there we go I like it about right there so that's what I love about these Force touch pads you can sort of adjust how much force it takes to actuate it and just tune it to how you like love it also what I love this display it is 2.8k 120 htz but it goes down to 48 in order to save you battery life and it just looks fantastic did I mention that it's OLED cuz you would not be mistaking that for something else look look at those black Sandy they say it has up to
400 nit Peak brightness which is not the brightest that we've seen but at the same time with that contrast of the OLED man does it ever look good also it's a little 14-in laptop with 120 HZ display I absolutely love that laptops even like the more professional ones are starting to get high refresh rate and also you can do that if you want I don't but you can now to get into the Spectre you can use either a fingerprint up on the power button right here best spot to have that or Windows hello facial
recognition up top and that is attached to an excellent webcam so this thing right here is 9 megapixels in a webcam all right how is this webcam wow this is a challenging environment bunch of direct lights but if I move around here wow that that that is sharp you can see that my hair is kind of being a bit strange normally you can't do that with a webcam and it is so good exposing forur my face look at Andy he's got this super bright light right here but we can also still see detail in
the black areas and it is always exposing for my face excellent job HP one of my favorite things to do at CES is to ask if I can take it apart everyone always says no and then you ask a couple more times and then you get to take it apart four T5 screws later here and we can get into this thing right here and see their cooling solution so we have two fans two heat pipes we have up to an Intel Ultra 7 155h and also we have up to 32 GB of RAM at 7467 megga transfers per second that
unfortunately is soldered right here but you also cannot get those kind of speeds with sodm here we have a removable Wi-Fi car that's up to WiFi 7 and a removable SSD so you can upgrade that in the future here we have our 68w battery which is absolutely massive look at how much of the laptop that is taking up and they say that it will get you up to 14 hours of battery life and even though a lot of laptop manufactures I'm like HP is generally pretty good but we will have to test in the lab to know for sure
if you want a larger battery though and a lot more power here is the new Spectre 16 this right here is essentially the same except well larger obviously we have an HDMI 2.1 on the side in addition to the rest of the io which remains unchanged and also we have an up to an RTX 4050 in this thing so I could see a lot of content creators being drawn towards this when maybe you're not so happy with what Dell's done with their most recent refreshes also here we have look at the size of this
trackpad it's absolutely massive now sadly I don't know how many watts the 4050 in this will be able to consume so I can't comment on just how powerful this will be but at the same time if you're looking at this you're probably not looking for the most powerful laptop you just want something that's nice to go around it's about 4 lb feels great trackpad again look at this trackpad and it also has all the other things that made the 14 fantastic if you do want performance though oh we have the omen
transcend 14 this is a whole new skew everyone these days has a 14-in gaming laptop and this right here in my opinion is one of the best one thing that's kind of strange about it is that around back we do all of the Power delivery over USBC so it comes with 140 W USBC charger and the rest of the I/O is pretty good around this side they have two USB type A's to make sure that the cord of your mouse goes just directly into it while you're gaming around back you USBC with
power delivery and display out although I could not confirm if this is wired up for Nvidia Optimus HDMI 2.1 Thunderbolt 4 and 3.5 mm headphone jack now as far as I can tell it's all plastic construction on this thing but the build quality is just absolutely fantastic I'm going to have to take this apart and see if it's magnesium just cuz how did they get something that's made out of plastic this stiff like look at that if I really refund it does bend a little bit but you
aren't going to be doing that dayto day for the display we get as far as I can tell the same panel that's on the Spectre 14 but without touch so this right here yeah can't be doing any of that but at the same time for a gaming laptop this thing is absolutely fantastic so 120 htz but it's variable so down to 48 and it has full coverage of DCI P3 the other two do as well but that's kind of expected in a business laptop not so much in a thin gaming laptop what should be noted though is
that that variable refresh rate is not g-sync so with OLED panels it's very difficult to get variable refresh rates because your brightness is somewhat tied to your refresh rate so this right here would just have several like I don't know what the numbers are but like 48 60 52 blah blah blah up to 120 all pre-calculated for the brightnesses to make sure that it works just nice now one thing that I was immediately concerned about when I saw this design was the keyboard cuz it is a little bit
weird just like how they include macafee on their devices as you can see here though we do have four zones of RGB there is going to the option for individual key RGB as well in the future and my fears that they might have screwed it up based on the Zero lattice design were completely unfounded these right here especially for a gaming laptop are some of the best keys that I've felt they have that really nice satisfying travel but also if you look there's no key movement when I'm pushing
it like this I can push on the side whole key actuates at the same time it feels actually fantastic this right here is one of the rare gaming laptops where I would like it for both typing and gaming it's maybe even a little bit stiff for gaming but I really like typing on my gaming laptops for performance we get up to an in Ultra 9 185h and an RTX 470 with up to 80 Watts dedicated the GPU with 15 watts of dynamic boost HP does claim that this is going to be the best cooled 14-in laptop
which I'm sure is something Asus will be very pleased to hear for Phillips head screws later and we are in and oh wow that is one heck of a vapor chamber look look at the size of this guy it just covers the entire thing we cannot see any of like the ram any of the CPU any of the GPU it is just Vapor chamber here how do you guys not have issues with it like drying out with it being so large that is okay maybe they can say it's the best cooled I don't know we'll have to test it later also in here we can see
that we have our SSD which is removable like to see that and a 71w battery that the claim is good for up to 11 hours away from the wall which in a gaming laptop like this means that you can kind of just daily drive this thing for all of your needs and then just be able to game after instead of a lot of gaming laptops where it's like you can game and everything else is pretty bad The Omen transcend 14 is expected to start at "$2,000 the Spectre 14 $4.99 we're not" totally sure about the 16 yet and
they're all available now so you can you can just do it just like I can do the end of this video thank you for watching hit like like get subscribed and just have a great old day and maybe you know look at some Vapor Chambers
