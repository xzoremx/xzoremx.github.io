I love getting a new laptop as much as anybody does but I got to say looking at the kit to build my very own AMD powered framework 13 laptop investment in framework disclosure I kind of wish I hadn't auctioned off my Intel one for that BC Children's fundraiser it was kind of cool that it was my laptop of thesis forever and I could keep putting new Hardware in it oh well such is life let's unbox this thing I am looking at the framework laptop 13 DIY kit it comes with with bezel oh ah purple bezel
that's a choice there's a keyboard now with non shattered fingerprint sensor power adapter don't need that that's optional you don't have to order that that's one of the cool things about framework IO expansion modules we'll get to those later and of course some memory and storage though similarly you can simply Doo if you want to expand outside of the range of options that framework provides to up to 64 gigs of DDR R 55600 memory and up to 8 terab of storage at least at the present time if there are
future ssds that are available in Greater capacities there's no reason it couldn't support them a bazillion more expansion modules we really will get to those later the only tool we'll need to assemble this and now the star of the show I was actually the first one to be Hands-On with framework's ryzen 7000 series framework 13 but but since that Hands-On time they have improved it in a lot of ways for one thing it doesn't blue screen constantly it was pre-production at the
time for another they have upgraded the hinge now not only is it a little bit heavier but it opens up 180Â° which I mean when I was in university I actually used my laptop like that all the time we didn't have smartphones and the screen is now available with a mat option that's designed to be usable in basically any lighting conditions is rated for 400 nits Peak brightness and we found it actually exceeded that fairly substantially while we get this built which shouldn't take too long we
can talk about some of the speeds and feeds it's available with either a ryzen 5 or ryzen 7 processor so that's with six or eight cores respectively and it's worth noting guys that this is ryzen 7000 so while these CPUs do have an npu for AI Tom Foolery what they don't have is enough tops to be co-pilot ready uh or to run features like Windows call whether that matters to you or not I leave entirely up to you I've got to say I admire framework's dedication to sodm memory upgrades they will run at a
slower speed compared to soldered memory but they will be upgradeable in the future which is pretty nice to see and they're still running at 5600 which is actually not that bad even compared to some gaming laptops that we've seen it's possible actually it's probable that we will see future configurations that are AI ready I mean they've got a risk five board coming did you see that ah that is so cool but at this time you will be just regular intelligent since we're in here this is a good time to have a look
at our battery the two versions come with different capacities either 55 W hours or 61 wat hours and both are rated to have I think it's 80% of their total capacity after a th000 charge and discharge Cycles pretty darn impressive you'll be using this thing for a very long time and once you aren't using it anymore 1 2 three screws is all it takes to rip it out and replace I guess I haven't really talked about the main pitch for framework that was it that was the build process this thing is
incredibly serviceable and the storage RAM and Wi-Fi card are all interchangeable actually that Wi-Fi card is something that I would probably want to take out AMD seems to have an agreement with all of their Partners to use these mediatech Wi-Fi chipsets with their ryzen mobile processors and I'm not a huge fan it's Wi-Fi 6C Bluetooth 5.2 which is fine I guess but I would really rather have Wi-Fi 7 and probably an Intel chipset we've got 2 watt stereo speakers a cooling solution that somehow
has managed to stand the test of time like that is darn impressive the way that you've been able to upgrade these framework laptops Through the Ages here and my friends that's it now all we got to do  like that conveniently framework has little guides that you can access by simply scanning these QR codes available online pops on a little something like that oh my god did this just turn on well cool close that real quick get this screwed together uh yours won't do that of course because yours won't already
have been tested by the labs team while we're closing it up the chassis is as before made out of a single machined piece of aluminum giving it excellent structural rigidity and now is a perfect time to have a look at our expansion cards they have so many options available you can put a display port port on your laptop you can expand with micro SD you can just put a little one tbte expansion thing you could have usba a you could have USB C you could put fullsize HDMI port any combination you
want the framework 13 supports four of these expansion cards and the framework 16 supports up to six I think it is my usual load out is 2 C's both of which can be used for charging which is really can be neat you just kind of put them in wherever you want and then I like to have an HDMI and I like to have a USB type A although these other ones are very cool as well and I will often carry around an extra oh yeah one of the ones I love there it is ah yes my 2 and 1/2 gig ethernet expansion
just slide that in a little something like like so and I have 2 and 1/2 gig L baby and because they just use USB type-c I can use this on anything it's not just a framework expansion card oh the 3 and2 mil Jack one is for the framework 16 cuz it doesn't come with a 3 and a half mil Jack right yeah okay this one does have a 3 and half millim Jack by default though let's get these expansion cards installed I like to have that on the left because that way if I have a dongle
for my mouse or I'm using a Wired Mouse it's not going to interfere with my movements then I like my typ C's at the back cuz I'm often using them for power and then my HDMI can go there so so convenient so customizable that's honestly probably my favorite thing about this laptop oh yeah and I guess that ignores the 3x2 display it is great having a taller display like this for productivity and it's about to get even better they have a 2.8k 120 HZ version of the display coming what so
I'm using the 60 HZ version like a pleb we actually found that the matte display while suitable for any indoor environment and most outdoor environments was not overly bright overly color accurate or overly great for gaming which I wouldn't have said was a concern on the previous Intel models because as you guys can see from the performance numbers here the CPUs and gpus and those aren't great for gaming but on the AMD model you can actually play some real games on this
thing so I would say that higher refresh rate display is going to be a really big upgrade even if you only run it at you a quarter of the resolution with uh integer scaling why did I even have my toolkit out here coming soon to LTT store.com but I didn't I didn't need it that's it the whole thing is built it really is that simple and you don't have to run Windows you can get a DIY version that's pre-loaded with absolutely nothing and run a variety of Linux distributions on your framework 13 as
well I wish I had my old one in hand for a side by side comparison it seems like they've changed the keyboard a little bit I don't remember this longer escape and delete key I'm going to try that in a moment though with first this message from our sponsor manscaped thanks to manscaped for sponsoring this video for the bald Kings out there or soon to be bald Kings check out their new dome shaver Pro head shaver and Dome smoother aftershave lotion from manscape the Dome shaver pro has five premium rotary

shipping let's try out this keyboard see how it feels I've always been appreciative of how good framework's keyboard feels considering um well you know the fact that it's a boo laptop in what is still a very reasonable thin form factor like you would think they would have to give up somewhere but the keyboard is not it they manage 1.5 mm of travel which is pretty typical or even above typical in this size class and the feel and sound is overall okay it's not the best keyboard
on the market but all things considered it is pretty darn good and what's cool is it's available in a wide variety of configurations something that is not necessarily an option on you know glued together bolted together laptops like other manufacturers make built-in Hardware privacy switches for both the 1080p webcam and the included microphone allay last time I had a look at these I was pretty impressed by the quality of the camera but that was before I saw any of the uh Snapdragon X Elite machines
it's still fine it's good enough especially when you consider that this is pretty challenging conditions with a light right behind me like yeah these are these are just generally very challenging conditions but the expectations are going to change in a big way now that we've got the ISP built onto those Snapdragon X Elite processors and they're going to be able to use more similar camera modules to what you see in a typical smartphone I like the new matte display it has some issues though
we observed that the auto brightness sensor causes the gamma and color accuracy to go kind of out of whack when you over stimulate it um like it's to be clear it's fine for daily use for an average consumer under a vast majority of conditions but we just have observed a little bit of odd behavior and a little bit of lesser performance in terms of color accuracy compared to the glossier panel that was in our Intel framework laptop that we used for comparison hopefully that's something
they can get resolved in software or firmware but one thing they won't be resolving is that it's not really suitable for Creative work so maybe we'll see a difference when they launched the 2.8k version that's one of the best things about these things having ryzen in them now is you can actually flipping game on them this is USB hey modern laptops only have USBC I'm just kidding there we go I have any IO I want I suck at Rocket League by the way please don't judge me but what matters
is the performance hey there we go now we're sitting at like 70 FPS 70 plus very very playable even if you might want a little bit more if you're you know a competitive player I didn't even notice how Bloody quiet this thing is I guess I don't have any complaints especially if it comes with these performance benefits it not only outperformed our Intel model and gaming it also outperformed our Intel model in productivity at least creative productivity it won blender cin bench
and Puget bench but lost ul's office proon though not by a huge margin I guess having more cores is still a good thing long as you don't want your battery to last too long it also beat our Intel framework in battery life in both endurance and in our stress test it's hard to tell exactly what to cover and not cover with a device like this I mean yeah normally we would discuss the weight which is you know kind of mid uh we would discuss the you know chassis Flex kind of mid as well but these are
all things that haven't changed since the original framework I just can't take for granted that you guys have watched  speakers those actually get really loud uh quality is fine they're really loud though if you're into that the trackpad continues to be a trackpad It's Made of Glass it supports gestures it's about average size not the biggest but also not restrictively small and I think that's pretty much it it's time to start daily driving this thing and I'll let you guys know on the WAN
show if I have any additional thoughts but overall it seems like it's still a framework they haven't lost track of their mission and as long as you're willing to pay a bit of a premium because yeah they're not the cheapest devices to have something that you can upgrade and repair and service as needed then they continue to serve that purpose extremely well subscribe to Short Circuit
