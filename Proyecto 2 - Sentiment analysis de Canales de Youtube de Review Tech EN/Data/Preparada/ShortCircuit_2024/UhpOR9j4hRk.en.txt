we got the new Corsair 1 i500 and it's so expensive that it showed up in a Pelican case I I don't know what to say  is it's got a lot of expensive components don't want to break it or  God as you can see they have made it larger than the past I kind of wish we had the old one here for an example but it used to be more like this a lot more Square uh they've extended it out the back I don't know if that's just to fit the 4090 that's inside this thing or if it's to fit their 240 mm uh AO that's
attached to the 4090 on top of the 120 mil AIO that's attached to the 14900 K because yeah this thing it's got a lot of strength it's real strong they've got this like soft fabric mesh that I'm actually really into we've been seeing uh more mesh side panels come into Vogue they've been on sff for quite a while but uh especially with the fractal North how that can come with a mesh side panel I'm really I'm really digging it I'm really a big fan tempered glass is out and look at how
easily you just you just pop that off it's you know it's no problem it also comes with a handy dandy little headphone hanger that you just kind of pop in there put some headphones there real great it can fit Mex and it's you know a lot bigger it's going to go much deeper in your desk and you're going to keep it vertical it's going to fit but honestly can it stay cool it has a lot of ventilation like this this is all vents vents at the top with what two two fans yep two fans blowing out the top
kind of like the old design that went top to or bottom to top and then we've got more vents out the back so and then what's on the bottom more Vents and rubber feet in terms of just form factor and looks with the fancy new wood panels as well I kind of like it before I crack it open and take a look inside let's talk about the I/O we've got a couple of USB ports on the front with a USBC and head phone jack and then on the bottom there's nothing but then on the back 4 usba all nicely labeled as 2.0 thank you
very much display port HDMI and then a USBC and then a 3.2 a couple more 3.2 2 1/2 gig Lan and then what looks like a wireless antenna dongle um audio on the bottom and spiff I'm not sure how to open this we're going to start by taking off these cool fabric side panels and then take a look at all of these screws I'm just going to start removing screws that's uh that's usually your best bet once you got these four screws off you just pop it open look at this super easy to get to all these internals oh what
side's this side the back actually pretty nice Cable Management though there's not a ton of room to work in cases like this and uh with a 4090 there's a lot of power going there and with all the fans they've got something like four or five fans in this thing they've actually done a pretty good job with cable management nothing's like sticking out uh you still got room for another 2 and A2 in SSD if you want to put one in and they've got included SATA cables so it should be as easy as
screwing it in and hooking it up so that's really nice uh but what we really want to see is this side look at this we've got one two three fans okay we're going to take out four more screws to get this top off one kind of annoying thing and a good reason to have an LTT store screwdriver is unlike the initial four screws for the side panels these are not a standard phillips bit it's really not the end of the world a lot of people have these but uh I would have loved to see the exact
same screw head on every single screw uh once they're all off though you just pop that cover off we get access to our two fans so they've got the GPU Radiator on the 240 mil way up here with two exhaust fans and then we've got our CPU radiator ah on 120 down here now 120 mm for a 14900 K it's not enough if you're going to try to sit there and run cinam bench or prime 95 you're going to hit 100 C that's not really what I'd recommend the Corsair one for this is for a small form
factor high-end gaming rig now when we get to gaming and temps and all that you will see that 120 mm it's sufficient you're not going to get you know 60 degrees C when you're gaming but it's honestly not bad more on that later once you take out these other two little tiny philli screws here and here you can open this up isn't that cute I actually really really like this design um all of a sudden you know you're going to get a lot more access to your CPU if you actually want to take this off and take
that out and swap it out um otherwise we just got some dual Channel ddr5 memory "here pretty sure it's 6,000 megat" transfer per second which is pretty decent it's nothing you know it could be faster these days but it's definitely not bad if you want to get get at the GPU you're going to have to take this fan and shroud off okay just pull it down and then you can see this crazy water block just on the die I've never seen a water blocked 490 like this um but our temps were okay so whatever
they're doing it seems fine I didn't look at vram temps but uh should be all right and as you can see yep it's got these two hoses going all the way up to this 240 mil rat at the top let's close this all back up power it on and take a look but not before word from our sponsor thanks secret lab for sponsoring today's video are your gaming sessions leaving you in pain do you have to stand up and stretch after every email secret lab is there for you your back and your butt their ergonomic highquality chairs
are designed to provide maximum Comfort all day long they even come in a variety of eye-catching upholsteries so there's a style for everyone check out secret lab at the link below it has to be turned on for this feature to work but you're plugging things in you can't see where the ports are what cable you're holding holding you just kind of like put your hand down here a little bit and it pops a light up for you don't get me wrong we got a bunch of Studio lighting it's easy to see but when this thing is
like behind your desk your lights are off you got to do a certain cable that's really handy and I kind of wish there was a light on basically every case I own now by the io and then on the front we've got these two diffused RGB strips I wish they were a little bigger or I wish the metal didn't quite overhang as much as it does but in the dark it's actually quite visible the really cool thing is it's got all the different color presets on this bar so you don't like the color you just swipe your
finger down change it to something else and then you just stop it once you're on something you like and then on the bottom if you press and hold I believe it is it'll cycle through different modes pretty neat they do have software in here so you can control it all from uh your desktop but I mean you know I don't know I kind of like this it's a really minor thing but I love it I love tactile features let's see how it performs though with a 14900 k and a 4090 we've got cyberpunk running in the
back background and it's just the main menu but we're hitting like 80c 75c that's fine cuz it's you know we're gaming we're just setting up OBS and checking our screen recording for uh 4K cyberpunk and uh we took a look at the temperatures it has definitely increased a little bit over time here we're hitting our Max of 98c or even 100 C on our core Max for our CPU like I said before Corsair I know that for gaming it's fine the performance is actually going to be good it's just running hot
not but please I don't like seeing it go red just put try to fit another 240 in here you made the case so much bigger stick a second 240 it would help so much at least I think I like to think it would anyway in terms of gameplay performance 4K Ultra rate tracing on we were getting like 40 FPS you turn dlss on set it to Quality which still looks good has some artifact issues here and there but you know if you're not too sensitive to that it's fine but look very playable 80 FPS with like 70 on our
1% lows high 60s mid 60s totally fine and really R tracing is it worth it not usually it looks really good but man the performance tanks so just turn that off too and you're good to go the reality is we're getting about what you'd expect from a 14900 k and a 4090 the really good news is though unlike our CPU our GPU on that 240 rad is actually doing pretty good our hot spot only 70° Max I mean it's already down to like 40 cuz you can hear the fans they're cranked they're really trying to keep it cool
but uh it's a 4090 and it's staying well within spec so you know put some speakers on put some headphones on keep them on the headphone hook just ignore the fans to test out thermals Labs tested F1 4k retracing on the CPU side we got a Max of 81 with an average of 59° but on our GPU it didn't even crack 70 reaching a Max of 69 nice nice and an average of 67 it's pretty good considering it's a small form factor those GPU temperatures are also pretty impressive we compared it to an
Alienware R15 with a 490 in it and it got a little worse than that that thing crept up as high as 82 Max on the GPU and then it only averaged at 80° C moving on to combuster that Gap Narrows just a little bit on the alien wear we see a Max of 75 with an average of 72 while our Corsair 1 sticks at 70° C with a average of 67 over overall pretty impressive last but not least in our cinam Bene test the two different systems we tested do have slightly different CPUs we've got a 13900 KF in
the Alienware but they're both going to Thermal throttle reaching upwards of 100° C on the coair max of 98 on the Alienware however the Alienware does keep a much lower average of 79° C these I9 are really hard to cool doesn't matter what you put on them nhd15 420 mil rad like it just it doesn't matter unless you go full custom Loop they're going to run hot however that significantly lower temperature on the Alienware is largely because it's thermal throttling itself and as soon as
it gets up there it just comes right back down to keep itself in Spec because it's able to maintain those clock speeds and it does boost a little higher on the i 94900 k our 1080p results they're pretty good they actually beat out the alien wear quite substantially in a couple of our tests however when we get to 1440p and 4K uh the Gap kind of Narrows a little bit bit you can really tell that they're using the same GPU and that 490s don't thermal throttle that easily because of all the cooling
attached to them even though this one's on a 240 mil rad and not the stock cooler we're seeing results that are almost neck and neck pretty much the exact same across the board as soon as you're upping your resolution and going to a more GPU bound kind of scenario I do expect most of you to get this as a gaming PC but in terms of productivity it's pretty good here's some Labs results so you can see for yourself overall not a bad system at all as for price now we're talking about the Alienware R15
when we compare it to this new Corsair 1 and the R15 is the old model the 16 goes for surprisingly about "$4,000 the Corsair 1 with basically the" same specs although some very minor differences we'll get to is "$4,700 the Alienware is also on sale" right now knocking the price down even further if you go for the corser one there are advantages I mean one it's small form factor you're going to pay the sfff tax on top of that it does have slightly faster memory and while it's
only about a $40 difference if you're just buying the CPU separately this one does have integrated Graphics so if you ever have to stop and troubleshoot "you're all set almost $5,000 can seem" like quite a bit of money but don't forget that the graphics card in here alone is almost two grand and the fact that you're getting a pretty slick case a lot of cooling there was quite a few fans in here performance was good XMP came enabled out of the box if you're looking at high-end Boutique pre-builts
then you're kind of splitting hairs when it comes to a few more100 anyway I think it looks really good and at the end of the day it kind of just comes down to taste do you like the way this looks and performs better than the competition I mean I do I don't know if I'd buy it but it's pretty sweet thanks for watching short circuit if you want to take a look at another pre-built that you could consider buying from a pretty reputable brand check out the main gear mg1 great computer we still use
it see you later
