woohoo it's new Macbook day my favorite day on short circuit it only comes usually once a year this is the MacBook Pro M4 looks pretty similar to the last one but now it has an M4 instead of an M3 I'm not going to lie I am more of an M3 kind of guy but I can rock an M4 if I have to we've got their usual mag safe 3 to USBC 2 m sleeved nice cable and then a charging brick Oh I ripped it 70 wat USBC charging at least with the 14in I'm not sure what comes with the rest and then the usual Apple propaganda these
still come with Apple stickers right do these not come with Apple stickers anymore bro what's the point in even buying them then it's probably good for the planet or something now if you're wondering I am still rocking the same Intel MacBook Pro over here I haven't upgraded yet so this is again another instance of me going hm maybe it's finally time except when I got to set today I realized tragedy struck we bought the wrong MacBook it is still an M4 Pro it's a good form factor we got
the 14in here in the sexy space black color profile you can also get it in silver of course but there was a horrible error made and I'm not going to tell you just yet you're going to have to wait a second because first I need to go over the outside of this thing we've got an HDMI 2.1 port a USBC Thunderbolt Port an SD card reer and then on the other side another two USBC Thunderbolt ports 3.5 mil combo audio jack and mag safe there is an upgrade here on the USBC ports they're now Thunderbolt 5
instead of Thunderbolt 4 at least on the pro and Max models uh the base M4 spec only is Thunderbolt 4 and that's good for 120 gbit which is up to 3 times faster than Thunderbolt 4 on the inside bam it's it's pretty much the same keyboard look at that I think it is exactly the same keyboard pretty similar touchpad and then there is the display it looks pretty much the same same resolution same xdr fancy technology it "is 1,000 nits Peak brightness when" you're Outdoors instead of 600 so that
should help with outdoor visibility um there is another change I'm going to tell you about in a bit but the big thing is the new nanotexture option which is an anti-glare coating and as you can tell we don't have it and I saw I Justine's video when it came out look at the difference what the hell you can't even use the one on the right and the one on the left looks beautiful it actually seems to work really well I can't wait to try it myself and honestly I think based on that if you're somebody
that does a lot of work in bright spaces or Outdoors or places with Reflections that could be reason enough alone to upgrade we weren't able to get it because trying to get these laptops in Canada where we're from the supply chain kind of sucks and it would have resulted in us getting the laptop like 3 weeks later and we already did get it late I get it but I really wanted it just like I want you to hear about our sponsor dbrand and us I guess because we just dropped our new circuit board skin in
collaboration with dbrand it's freaking sick it features a custom circuit board layout based on real PCB traces and actually has a textured skin so you can feel it and honestly it seems to improve the grip of the device there's three different colorways glow circuit short circuit and dark circuit and the glow circuit one as you can guess freaking glows in the dark so much so that we built a UV Arch to charge up Linus's car that we wrapped with it so check it out at the link below where dbrand also has
their Black Friday sale with up to 50% off dbrand.com blackf Friday or sl4 fo9 look at that it's a laptop the most talked about change with any new Macbook generation is the CPU we've gone from M3 to M4 this specifically is the M4 Pro base model so we've got the 12 core CPU and 16 core GPU with 24 GB of RAM but there is also a beefier version that comes with two extra CPU and four extra GPU cores that comes standard on the 16-in variant in fact you can't even get a non-pro M4 16in MacBook Pro uh you can
on the 14-in but not the 16 now compared to last generation this is obviously not Apples to Apples I mean it is Apples to Apples because they're both Apple products but not a great comparison cuz this is a 16 and this is a 14 regardless M3 Pro to M4 Pro base model you get one extra CPU core which is I guess an upgrade right off the bat you also are getting two more of your cores as performance cores instead of efficiency cores we'll have to see if that actually makes a a difference but in theory it it
probably should as for the GPU it's two more cores regardless of if you're going for the bass or Bey M4 Pro the M4 chips also feature second generation Ray tracing which should make your games even more Ray traced if you're trying to rate trce them and maybe faster and blender with Ray tracing I don't know we'll have to see the other big thing is memory bandwidth from 150 GB a second to 273 GB a second should in theory be good for memory intensive workloads either way it's an upgrade so I'm not
complaining man this new display I don't have high refresh rate on my Intel MacBook and I like there's another new thing with these new displays that hasn't really been talked about and apple didn't really mention but we got some Insider info on they're both on the same settings on the P3 profile in promotion refresh rate we got the high refresh rate and on auto brightness so if I open this test on blur Busters you might notice a bit of a difference between them this guy you can see the lines look
super nice and white and clear consistently but if you look at the old screen do you see how it kind of goes blue as the lines are moving this is called cyan Flash and what's happening is the LEDs that drive the display the red LEDs are a little bit slower to respond than the rest about one frame worth you probably wouldn't notice why you're like using Google Docs but if you move around a white object for instance on a black screen you kind of get this weird effect on the new one it's gone and that's
because the new display is quantum dot they didn't say that but it is aside from fixing the cyan flash these Quantum dots would in theory improve the color accuracy although Apple tries really hard to hit the exact DCI P3 color gamut which means even though this display could probably be quite a bit more color accurate than this one uh it's not really going to see a huge difference we'll check the lab tests in a sec and then it also means that this display is likely more power efficient than this
one because of the quantum dots that's probably part of how Apple was able to obtain a 2hour supposed better battery life on the new models but I don't have data to check that because we didn't have an equivalent previous laptop to test against it is as Apple claimed when you are outside or you shine a flashlight at the light sensor to make it think like you're outside it will hit a th000 nits in SDR content across a 100% window the entire display that's pretty awesome it also will hit even
higher in HDR mode the same 1600 nits we measured a tiny bit higher but overall great performance the one weird thing is in HDR the color accuracy by default is not that great I don't know if it's like Apple trying to do like the Costco thing where they make things oversaturated but in the default xdr profile HDR color accuracy is kind of bad if you switch to the HDR video color profile it's excellent the other new thing in the display region is the webcam it's a 12 megapixel Center Stage camera that
features desk view now what is that I will show you Center Stage automatically adjust your camera to keep it in view great great this is what Center Stage does it basically just it's AI Zoom bro it's very smooth right like does this feel kind of natural but what is desk view yo what is this the camera is super wide angle but they're like cropping a section of it so that you can have like a top down camera even though it's just from your webcam so look oh look at my sick top down
camera I'm doing an unboxing it's short circuit setion can you guys see look at that this is silly but also kind of cool like if you're just trying to show your your mom something it's it's kind of limited cuz you got to tilt the camera like I feel like they're this was some apple Engineers like hackathon project and it's like it's kind of cool but I feel like people are probably not going to use this very often while we're in here we might as well try out the speakers let's get some crab Rave
going they sound really solid no surprises there as for software there is Mac OS COA now very exciting Apple intelligence is featured in it but we can't use it cuz we're still on the wait list thanks Apple other than that it looks pretty similar I don't know what the difference is on the new Mac OS I don't pay attention and usually to be honest I don't even update my MacBook until like the next next version is out because Apple just likes to ship a new OS every year and usually it's kind of
dog for the first few months don't at me it's just a fact let's try the blender monster under the bed demo I'm going to start with GPU this one is an 18 core and this is a 16 core but this does have the new R tracing stuff so maybe it's faster or still I wouldn't be surprised if it is not faster or but it would be pretty cool if the new base model Pro is faster than the old upgraded Pro in a larger chassis look at that dude 54 seconds 1 minute and 8 seconds it's faster it's a smaller chassis it's the
lower spec one it's still faster at least on the GPU end what if we try and CPU oh my God this is going to take 6 minutes Jesus Christ 8 minutes remaining on this one and 6 minutes remaining on this one I can't really go off of the ETA but like we have more performance cores the CPU test is a little more interesting to me because these do have the same number of CPU cores the chassis size difference is immediately apparent because this one is already ramping up to be honest you pretty rarely hear the
fan in these laptops and the 16 the 16  quiet I can't hear anything while this was running I wanted to check and see what the TDP of these different laptops is because I mean this one seems to be going quite a bit faster and I don't know if that would be possible without drawing a bit more power and according to notebook check the M3 Pro should be a TDP of around 27 watts and the M4 pro at least the 12 core option is 32 watts with a boost up to 40 and then the 14 core is 40 Watts with a boost up to 46
so not like a ton more power but like a few Watts all right there we have it 6 minutes 31 seconds 8 minutes 20 seconds I don't know man that's pretty freaking huge let's do one more thing for funsies I don't want to run cine bench oh yeah look at that cinebench reports 3.1 versus 3.5 gz I don't know how it determines that maybe it's just like the average GHz bam they're done finally holy crap dude 1417 points on this test 1450 in the "last one and 1,074 on this one that is"
like more than 300 points more 350 maybe even 400 almost that's a lot more points it's pretty impressive that this is the last gen beefy one in a bigger chassis and this new one is Still rocking it even as a base model that being said they definitely are putting more power in here you got more gigahertz on this one4 more gigahertz to to be exact and you have more pees and clearly it shows this thing freaking rips despite the higher power CPU apple is actually claiming more battery life on the new
models maybe that's in part due to the fancy new display even though they don't say that but we don't have an exact model to compare against previously we did at least test this one and it ran in just about 12 hours which is pretty much what we would expect for an Apple device a far cry from Apple's claimed 22 hours of video playback but we aren't doing it probably in the exact way they expect we're using the Plex app in our tests um but definitely in a class that Apple
laptops are expected to be several hours better than Windows gaming laptop for instance and definitely still excellent I mean overall I'm here for it it's a Macbook and they actually made it faster This Time by like a lot so overall it actually this thing seems pretty sick if you're somebody that has high performance requirements video editing probably photo editing blender all of those things you're going to see a consist considerable performance increase over last gen I don't know if
that necessitates upgrading if you're already on M3 but if performance matters to you here you are this thing freaking rips maybe it is time for me to finally upgrade I feel like I've said that every time now and I you should get the fancy screen the fancy screen looks sick so if you like this video get subscribed let me know down in the comments what you think about the new Macbook I feel like it's time for a design refresh but I'm I'm just stoked for the screen I'm stoked for the performance and I'm
stoked for you bye
