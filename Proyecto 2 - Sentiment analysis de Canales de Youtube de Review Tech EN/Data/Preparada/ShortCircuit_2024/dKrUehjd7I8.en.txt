if you're anything like me you are absolutely utterly exhausted at looking at the random BS new feature that somebody has put in to a Wi-Fi router to sell to people on Amazon it looks like a spider or it has RGB no this is a Wi-Fi router that doesn't have it just has things that you know a Wi-Fi router should have and uh ginet sponsored us to check this out this is their Flint 2 and just just look at this we've got Wi-Fi 6 we got fast Wi-Fi we have two 2.5 gbit ports rather than you
know a lot of the ones you see online where it's like oh it's got 2.5 g oh yeah it's just the WAN so if you have a 2.5 gig connection and you want a hardw computer too bad buy something else this one they at least included two it's got multi-wan support it runs open wrt just an operating system that's open source it just works and best of all VPN and not just some layo VPN you can run a wire guard server a a private VPN for yourself so you can connect to your devices at home anywhere in the world or
you know stream your internet connection through your home connection securely at 900 megabit almost a gigabit off of a $200 Wi-Fi router which is pretty freaking sick I like these these are like the convertible power bricks we can kick it onto here does it come with the other ones hey it does so you could travel with this look at that oh cute I didn't actually realize that this has redundant hardwired wian which is super cool so we'll see in a few minutes here but I imagine you can
probably use this as like a catch the Wi-Fi and repeat it you can also use a hardwired wi you could use two hardwire WS you can probably connect cellular to this thing there's a USB port to tether your phone too and those two hardwired w ports are both the 2.5 gig and you can see right there you can switch it between Lan and lamb like I mentioned before so you could use this to pass a faster than 1 gig internet connection to a device or a switch or something like that they've also got four more 1 gig
ethernet ports so you can use this uh for most of your devices like a switch 12vt DC jack USB 3 port on the side oh look it's got the little um Keyhole Mount so you can mount this on the wall or to something metal with the LT Cable Management product we have a little thing that goes in the keyhole stick it in there tighten the thing that one on magnetic you ready for this can we see it bam cable managed it's kind of awesome you can have like your PC right there and just like mount it to the back
of the PC or to the PC case magnets Let's uh let's do some Wi-Fi stuff wow look at all these see I was right multi-wan we've got ethernet one ethernet 2 repeater and tethering all right let's connect it to the Wi-Fi too why not right let's set up a multiwan here why not oh right here repeater options oh beautiful that's easy band selection five apply connect oh you can even lock it to a specific access point if you have multiple access points or set a static IP on this which is nice
we've now got the ethernet that's coming into it and the office Wi-Fi going to this and then it's beaming internet back to me so if I were to go into this and say yo dog it's failover right now load balance use multiple interfaces to increase the total bandwidth whoa let's disconnect unplugged and we're still vibing obviously the paint is going be a lot worse on Wi-Fi but unconnected disconnected see imagine you're on like a cruise ship or something hey and there we go bam now we have two internet
connections again and it's so easy like that did not take any fancy hacker man setup I just literally connected to the Wi-Fi network but that's only two how about three connections H East two iOS boom three connections now all right let's unplug that boom we're not going through the cellular on my phone over USB aside from that it can do all of the other normal things that routers do you can play around with your IPS either in a advanced or easy way you can set up a firewall you can open ports you can have
a guest Network you can do DNS over htps or TLS you can change the network but yeah you can actually run this thing just as an access point if you already have a router you can totally do that there's IPv6 support you can change the Mac addresses you can do pretty much anything you could do with any other router plus they have the cool VPN stuff and not just you can run a VPN server on these which like I said before is a really strong suit so say you're from the states and you have like bomb
Netflix but you're you happen to be overseas somewhere and they have crap Netflix well connect to your home home network and watch whatever Netflix you would watch like you were at home you can also connect to zero tier or tail scale natively which is super nice tail scale and zero tier if you're not familiar are peer-to-peer VPN solutions that are really awesome but let's try the wire guard server generate config start okay well that was easy profiles add a profile we'll call this Jake's
laptop ah it even it prompts you to use Dynamic DNS cuz if your IP address were to change EX internally uh you wouldn't be able to access this router right but it will let's say enable Dynamic DNS and it gives us okay sick you don't even have to like set up a service they just have their own Dynamic DNS service that's awesome it's been set up I have wire guard running on my laptop I've got my laptop connected to our 10 GB internet and this router is connected to a separate 1 gig connection that we have
for testing things out let's see how fast the wire guard connection is oh let's go 800 180 look at that boys and girls wow magic naturally if you were to use openvpn it would be a lot slower since openvpn is single threaded but wire guard freaking rips and the reason it can do that is due to the hardware acceleration on here it is a quad core mediatech chip so it's nothing like the super insane it's it's only a $200 router but the hardware acceleration is what makes this able to go so fast they
even have ad blocking on here not that I would recommend that because that does pay for me to feed my children my my child as a cat but still they got DNS over hgps they got aduard home they got wpa3 support for security they also have built in parental controls with bark that does require a subscription to use that other than that man it just it just Wi-Fi it Wi-Fi is good it routes good it does a VPN good it's not that expensive um you could also if you're like a traveler big travel person you could
host your own VPN on this thing and then get one of their cute little travel routers like the Slate ax or the barrel ax um and then you can run these as a VPN client you know what screw it let me show you how that works the provider is the Flint 2 router boom apply we now have our little baby slate ax travel router running is a VPN client for the VPN server that's running on the Flint 2 let's see how fast that goes damn look at that okay that's pretty ridiculous this is literally faster I don't know
how but it's faster little guy can run wire guard client at at gig down 500 up that's pretty good I mean you're probably not going to find a 1 gig connection while you're traveling but if you did it can handle it it's so little look how cute it is last but not least let's try the Wi-Fi set to 160 y this is still Wi-Fi 6 not Wi-Fi 6 so we shouldn't expect like above gigabit speeds per se but we should still be able to get some pretty fast Wi-Fi out of this thing this is a relatively
congested environment so I wouldn't expect anything like much crazier than this yeah it's about 600 both ways overall pretty stout little router I mean it can do really fast VPN it can do real fast Wi-Fi it has two 2.5 gig ports and for $189 I mean if I had to pick this or a gaming router I think the choice is pretty obvious again thanks to glette for sponsoring the video uh if you guys like what you saw here you can check it out at the link down below we'll also have their travel routers
linked down there those things are pretty sick get subscribed like the video and if you want more content why don't you check out the video I did on the barrel ax which is one of their little travel routers that think it's pretty sick
