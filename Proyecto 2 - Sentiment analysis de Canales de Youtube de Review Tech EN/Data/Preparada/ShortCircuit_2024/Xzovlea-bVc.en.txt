right out of the gate the cmf phone 1 has got me well a little confused I am familiar with the concept of budget-oriented sub Brands like honor or red magic or OnePlus it's just that nothing does well nothing to hide their Association putting their branding right on the side of the box and is nothing really such a premium brand that they need a sub brand I'm not saying they're bad products I'm just saying it feels a little bit like walking into an Ikea and finding ffp furniture for people branded
products next to the IKEA branded ones what really was the difference here one difference is of course the price the cmf phone 1 starts at just $200 and I've got to say getting this in my hands I don't believe it everything about this device from the design to the materials is deceptively premium feeling I mean this is made of plastic but it's not the kind of thing that I would notice if wasn't a materials nerd and I was just using my phone like a normal person even the bezels are yeah they're
on the bigger side compared to the latest Flagship devices but they're perfectly reasonable this my friends is a 120 HZ variable refresh rate 1080x 2400 AMOLED display on a flipping $200 phone they even advertise Peak "brightness of 2,000 nits meaning this" should be great for watching HDR content unfortunately our lab didn't measure anywhere near that high but at over 12200 nits that's still enough to blow out our top down camera and make for a very acceptable HDR experience and even
the speakers are surprisingly good or rather I should say speaker since there's no Amplified earpiece speaker but that's the kind of thing you expect to find on a budget phone and honestly I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit because we haven't even looked at the exterior one of the coolest things about this device is that this plastic backing which has this really cool kind of industrial look with screws on it is also extremely functional instead of buying cases for the phone one you
actually replace the entire back with any color you want which is the C in cmf which stands for color material finish that is such an Innovative idea and one that I can fully get behind because it has the maybe unintentional consequence of also making it easier to swap out the battery just because you can swap out the battery doesn't mean that you're going to get five to 10 years of uninterrupted service out of this thing because they are only committed to two years for major Android updates and
three years for security updates which is very much on the low side compared to competitors we're going to take a closer look at this after a mention for our sponsor oh no dearest Mr Sebastian a thread was published on your subreddit titled let's get D Brand's attention to sponsor lineus to dye his hair blonde again dbrand wanted to bring it back I thought they were going to sponsor me to D it again on the show or something I'm down dbrand come at me yeah yeah yeah it's going to be a big bag of money or
I'm not doing it though cuz my wife is not going to be into it today your evasive maneuvers will be ineffective before we Fork over a big bag of money we'd like to engage in the ageel tradition of try before you buy inside this box you will find hair bleach use it to dye a small portion of your hair right now on camera does it have to be on my head why don't for this portion I use the self camera on the nothing phone sorry excuse me the cmf phone 1 the rear camera is a 50 map Sony affair with an
assist camera that helps with portrait bokeh effects and the front camera is 16 megapixels from our experience photos are okay they're not the sharpest but nothing does manage to pretty reasonably balance skin tones as well as overall color accuracy as for video though because both the rear and front camera lack Optical image stabilization of any kind you'll find you're going to end up Focus hunting a little bit and in general they're they're not really great they're good enough they're better than
almost any laptop especially when you consider how challenging these conditions are but Belle you want to do the honors use it to dye a small portion of your hair this isn't even going to show up on camera you're just going to make me look like an idiot everywhere else listen this is what dbrand would want that's why they trusted me with this look dude dude the instructions say small want you to know I care deeply for this company and I would do anything to uh keep us going keep sponsors happy
okay um dbrand asked for a sample of what the dying my hair blonde sponsorship might look like and asked for a small part of my hair to be dyed  okay why I got a little out of hand I tried to massage it in and the circle just got bigger and bigger oh my gosh  serious yeah L they pay more anyway let's take a look at the exterior of this phone on the right side we've got a lock button on the top we've got a microphone for noise cancellation on the left we've got volume rockers or
one rather and then on the bottom a USB type-c port that mono speaker I mentioned before as well as our tray for the SIM card before we go any further I want to swap this out and see how long it takes and I'm going to use my LTT Precision screwdriver oh I love this okay okay first of all yeah that's super nice it comes with a Sim removal tool and everything you need to remove your old back plate so that's all fine and cool but it comes with a new little knobby P the point is that you can leave
your old colors as accents no way it has micro SD expansion and dual SIM what doesn't it have hey there we go okay it's like a leverage Point that's the internals of the phone stick how much are these accessory TOPS oh so cool like look if I want to have like a a black release knob and a black SIM tray I could do that boom accent I I love this now I just wish that I could have it on a phone that has NFC so while they manage to match or even beat some mid-tier phones in other ways like
for example offering 33 wat charging that manages to get to 50% in just half an hour it lacks wireless charging which is kind of an obvious one but it lacks NFC and with the prevalence of mobile payments these days I just don't see how that cannot be a deal breaker for so many people you know it's the kind of thing where I wouldn't even be that mad if everything else about this phone wasn't so darn enticing like even just the texture of this back super nice and in spite of the plastic back they've
actually managed to have decent enough cooling that the gaming performance matches the nothing 2A which is a device that costs up to like what about $150 more H there's just so much to like here even the fingerprint sensor was really good in our testing making it just an almost complete package at such a reasonable price this is one of those ones where I guess I have no choice but the cop out conclusion where I say I can't recommend this one it really does "just come down to NFC it's got 5,000"
milliamp battery it's gonna get like almost two days but I want to see a next gen that resolves that one issue at nearly the same price give it to me for $28 and like I won't just recommend it I'd fliping I'd flip and buy one of these I mean with that said it's not like I obviously have the most Discerning taste in phones subscribe to Short Circuit quick Biga closure on this uh this is what it looks like yeah D brand the W show is tomorrow you will be the sponsor for the rest of this
