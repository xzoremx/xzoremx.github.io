when it comes to keyboards I'm a huge sucker for a cool gimmick and so when EO maker offered to sponsor this video to check out their new dino Tab 75x and more I couldn't say no cuz it's got this cool optional smart screen that's built in 75% triple mode gasket mounted mechanical keyboard really cool three pin and five pin switches hot swappable upgraded foam kits I can tell you right now there's actually quite a lot of foam in here one of the things I'm not exactly sure of is their new high five
foam sheet I don't know how much better that actually makes any sounds or audio but uh I guess we'll find out but if you can see here what you should be able to  me it's got a cool screen on it and there's 540 LEDs that you can program yourself to display whatever you want on that screen it's super cool it's kind of like a couple of other keyboards I've looked at with displays but this time the nice thing is it's actually pointed at you so you're going to be able to look at all
the little blink LEDs when you turn them on and I'm more impressed by the key caps than I have been in quite a while let's check out what else is in the Box we've got our epomaker dyab 75x welcome sheet it's got three modes you can do 2.4 GHz Wireless you can do Bluetooth or you can do wired which is great I really love it when a keyboard isn't Wireless only I've bought a few for super cheap that are just so disappointing I just want to plug it in more importantly we get key cap and switch puller uh some
extra key caps if you're a Mac User option command it's obviously both Windows and Mac compatible which is always great and I'm a big fan of being able to swap keycaps uh I'm also a big fan of this colorway I really like the kind of lilac purple with this deeper purple on the escape in the enter and then the rest is just white with a nice purple Legend very pretty uh especially on the white keyboard the other one is black I believe so we'll take a look at that as well as for the cable it's not
bad it comes with this little leather or pleather strip I'm honestly not genuinely sure but it looks nice and it feels okay and then on top of that this Gable is thick it's not exactly sleeved but man it it sure feels like it in terms of girth uh otherwise you know it's got these really nice metal connectors that I'm a big fan of on the housing on the ends they've got these four screws on either side so while you do need one of those uh triangle heads to take it apart it's possible um a lot of the time
otherwise USB is just kind of annoying to open up and then they've got this similarly bulky end on the USBC side I'm actually okay with this not being sleeved because I think that the thick white cable actually really fits with the rest of this keyboard I've also noticed that they've got this cool digital display game and office mechanical keyboard label at the top I don't know how I feel about the label but I do really like that even though there's probably hot keys for changing
the wired or Wireless stuff you can just flick it on and off on the switch here uh Bluetooth wired 2.4 gig great to see that but before we actually plug it in I got to look at this keyboard itself and  this beautiful peel off screen looks a lot nicer now it's got adjustable feet which is always something I really love to see it's a feature that you don't often see in like really high-end Boutique boards um and I don't I don't know why maybe it's just because the metal meets
plastic as a bit of a pain to get right but um I prefer it because hey maybe you don't like this high of a typing angle okay that's fine go down now you're flat now it's good to go fantastic and then aside from that where's the dongle for this thing oh that's pretty cool I okay another very minor gripe I really wish this just swung open on a little hinge instead of fully coming off however that is a pretty Sleek design I didn't even see it right away and then when it's on there you barely even
notice it just kind of looks like a different piece of plastic it doesn't look like it's actually supposed to open until you take a look and check out that little clip part right there um we'll plug it in later what I also want to talk about is just how like stiff and Hefty this thing is it's all plastic but it doesn't feel too bad and you know I have felt a lot of pretty decent all plastic mechanical keyboards it also tends to drive the price way down more on that later and especially when you
add enough foam to it you can get a pretty decent sound out of it this could still be a little better especially considering how many foam layers they've got in there but it's honestly not bad out of the box the only thing I'd try to do if I were you is adjust the space bar a really big pet peeve of mine is when your space bar sounds significantly different that's true to honestly most keyboards just because the space bar is so long and Hollow compared to every another key on the board let's weigh it
let's how heavy is this thing I'm going to guess 2 lb two 2 lb it's a 75% layout obviously it's a Dap 75x so you're going to get more of a tkl style where there's no numpad attached which is good for a lot of people cuz imagine if there was an unpad this thing would be pretty long and it would take up a lot of desk space um to each their own oh look at that I was almost bang on "1,81 g 2 lb is like 900 it's a hot" swappable PCB which I mean it's 20 24 if you're not doing that I don't know what
"you're doing it's got a 10,000 milliamp" battery which is a lot admittedly but I don't know how much is going to the screen itself once it's lighting up or to the south facing RGB if you turn all "that off though 10,000 milliamp hours on" a regular keyboard is going to last you quite a while or at least it should let's boot it up but not before a word from our sponsor wait it's epomaker no let's just plug it in hello epomaker wow okay I don't know what the okay oo man I'm just a sucker for like RGB LEDs
lights in general I I always love Christmas lights as a kid you know you drive around the neighborhood look at all the Christmas lights uh this should this button here should both turn the screen on and off as well as changing the modes so let's try some of the different modes hello EO maker wow it's just like a bunch of RGB if you're seeing any weird flickering on your screen I assure you that's just the LEDs uh interacting with the way we're filming it it looks steady in person
looks totally fine um these patterns look okay it's really just like the full screen yeah it's got this weird flicker but that's okay and you know the screen definitely adds a lot of extra width to the whole thing but it's really not that bad I mean this doesn't take up that much desk space all things told let's try a good oldfashioned typing test and  go no man I was doing so good at the start and then that last half I had like three errors okay well 116 98% still ain't bad I like
it I'm still torn sometimes I love linear sometimes I love tactiles so let's try the other one and see which   quick I can tell you right now that the sound isn't that much better with the tactiles but it is a little and I kind of prefer it I also really like how they've got the legend on the front um on this key cap I love a blank Style key cap set it's just really nice it's really elitist and dumb but when you know how to type and you don't need it it's uh it feels pretty good we'll do a quick typing
test 11397 I screwed up a couple times but you know what it's still pretty good but overall I'm very pleasantly surprised I think for an all plastic chassis it actually sounds pretty decent I don't know if that Hi-Fi sound sheet is making much of if any difference at all but I like to see experimentation and I'm glad that they're actually at least trying something which is always cool and especially because it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg we're also going to try the dino tab 75 non-x
it doesn't have the screen it is less expensive but it's still pretty nifty ooh I love this like brown and maroon no not quite maroon but like a reddish brown mud kind of look almost knock to it but not quite I really like it uh but yeah if it wasn't obvious already instead of a screen you've got what's supposed to be a phone holder Ah that's pretty cool I really like being able to both put my phone here in case a notification comes up and I need to see it and is I've just got like a whole
second monitor now but what's especially neat is the idea that you can connect these via Bluetooth and then type on your phone and use your phone as your display and your kind of your computer oh my God there's some latency because it's Bluetooth and you know I can't put  mode but this is great it's hard I'm normally looking like several words ahead when I'm doing these typing tests and I can only see like three uh because it's in portrait and not landscape but that's really cool
I don't know how often anyone's actually going to use that feature but I do think it's pretty cool the only other major difference between this and the X version is the battery and it makes "sense this one's only rocking a 5,000" mAh battery but it's it's also not driving that big screen so I think that's fine it's still a pretty big battery for a wireless keyboard let's check out the software on the dyab 75x and then I'll tell you all about all the prices this looks pretty easy we've got
our function settings don't get me wrong guys I would love via compatibility um I am not someone who actually goes in and changes much if anything with their keyboards but I don't like proprietary software in general however this is working pretty well uh and it seems very simple and easy to use let's go to the screen let's make a little thing here oh yeah  upload wow my creation look at that that was the probably one of the easiest though that I've ever done with one of
these um either custom screen or uh not even keyboards like you can get little LED displays that you can plug in and do the same thing uh that was super easy to use I literally just drew it on here and then uploaded the picture you can also do a bunch of other cool stuff like say you want to do a little animation you can add frames I'm not going to like sit here and do anything but look I can add a frame I can subtract I can make I can copy the previous frame if you want to
like take your image copy it over and then move like a leg so that you make like a little dude running across it or something like that you can add pictures okay I got to try to put a picture on it I have to firm wow in all its pixel oh can I contrl Z oh my you can even contrl Z your uh last action if you accidentally draw on it like I just did but check this out upload picture it's a beautiful pixelated mess obviously that takes some fine tuning that is WID Linus however yeah you can
totally grab an image and pop it on here with 540 LEDs you've got quite a lot to play around with I wish there were one or two more rows but I guess then obviously the keyboard would be even taller or wider and so you know they're trying to they got they at some point you got to just choose and be like okay it's going to be this wide and this tall and I think what they've done here is pretty neat and if you want to just change RGB without using the hotkeys you can come in here and do that change it
to like Spectrum cycle or dynamic breathing or um waves Ripple I'm actually a big Ripple fan yeah it is ah yeah okay it's totally Rippling back up your configuration settings from the cloud so you can plug it in make an account download the software on a different computer use the same software there boom your same little animations and everything is already backed up and ready to go as for the price if you want the screen which I kind of do it's going to be $140 if you want to save a buck
and maybe use the other one just the regular non-x dyab 75 uh it's only 90 bucks so they shaved off a whole $50 for this LED screen and I guess half the battery but you know a lot of that batteries probably go into the screen either way if you want to check them out then we'll have them down in the links below thanks so much for watching if you want to check out another short circuit make sure to look at the rt100 from eil maker that was one with the little monitor screen I think Jamie took it home he loved
it see you later
