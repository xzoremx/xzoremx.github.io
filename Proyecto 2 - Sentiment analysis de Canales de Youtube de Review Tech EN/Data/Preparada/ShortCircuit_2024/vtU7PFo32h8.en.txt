sometimes you want to listen to music without shutting the whole world out and that's why shocks is sponsoring this video to tell you about their open Fit air open air I don't even know how to call this product they're not earbuds they go around your ear you see they look like this it's like a jewelry box look at this crisscross thing A Little Instruction Manual a little warranty or don't read this manual and a tiny a Toc cable checking out the case got the shocks logo on the front it's kind of
car in there you can feel it USBC on the back this is a really like kind of matte Soft Touch case there is an indicator light on the front and a little grippy spot for you to open this is a pretty compact case for having to hold a product that big and they just fit over top each other I wonder if it matters which order I put them in but it doesn't holy this is actually easier than normal earphones looking at the earbuds ear the these things themselves you've got this you think it's just kind of
flexible plastic or it's just the silicone bouncing around but there's actually a small wire in there it's made of nanl which is a nickel titanium alloy which is super elastic so this is supposed to make it so you can put these things on and have a lot of lot of comfort for long listing sessions I'm s this is just so light and so like there's just nothing to this it's interesting it's not light in a bad way can't wait to put this on but first you can look at there's some Pogo pins here
that's for charging this happens to be the left one I know that from this indicator there's a little Grill here for air moving in and out probably the sound comes out of there the drivers behind a little Grill there for venting and there are two microphones per headphone for active beam forming right there and right there I really want to put these on but the pairing happens when they're in the case so let's do that first I got the app installed it's already searching and I think I'm
supposed to press a button here there they are lots of stuff to look at in the app but let's just leave that for now and put these on so I'm looking at the picture here this part goes behind the ear feels like I'm wearing nothing at all nothing at all nothing at all wow yeah these are super light yeah shock says they put a lot of work into figuring out where to put the center of gravity on these things and where to put the pressure points so you can wear these for a long time have them feel
snug on there and also make them feel lighter than they even are and I will say if they're pretty on there other than when I really whip my head like that and they get some distance from the ear which is kind of fine because they just go back to normal after these are really staying on wow they're on 8 G each 75 with the Case Case itself F set so why would you want headphones like this number one thing probably safety your own safety if you're jogging at night or riding a
bicycle or even a well motorcycle you have a helmet on but still for your own safety these are great cuz my ear canals are open I can still put my finger in there so you can hear more what's going on around you which is cool but not only your own safety other people's safety I love ignoring my kids as much as the next guy but sometimes it's just not ethical to do so sometimes I want to listen music and also be able to hear if my children are screaming that's my personal old man James uh dad reason for
getting these so let's get some music on I'll interact with it to see how the controls work and then from there we'll go into the app first things first first musac all right it only has double tap and hold there's no single tap Pac colad song Let's go now we're cooking with gas so the interface on here is a little unconventional they don't have symmetry between the earbuds and they also don't have a single tap which is philosophical you know you don't want to have false
positives make everything a double tap so it's double tap on the left to pause and there's again there's no tactile button there you don't hear a little button going in your ear it's all capacitive and you can see how fast it reacts here when go do do it doesn't say do do it just goes so that's double tap on the left if I double tap on the right it goes next song I don't think I can go triple tap for back 1 two 3 no we just went to next song now not every headphone or earbud has volume on
the buds themselves but these do it's hold to go up takes a while for it to initiate and then it's going in steps now you can see that going up and then hold to go down down now it's going down normally I would say that I want my volume to react a little faster like if someone's walking up to me uh to speak to me and I'm in the gym I like to be able to crank the volume down pretty quickly um so I don't feel the need to pull my earbud out but in this case I think that would be kind of a non-issue
because I should be able to just hear people speaking to me because this is so much more open I would totally wear these in the gym I can lean my head back on a bench without them being touched I can shake my head around without them falling off I feel I can go upside down yeah can totally go upside down and they're IP 54 rated so that means um you know normal earbuds they usually do ipx4 which means they don't get an Engish protection rating for dust but these guys did it's five and then the four is
splashes sweat you know someone could squirt your with water gun you can get caught in the rain it's all fine let's listen to these a little more one thing I want to know is how much people around me can hear any noise that leaks now they claim to have this direct pitch technology which really aims the the sound into the ear holes um but let's see you guys can you can you hear this yet how how loud is it for you you can't I'm getting this all right I'm going to crank this up Beyond a level that I even
want this is Max yeah you can hear it how how loudly would you be mad if I was uh if your desk was there and my desk was here and I was listening of that volume no if we're on the bus together I might be mad on the bus you might be mad so You' be more mad to strangers on the bus than the people work with you listen to this for8 hours without telling me anything but you you can't ride the bus with someone for 5 minutes you're a nice guy okay so it's like any other earphone
when you max it it's going to be a bit annoying to the people around you that's actually pretty decent considering these unlike other headphones these aren't like isolated in your ear canal so all right now though let's listen to something with some bass because with earbuds that go in your ear canal a lot of the base is dependent on you having a seal in your ear canal so you can actually pressurize that volume of air these don't have any seal at all so how can they do base okay there's there's some Bas
present and I believe there's actually a base boost feature in the app I'm going to try that go into here oh boom it's a there's a button exposed right at the highest level okay the base boost definitely makes the Basse feel a little fatter I don't think it makes it sound lower but it it does give it a little more body I would say these graphs come courtesy of headphones.com thank you guys very much and you can see here predictably when you get into like the midrange and the and the sub range it is
below our Target curve which is the dotted line um but it traces it more closely in the treble now with base boost on though it does lift it up around the 100 HZ range it's kind of the crossover Range and then in the mid-range it actually kind of overcooks it but it doesn't seem to affect the treble I probably would keep the base boost on let's see what else they have for the eqs this is boosting the highend to me personally I think I think it's a little bit um becomes a bit bright there
and in this particular sound a little harsh sounding so I probably would just stick to standard of Base boost and then vocal is probably your podcast mode a lot of headphones have a mode that's specifically to make the vocals more intelligible it can be useful if you're listening to like the news or something like that as well but yeah I'd probably stick to these ones on the left now I want to know about how the controls can be changed in the app because they do give you some customization there so it
looks like we have the double tap and press and hold interactions of available to us there's no other single tap or whatever by default or even exposed at all then you can customize what each of those interactions does so on double tap it's telling you what we got by default and then you can select these other kind of configs I think what would I do I might just keep the default voice assistance is okay but I have a watch so yeah I probably keep the default you can pair two devices other than that all we
have in the app is battery life so let's talk about the battery life claims so lots of numbers so I'm just going to have my notes here this is a 40 milliamp hour earbud each B they're over here each one of those 40 milliamp hours uh the case itself is 600 so you can get 28 hours of Music time with the charging case or 6 hours on the buds or 4.3 hours of talk time on the buds I like I love that stat I feel like that's there just for the taxi drivers you can charge up the buds with the case in an hour or you
can just plug them in for 10 minutes to get 2 hours of playback time and the standby time on the these Bad Boys 30 days now we did do some battery life testing ourselves in the lab and we found that our testing was pretty aligned with their claims we didn't quite make it on any of them but we got pretty close on all of them actually the one we got the least close on was the single Bud like battery life time which we measured at 5.3 hours rather than six so there you have it they're pretty cool
they got this little pliable thing that makes it more suitable for more ear types I'm pretty happy with the comfor and I do feel like I could wear these for quite a while cuz they're just so light it's like their air just joking these are on sale now we have links in the description you can get them on Amazon on Best Buy you can actually try these on in person at a Best Buy if you really want to see how they work for you or you can go to the manufacturer's website and buy them directly there they're
$120 they come in black white and pink so thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like hit subscribe hit me up in the comments you can call me names uh I'll I'll still love you I'll be back next time and thanks to shocks for sponsoring this video
