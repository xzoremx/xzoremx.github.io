today I get a unique opportunity to check out a product from a company that Marquez brownley killed that's right we're going to be having a look at the rabbit R1 a product that realistically you already know kind of sucks but what you don't know is how it will uniquely suck for me I've been curious about this thing ever since I heard about it back at CES of this year an AI assistant that I carry around with me but perhaps more useful than the Humane pin and also at a more reasonable price price it's just
$200 and the stick is pretty straightforward it's supposed to be a chat GPT AI enabled device that acts as an intermediary between your voice and your phone allowing you to use voice control even with applications that don't inherently support them the design is delightfully teenage engineering looking which makes sense because teenage engineering designed it maybe should have left it for the adults uh B based on the perception this thing has gotten but hey that's a whole other
conversation it charges via USBC it has "a 1,000 mAh battery in it that's good" for a few hours and takes about 45 minutes to charge although they do claim to be working on this it's got an array microphone up here one button one dial one 360Â° camera and I guess that rotates and a touchcreen let's go ahead and fire it up shall we really nothing else in the Box no charging cable no Wallmart no nothing huh I mean it does come with what it appears is this like a water resistant box or is it just a fancy
looking box it's just fancy looking okay um neat props to the rabbit team by the way forgetting out ah head of the nickname rabbit hole for anyone who carries one of these things around uh the rabbit hole instead is their portal where you manage your relationship with rabbit OS and with the companion device itself rabbit OS by the way it turns out is basically Android and the rabbit it turns out is basically an app that runs on Android as for why it couldn't have just been an app on your phone have they
offered up a statement about that ah system security which kind of makes sense for something that you are giving basically unfettered access to your apps to allow it to do things like book uh travel engagement for you with Uber or order food for you or tweet for you uh it can't tweet for you yet can it I know that's one of the things that they had kind of talked about it being able to do at some point but I guess that was hard all right let's play with it shall we huh wait so this is a touchcreen but
you can't  really and you're running Android so you went out of your way to make it so I couldn't interact with this thing with touch well you can  huh all right we're off to a good start brightness  ergonomic neat I was legitimately kind of excited about this thing when I heard about it I knew it would suck but I was excited about the idea of just being able to sort of Yap at something and essentially have uh you know a standalone Auto hotkey thing that was piped into chat
GPT was kind of how I imagined it and I think that's still kind of the vision that they're selling for it for the future right if only it could connect to the network failed do I have options other than try again I do not try again then I shall ah rabbit OS I don't know how I got to the settings I was I was cleaning it on my shirt oh do you shake it to get to settings that's hilarious it's cute failed why don't we try Ye Old restart you shouldn't have a glossy surface for
a scroll wheel you kind of slip on it a little bit but like that's the least stupid thing about the user interface is it ambidextrous can you like flip it and use it this way if not that would kind of suck oh well sucks to be left-handed I guess wow we've used up like 5% % of battery just trying to connect to the   it okay let's oh God how do I turn it off now oh man oh no all right Network how do I reconfigure it okay Serenity Now I know why they called it rabbit every time you're using it you're like
rabbit I've encountered teenage engineering stuff I've never been compelled to buy any of it because it all just seems really expensive for very limited utility no offense like I want things to do something like this very teenage engineering looks really cool why though you know it's like oh cuz it's cool oh all right okay well let's  connecting oh my god well this is better than not having a keyboard at all are you going to keep you're going to keep showing me how to do okay there it goes
wow that took a minute oh wow it doesn't obscure what you're typing at all there isn't even an option to hide passwords as you enter them fascinating hey we're connected wow Bluetooth what what do you connect to like do you connect to like your earphones or what I mean is it does it connect to your phone via Bluetooth oh yeah do is there an app it just does stuff oh I assumed it would connect to your phone and it would kind of Auto hotkey your phone it just does stuff oh  terrifying oh my god
really that's the maximum speed at which  do not come into my life purporting to be a device that saves me time and then proceed to waste it speaking of things not entirely welcome in my life this is brought to you by dbrand dbrand actually partnered with rabbit ahead of the launch to design cute little screen protectors just for the rabbit R1 and in fact at their launch event they even gave out debrand screen protectors with the units that they gave out at the launch dbrand
also has protectors for all kinds of useful devices like Nintendo game consoles controllers laptops iPads iPhones other pads other phones you can find them at short.com not even that short I mean my trip to Japan I seemed pretty normal height just saying enough fooling around though Bill apparently configured it with all of his personal accounts so uh where should we send him  the ride share status is currently unavailable apologies for the inconvenience please try again later
were you expecting that to work I never tried it never tried it okay well it  for the trick Cal is typically marketed towards children as a fun and colorful breakfast option can you do an image search I can assist with an internet search what would you like me to search for I'd like you to take a picture and then tell me what something is I'm unable to take pictures or provide visual information as the camera function is not currently enabled how else may I assist you today what do you
mean the camera function's not enabled oh my God the camera function's not enabled don't let me once again do not come into my life telling me that you are going to provide natural interaction shortcuts to get things done and you can't even turn on your camera when I ask you to turn on your camera like this is a thing everyone's noticed about this right probably probably yeah I don't know I haven't watched any videos about it I've intentionally cloistered myself on this
one where can I buy this mouse pad let  look this appears to be a decorative wall hanging or art piece not a mouse pad given the the nature of the item I don't believe you would be able to purchase this as a mouse pad where can I buy this mouse pad I apologize but I do not see a mouse or a bed in the image provided the thing in the center of this image is a mouse pad this is not a mouse pad but rather a glass or transparent tabletop with a colorful abstract design on it the design geometric shape many
manufacturers offer a range of sizes features and designs to suit different creative applications you can't tell it to shut up it just talks until it's done who does this thing think it is me on the land show okay fine let's try something wow this camera is not very good um okay who are you looking at right now let me see the image shows a person a man looking straight at the camera he has short light colored hair and is wearing a black T-shirt the background includes some geometric shapes and lighting
elements suggesting this may be a home or Studio setting so it can't search for people good Lord what can it do we're down to 82% battery wow play some super cool music on my Spotify make the ladies think I'm super cool for the music I'm listening to getting the music going now nice is it going to is it going to play music did it just crash double click does not open the camera anymore like I can open oh here maybe it's just quiet maybe it's quiet media let's go no man that's not quiet how much
funding did these guys raise what is even happening right now is it just is it broken okay well here let's reboot it let's reboot it no let's power it off and then wait for it nonsense and then power it back on network connection lost jeez play music that will make the ladies think I am cool okay starting the  now oh it's just broken this did two updates today and it both of them took a long time well that's something it did today you know what the reality of it is I'm sure that there are plenty of
talented designers and Engineers who worked on this product and uh realistically they have got to know that it's not ready yet and so the only reason that I can think of that I'm holding this right now is that the money that's involved is expecting some kind of return and if money wasn't so impatient it would have known that the better thing to do would be to hold on to this for a little bit longer until they've had time to let her cook cuz I do see the potential but I don't see any
of the execution in the version that I'm holding in my hand right now I also see some sort of just generally terrible terrible ideas where they need to get out from inside their own buttholes and understand that you know clicking and sliding and clicking on things with the touchcreen is just common sense and needs to be a thing that you can do but you know overall there's nothing inherently terrible about the idea it's just obviously a complete piece of right now let's just hope that it doesn't
multiply like uh real rabbits just kidding it will man the amount of AI shovelware that's going to be hitting this desk over the next year or two it's going to be a sight to behold it has like three jobs order me an Uber order me door Dash and play music those are the only validated use cases with the bloody thing and it it couldn't do two of them mid journey is the fourth yeah I saw that mid Journey what even would I do what would I do with mid Journey on this thing like look at it on my tiny
little screen I have a phone in my pocket like are you kidding me right now this is my this is my ancient crappy phone and it's that much bigger like you got to be kidding me see people are going to be watching this going like oh that line is what an but like if I told you anything other than what a piece of crap this thing is I would be scamming you I'd be complicit this is my job subscribe to Short Circuit
