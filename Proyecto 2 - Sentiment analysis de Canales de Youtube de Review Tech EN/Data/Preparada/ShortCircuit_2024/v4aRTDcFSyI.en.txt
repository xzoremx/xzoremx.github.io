I am absolutely smitten with the Asus Zen phone 10 it's smallish but it still has Flagship performance great battery life and just a ton of amazing features that Asus has actually added to it which is why when I heard that they were making a Zen phone 11 I was excited until I found out that it was going to be the zenphone 11 Ultra and I found out that they went big mode and alongside the size increase is a pretty radical departure from the two large camera lenses that we uh no and I don't know
love maybe it's gone from their textured plastic back to a kind of smooth glass back which honestly has a decent amount of grip in the hand but nothing compared to this textured plastic back it also still maintains an aluminum frame on the outside though this time it's recycled aluminum because they're going eco-friendly mode which is great we love it uh the phone has ip68 water resistance and on the front has Gorilla Glass victus 2 durable Baby I really liked this Zen Touch button that was
featured on the side of the Zen phone 10 it ended up being your fingerprint reader as well as like you could use it to swipe down notifications and stuff like that it was a multi-purpose button and I really enjoyed that feature and now you have an unders screen fingerprint reader and just a normal lock button which is a little bit of a downer in my opinion hey look at that an included case that's always a nice value ad I love looking at these cases look at the size of the the look at the size for
the camera camera bump there was already a huge camera bump you might notice that there's a crack in my camera lens here because it protrudes so much that it's one of the easiest parts to hit the ground when it falls uh elsewhere in the box we have a charging cable a USB C to C uh and they don't give you a wall plug which is a bummer because it looks like there's space in the Box for it so while it stylistically is a departure from the Zen phone 10 what it isn't very much a
departure from is the Rog phone it's basically the same you can look around you can see that there is the volume rocker the lock button the antenna band the camera bumps the camera layout all the same there are some things that they don't include like the extra USBC port on the side but the bottom you can even see that you got the USBC port and the headphone jack shout out to Asus for keeping a headphone jack I love to see that so basically they took the shell of the r phone and made
it a nicer phone which is okay cuz the r Phone 8 is a great phone I'm a gamer but I don't like it to be like my entire personality so it's nice that you can kind of you know something that's presentable for like the parents or something like that I personally think the r phone looks a little better just cuz it's got it feels a little bit more intentional I think the camera bump placement on this is kind of ugly and alongside that ugly camera bump it also brought a lot of the specs of the RG
phone8 which we'll get into after this message from our sponsor thanks to game Power for sponsoring this video there rapid 360 monitor will have you turning around 360° and looking right back at the Glorious 360 HZ refresh rate and a 1 millisecond response time this 27in monitor features a 90° rotatable 1080p IPS display that supports freesync and g-sync whether you're an elite gamer or an extreme spreadsheet you're sure to appreciate not just the tasteful RGB on the back but also a neat little
projector that can display a custom logo right under your monitor check out the game Power rapid 360 at the link down below the phone ships with with a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 a top-of-the-line processor that's like a massive improvement over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 the Zen phone comes with up to 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage but if you live in the US you only get the option of the 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage finally a win for the non us people that feels pretty good the screen
is a 144 HZ ltpo AMOLED display which means that it can go all the way down to 1 HZ if there's nothing on the screen that requires a rapid refresh rate now speaking of Rapid refresh rate that 144 Herz number is only available in games when you're moving around the UI uh it's just going to be at 120 HZ that high refresh rate screen is also huge 6.7 in but apparently it's only a 1080 screen it's 2400x 1080 I can't really tell but that means it's probably the same resolution as this it looks pretty good
to me I really don't think that there's a reason to have 4 K on your uh phone display uh it's too small it just is you don't need the higher pixel density and if it increases battery life that's great speaking of battery the battery in "this phone is 5,500 milliamp hours which" might not seem that big for this big of a phone but it's just the same size as the one in the r Phone 8 which is a hm who would have thought that that would happen but the Zen phone 10 has a smaller battery and it has killer
battery life and according to the results from the Lambs this thing is a battery King in our longevity test where we watch YouTube at 1080p at a brightness of 250 nits the Zen phone Ultra got 22 hours and 11 minutes of screen on time which is insane in comparison the Google pixel 8 Pro gets just 14 hours and 11 minutes the phone does support 65 wat fast charging which obviously isn't the fastest compared to like the 100 watt Chargers out there still pretty good but they didn't
include a charger in the box so we tested our battery charging with a 30 watt charger and in about half an hour you'll see about 44% of your battery filled up with a 30 W charger which is still pretty good especially if that means that you get around 10 hours of battery life remaining on the phone the time for a full charge was around 75 minutes at 30 WTS so still pretty good let's take a look at the screen and as you can see from the top down camera this is a bright display with the auto
brightness on the screen can go as high as "2,483 nits that will only really happen" outside with the sun shining on it but that's crazy good and makes it really really easy to use outside if you turn the auto brightness off and you just manually set it the max will get is "still a very high 1,000 nits let's" listen to the speakers I mean they're they're pretty  loud that's not bad those are pretty good speakers they definitely do some processing to like make it sound even
louder at the top but with that this kind of makes this like a bit of a media monster if you got this great screen on it plus great speakers now the display might look good but can you take good photos the biggest weakness on the Zen phone 10 is probably its camera system it takes photos and it takes them okay uh I think asus's camera software is a little bit finicky and also they don't really have the great processing that you can find on pixels or Samsung phones however they have upgraded from two
sensors to three so now we have a 13 megap Ultra wide camera a telephoto that comes in at 32 megapixels and a main shooter that comes in at a whopping 50 megapixels but obviously resolution doesn't matter if the phone can't do stuff very well I found it on the Zen phone 10 that the W Ultra wide was far worse of a camera than the main sensor and just taking a quick look in what is pretty gnarly setting I mean just through the viewfinder you can see that the ultra wide does not handle light
nearly as well as that main sensor and in this lighting there's kind of a haze that comes over the telephoto lens is that like I've never really seen that before the telephoto doesn't have a crazy like 10x Zoom or anything like that but in the camera app you can go all the way up for a digital crop to 30 times Zoom um and it looks grainy and in terms of the camera processing a lot of the colors kind of get mushed down and uh things kind of start to look synthetic because you lose a lot of
these details it looks competent and it's like good enough but one thing I know from using my zen phone is that I really would miss the quality that I got when I was using a pixel uh just switching over to the selfie camera we have a 32 megapix front sensor and it um it looks pretty good in this lighting so on top of that there's also a ton of AI features of cuz of course there's AI features cuz it's 2024 and if you don't have an AI feature I mean what are you oh the there's AI smart search for your
photos it's going to use object recognition to search through your photos for you apparently you can also search for apps which again doesn't sound like AI or you can deep and smart search for settings okay the portrait video is an interesting feature basically it's supposed to allow you to have like a depth of field effect where it'll focus on a certain face and then it'll do a processed blur all around it uh they have a six AIS gimbal for your video so you can get really steady
motion and it it works quite well I'm going to make sure that we have it set up here the hyper steady will limit the resolutions that you can record at probably because it's going to be doing some sort of cropping at the edges so that you can get more balance so you aren't able to shoot at the 8K 24 frames per second that the phone is capable of though I don't know why you're taking 8K video it can also do 4K 60 on the video let's see how good it is let's see it's pretty good that's it's pretty stable
let's take a look at the regular video quality which lab specifically said was uh actually quite good we'll just do normal stabilization just from the viewfinder things are actually looking quite good color seem accurate there's not a ton of noise when I look at the darker scenes it seems like the mic is pretty sensitive to noise to like being bumped and stuff though maybe something to note but again it's a competent camera it would be interesting to see if installing gcam
could maybe like give you an extra Edge in terms of photo processing but uh who knows what I know is I want a game on this despite this not being an Rog phone you still get to take advantage of like the game genie features that are on the r Phone 8 which includes stuff like setting frame rate limits or increasing your overall performance like and not worrying about the heat however I think lab saw from testing that if you let this thing go absolutely unhinged it gets really hot and it can be
uncomfortable to hold and honestly apparently the performance holds pretty steady even at like not Full Tilt so you can adjust the refresh rate bunch of other stuff you can do macros uh uh picture and picture if you want a video over top you can speed up the systems optimized now boys we're playing genin impact on high settings and uh it's not quite at the full resolution of the screen but it is definitely good enough and we are seeing a pretty solid 60 FPS even in a busy scene like this Castle town area
and Labs confirms that it plays well uh apparently it runs warmer than the Rog phone in most settings but you still get a pretty consistent near 60 FPS with 58 average frames per second in this specific area of the game on a 30-minute play session the performance mode offered slightly higher frame rates at higher quality settings but the thermal management of the S so would throttle the phone down to about 50% performance and it kind of made things worse so they recommend that you keep it in Dynamic
mode as opposed to going for the performance mode which you can all control through the game genie zero complaints about gaming performance it's just a solid chipset the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is a heck of a chip one thing that I've find very frustrating about their software is that their display settings they have this thing called Splendid like what does any of this mean should my phone be an optimal natural or standard it's useless uh the correct answer is that you want it at natural
and you want to turn it a little bit warmer that's enough of me griping nice things to have on here Wi-Fi 7 as well as they have like a dual band mode that's really sick so you can get a really stable Wi-Fi connection on here they also have Bluetooth 5.4 which means it supports a lot of the upcoming Bluetooth features like Bluetooth low energy audio and the aura cast stuff so great for a you know future proofing the big thing about this phone is that it's nice it's competent it's capable but
outside of its battery life it doesn't really Excel where any large Flagship phones don't the cameras are not as good as the ones that you can find on iPhones or pixels or Galaxy S whatever's the number is at now the software experience is good a big fan of it but is not say as gimmicky or as uh doesn't have the really cool features that pixel can bring another thing is that you get two major OS updates and four years of security updates but that's not really great when competitors are offering a
lot more and the biggest killer feature for me which was the size being so reasonable has um has been gone and now we have like another big phone I guess if this is what Asus needs to do to remain in the market um and Ed and sell more phones I guess it's good because I love a lot of what Asus does with their phones and I love that there's more competition in the space but like it's going to suffer from the same flaws that this phone has and that like I can't find a good case
for this or I cracked this lens and I can't find a replacement part for it and I don't want to have to like send it into Asus to get it fixed I would love to be able to just swap the lens out myself and that's because it's a small volume phone I just worry that this phone no longer has enough differentiation to make it worth buying over a OnePlus or a pixel or an iPhone and the price is $900 which is like pretty high up there I mean this was not a cheap phone either but again that's a very very competitive
territory where you're seeing a lot of the best phones on the market sitting at after using the phone I am less disappointed than I thought I would be but I still feel a little bit of a betrayal for Asus leaving the small phone market I'm hoping that because there's a suffix maybe there will be a Zen phone 11 non-ultra that will be small and not sacrifice too many of the specs but I'm not holding my breath and I'll keep holding on to this Banger of a phone I love you and I love you for watching short
circuit if you liked this video uh why don't you check out Mr Jake bance's video on the Zen phone 10
