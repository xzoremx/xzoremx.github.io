under normal circumstances I wouldn't be that excited to do a sponsored phone unboxing but the red magic 99 Pro is the first device that I've gotten my hands on with the new Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and this thing looks sick Qualcomm is claiming up to 30% better performance up to 20% better efficiency a 25% faster GPU not to mention that red Magic's implementation comes with virginity armor WoW I'm never going to lose it  way anime is cool no judgment seriously though red magic is claiming that this
is the fastest chip to ever do it and the phone itself is loaded up with features first let's take a look at the accessory package we've got an included type-c to type-c USB cable as well as wow imagine that a charger in the box and not just any charger this is an 80 W charger that we found took the phone from Zer to full in just 40 minutes which is all the more impressive when you wow this paper is not coming off there we go it's glossy black which is all the more impressive when you
consider that the phone itself has a 6500 Milah battery oh wow I thought this was a sticker but it's not between phones with cool lighting and ones with transparent backs like this I am liking this trend why have a boring black slab when you can have a cool black slab oh there's another color way they sent us let's guess snowfall oh okay white hey that's not just white though that's that looks pretty cool and also includes armor anything in here Sim removal tool and documentation cool we're looking at
a 50 megapixel another 50 and that is not a camera that is a cooling fan which we'll take a look at in a moment the third one is a 2 megapixel shooter right here which it's going to be a macro shooter maybe I don't know they don't mention it so we'll figure that out first let's get this thing fired up and talk about why it matters that these C cameras are flush I think most people are kind of used to the camera bump at this point so why do they care and the answer is because while it doesn't
matter for holding your phone like this it matters a lot for holding your phone like this and these are gaming forward phones so if you got a camera bump digging into your knuckle and you're sitting there using it for 2 3 4 hours at a time it's going to be pretty annoying comes with a built-in screen protector always love to see it thank you for not nickel and diming me let's talk basic specs for a moment it's running red magic OS 9 which is based on Android 14 and has either 12 or 16 gigs
of lpddr 5x memory with 256 or 512 gigs of storage did I mention that that fan is RGB oh my God it's got four separate LEDs it looks like let's crack open mobile Forge ah here we go competitive atmosphere LED wa okay there's an LED here let's make that one perfect purple nice they say it spins at up to "22,000 RPM which might be kind of" annoying if you don't have headphones in uh the good news is why don't we take a quick tour of the outside of the device you got your dual SIM slots dual nano
SIM USBC stereo side firing speaker there's your game mode toggle oo haptic trigger buttons lock button volume rocker these have a 520 HZ pulling rate and feature custom lighting then moving up to to the top a 3 and 1/ 12 mm headphone jack let's go another side firing speaker there's one of your microphones and another vent for the fan so this is pulling air in the one side and Blasting it out the other this must do some real Cooling in here and it does we've got results for it firing Up 3D
mark whoa you can immediately hear the fan kicking a lot less annoying than I thought it was going to be of course it's probably not running at full speed right now let's do uh Wildlife extreme stress test we already ran this but I'm just experiencing it for myself for the first time man it's crazy what you can do on a mobile chipset these days is that as loud as it gets okay well that's not bad especially when you consider here let's have a look at our historic results this is the worst we got it to
do this isn't it stock configuration without either of the clip-on coolers and over a 20 minute stress test we only reached about 60Â° by the end of it and that is some really really strong result stability too at around just shy of 94% of the score after 20 minutes of what we had on our first Loop what that means essentially is if you start at 30 frames per second you're going to end up at around 28.6 frames per second after a 20-minute gaming session that's pretty good now I
mentioned some clip-on accessories huh here's the clamp on one you got a little button to turn it on uh USBC port for power oh I guess uh doesn't have its own battery so you got to power with the phone here we go one sec and it's a little weird to me that you would have an insulating rubberized layer I mean I guess you don't want it to move around but no it's thermoconductive silicone wow that definitely increases the weight a little bit oh I bet it comes with a little short cable no it comes with a
long cable overall things have been going really well up until now how about a shorter USBC cable with the clip on that RGB though okay that's uh that's something the button is apparently not to power it on and off it just goes it's to change the gear so it can either go in high gear or eco mode and then if you hold it it changes the RGB style speaking of cooling their ice 13.0 magic cooling system apparently features a "10,182 MM squared Vapor chamber which is" a lot less than it sounds like that's
only 100 square cm which is 10x 10 but that's still a lot of surface NE to pack into all the little structures inside their Vapor chamber with this bad boy we were able to achieve 96.3% frame rate stability which is not as good as the magnetic one that's wait a second does this have a pelta in it oh that's chilly interesting as a first party accessory all right sure oh cool I don't have to have a big stupid clamp on it the so is kind of up here so let's go ahead and o no no no no Oh no I got this
no debrand be watching this L yeah lus this is why we never let you put on our skins okay I probably wouldn't put it there even if that does give me the best performance and it really does we saw greater than 99% performance stability with this particular cooler on it coming back to gamespace there's a lot to explore here they've got different performance profiles depending on whether you prioritize battery life or performance they've optimized their plug-in life Library had Crosshair stopwatches cool
stuff like that and they've revamped Mora she's their AI digital assistant and maybe this is the kind of thing that plays better in other markets that's probably enough of Mora for me my wife watches these she doesn't but look the people who are in tomora you guys you know you saw that you're like oh that looks great and you got you guys go for it but I it's uh let's talk about the display a red magic claims a better Peak brightness than they ever have before and that much is true but we were not
"able to attain the 1,600 nits that they" claim we're not quite sure how they measured that we were able to hit just "over 1,00 nits which is plenty for" watching content in HDR but isn't what they said so we'd like to see that improved what was what they said was the battery life we measured over 23 hours in our endurance test playing back a YouTube video at a fixed brightness and about an hour 45 under under extreme load pretty darn impressive I like the aspect ratio it's 2480 X 1116 so it's a
little bit on the taller side really responsive 960 HZ pulling rate on the screen you can really feel it that's not  hey not bad Distortion sets in around 80% that's as high as I would go but this thing is flipping loud at 80% get you some real stink eye on the bus loud at 80% so don't do that just use the headphone jack there's more to like about the screen I didn't even mention it 6.8 in 120 HZ AMOLED but where's the camera hole punch that's right my friends they are boasting a
93.7% screen to body ratio with an under screen front-facing camera and there it is huh that's pretty good there no no we  there you can kind of see a shadow of it that's pretty cool okay now let's see how it holds up yeah it is uh not the best selfie  used it takes a lot of processing on this boy to make it work but if you are not that into selfies which a lot of people aren't and you prioritize a completely seamless screen experience this is it and it's there in case of a
selfie emergency I guess and this has a particular impact for gamers because whole punch cameras tend to not have touch sensitivity over top of them meaning sometimes you can have to rearrange your inputs not going to be a problem here at least the rear camera is markedly better very functional this is the first phone that has made us go man we need to re-evaluate our mobile game benchmarking cuz most mobile apps are FPS locked so they can't go higher than whatever their target is 60 120 FPS
dolphin used to be just like an insane stress test for phones but this thing hit 1% loaves of 58 frames per second like we're not going to be able to differentiate between Snapdragon 8 gen 3 devices or at least barely what what are we going to do Yuzu oh well that's going to be harder we've got one more accessory to play around with the Shadow Blade 2 it's got hall effect sticks and triggers which I was not expecting actually surprisingly nice ergonomics different joysticks depending
on whether you like them small or you like them grippy or okay that's pretty cool joystick swaps are handled by just popping off these magnetic tops it's apparently compatible not only with red magic phones but basically any phone you like as long as it's got USBC and oh it turns your USBC Jack into a USBC charger charging port and a headphone jack that was immediately detected love to see it oh man PlayStation portal look out as long as you've got like $800 to spend for the top skew although to their
credit at least pricing hasn't gone up since last gen which seems to be something we can't really take for granted anymore these days and it starts at 650 for the 12 gig uh 256 gig version M it's not compatible with the extra cooler with the game pad on though let fire up dolphin man I like this thing feels surprisingly good got rip at the back L4 R4 even the d-pad doesn't suck I'm not the biggest fan of the position of it but it doesn't suck all right how do I use items all right that'll do 
it's not a skill issue it's it's a settings issue Superstar hacks let's go well that was the end of the race okay well let's uh ignore that and uh subscribe to Short Circuit see you later
