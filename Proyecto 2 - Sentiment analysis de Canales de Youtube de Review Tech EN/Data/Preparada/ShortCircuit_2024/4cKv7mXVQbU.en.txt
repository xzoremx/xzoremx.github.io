with the buds 3 Pro Samsung has radically changed the design of the earbuds from being stemless which just kind of sat in the folder re ear to essentially the airpods or airpods Pro Design with a stem but is this a good decision lots to talk about here wow they uh they went full cyber truck with these ones very angular very steel looking I would say very cool you see that light that just turned on and thankfully the case does not have this weird soft touch that the buds 2 Pros
had like look it you can actually see it peeling off there and the parts that aren't peeled off they feel like it's a deteriorating plastic like it's going to come off on my finger or something or I could scratch it off yeah it's so easily scratched this does not have longevity and you know long live the king the king is dead this one in the box we have this little case this little piece of paper we have a USB C Toc cable that is this long looks like it's like 3 ft does
not come with an adapter in the Box for charging I recommend getting outlets on the wall that have USBC on them nothing worse than going to charge your phone and there's just the it's the brick is gone why kind of a fit guide and a quick start guide and that's all well and good but I want to look at the industrial design of these things it's interesting because as the largest brand on the Android side Samsung really can you know set Trends and be like the apple of Android or they could just be the apple
of Android and copy what Apple does H I like to hope that the reason they went for this stem design was for a practical engineering reason I like to hope that it's because putting the microphone close ever so slightly closer to your mouth and pointing it in orientation to pick up sounds from your mouth was going to give them higher mic quality than they could previously achieve on these ones that just do not have a stem at all and if that's the case you know they could just be acknowledging Apple kind
of nailed it they did it right with this design it is better to have the stem for that reason for an engineering purpose or they could have just gone hey people like airpods but you have an Android phone so uh just buy our airpods I guess either either approach is valid you can see that for the cases themselves they also pretty much copied the airpods you got a single light here you got the charging ports on the bottom you have the a pairing button Samsung put theirs on the bottom you've got the
hinges like look at the that really does look similar the case for the Samsungs is larger and has a clear top whether you get this in white or cyber truck steel looking gray the case is clear on the top I don't know how durable that's going to be it might get scuffed and scratched up even your pocket with keys or coins um but right now out of the box it looks slick the other cool thing about this case is that it has flat areas so it it can stand it can stand any which way you've got left and right indicator
on the front here as well as on the bottom of the stem orange for the right side blue for the left side the buds themselves they've differentiated themselves at least visually from the airpods in that they're angular pretty cool there's a slight Ridge along the top of this to give it some kind of Dimension there's also a legend indicating this is the left one there's an L there seems to be printed on and not like embossed or anything I can't feel any texture to that little r you've
got a vent on the top some holes for microphones these silicone ear tips have caused some people some problems let's see that's what it looks like inverted and if I pop it off of there ooh it's some resistance oh my gosh this is actually not squishy this looks non-standard compared to let's say the tips that come with the cmf buds that I just looked at this is rigid and fits around this driver and Pops back on there okay on to line it up and goes easily and I believe some other media who have received these
uh have ripped these ear tips while while trying to pull them off that may be the cause of a delay in shipping of these two retailers fitting them into the case there appears to be some magnet action very satisfying case sound is good the the tactile feel it really feels like it clicks open and I didn't mention the LED light that goes along the length of this thinnest Edge that is pretty cool and potentially useful if you're trying to find these things if you drop drop them in the couch or
something like that on top of the other feature of it just beeping when you're looking for them which many earphones have I want to hear how they sound and share some performance graphs right away so let's get these paired they do come with multiple ear tips small and large separately here but I feel like the medium's good for me this content's not authorized the is that damn this song was too hot for TV oh yeah these sound good these sound good let's turn them up oh how loud do they go that's plenty
loud they're getting a little sient up here they're in the ears though they sound pretty good they sound pretty natural although they're a little thumpy in the base and that is also exactly what we saw in the labs testing you can see that the green curve follows our dotted Target curve pretty closely from the mids up through the treble but in the base it's a little overcooked however I would say that that's actually probably the smartest move that Samsung can make a lot of
people prefer a little extra Bas and you can just EQ this out if you if you want it to sound even more natural they sound exciting and and Punchy um one thing to note though is they do not have volume dependent EQ which means that when you turn the volume down they do not turn the Basse up which lots of earphones do because our human hearing is less sensitive to base at lower volumes these just they keep it raw baby we also have some measurements for the active noise cancelling performance on this graph you
can see the white line is if you're just not wearing the headphones at all the green line is the isolation get from just putting them in your ears passive isolation and the red line is if you turn active noise cancelling on so you "can see from 800 to 5,000 khz there's" not a lot of change between ANC on and passive isolation but lower down you get a lot more of an effect from the active noise cancelling next I'm going to test out the swiping controls and the pinch controls on the stem as well as doing a
mic test right after this message from our sponsor motion gray their sitto stand desk coming a wide variety of models and sizes with easy to follow instructions and all the tools you need for assembly included right in the Box check out the Ergo 2 series one of the most affordable desks of its type on the market with a two segment frame and a quiet but powerful single motor it has a height adjustment range of 28 to 46 in and supports up to 176 lb of weight that's 80 kg for those of you who use
the good system pick one up using our Link in the description and use code Linus for 10% off your purchase there's a capacitive swipe along the length of the stem but then in a shorter segment of the stem near the bottom you can actually do a tactile like pinch so let's see how well that works okay this interface takes some getting used to it's like you're trying to imagine you're trying to like pick up a pyramid like it's really sticky it's like that Parton kungpow and they have the pyramid
nipples nobody's seen that to make the button press happen with with a pinch you actually have to pinch both fingers on either side of the triangle and kind of pinch the tip of the blade so it actually feels kind of weird because of the shape of it it's like your fingers are slipping off of it as you pinch it works you can see the icon right here as I squeeze and there is a little sound that accompanies The Squeeze it's like a little tick tick then for the swipe you have to pick the right edge of the blade
to swipe on not the front but the back which I find swiping with my thumb is the best it's great that you can actually adjust the volume of these earphones which you can't always on both up and down symmetrically very cool but you do have to swipe a long basically the whole length of it if you just swipe at the bottom it doesn't work you've got to kind of do a full body swipe is it not working cuz it's out of my ear yes it is so it detects this is capacitive up here too and it'll
actually detect if it's in your head or not let's do a quick mic test and after that we'll look at some of the customizability in the app all right this is the sound of the onboard microphones my phone is way over there so you know it's coming through them and just you know what I'll take a moment to talk about the Ingress Protection ip57 that's pretty awesome that's the second highest level of dust Ingress Protection but more importantly water out of seven these can go underwater up to a meter
which 3 ft for 30 minutes I am wearing these in the shower here we are in the app and you can see there's different settings for different noise cancelling there's off there's Ambient sound where you hear what's around you including your own voice there's active noise cancelling and then there's this Co tool one in the middle which is adaptive where it will actually crank up and down the active noise cancelling according to your environment so if you're in acquired environment it turns it down to
reduce that feeling of pressure in your ears but if you walk by construction site it'll turn it back on or if you get into a car or something like that there's also Auto switching which has its own settings including turn on ambient mode when it detects you speaking or when it detects a siren going by although you know what Sirens are pretty freaking loud so I kind of want the opposite of this feature not a lot of options for media controls when you click into this menu it actually
doesn't give you any options it just tells you what it does which is one pinch for playing pause two for next three for back and a swipe up and down for volume you can actually turn it off completely which is nice the one thing you can customize is what pinching and holding does on left or right you can basically cycle through the active noise cancelling settings or go to your your assistant Bixby and then you can toggle on and off whether pinching and pinching and hold answers and declines calls
there's also because there's these cool light bars on the blades or stems controls for that so when they're out of the case and not in your ears and you pinch and hold you will get battery meter okay that's just white does that mean that it's like halfway and what does this mean blinking fade in Fade Out I don't know when it does these things but it's cool there's options trial and error guys stand in a mirror and mess with it next stretch remers what the hell is that if you hunch over your
phone or desk your head tends to lean forward which can cause back and neck health issues your earbuds can detect your head position and notify you when you bent your head forward for 10 minutes this actually might save our planet this is kind of sick oh God it wants me to calibrate it Jesus look  level we did it okay I couldn't actually find how to get to this menu but using the search function I typed in equalizer and here we are I'm actually quite happy with how many knobs they give you what
is that nine they have some presets this clear one that cranks the base down a bit might be the outof The boox Equalizer that gets you closest to neutral but and look and this toggle that's already on by default is adjust the sound automatically to deliver the best audio based on your ear shape and how you're wearing your buds works best when both your buds are in your ears with a consistent fit I will say when I was doing the adjustments and testing this interface they kind of popped out
real easy so I actually might want to go into the larger silicone tips to get a real tight seal now for battery life claims the milliamp hour capacity of this case is 515 the buds is 53 how long will that actually last you with A and C off 7 hours on the buds 30 hours all told with it on 6 hours on the buds 26 hours including everything and that actually is an improvement from last year where these things only lasted about 5 hours in your ears withc on so an extra hour definitely appreciated one
thing that is unchanged from last last time around is that the multi-point connectivity where you seamlessly can go from your phone to your other device is only for Samsung you can go from your Samsung phone or pad or Dex or whatever very seamlessly but if you're going from your phone to your Windows laptop or your MacBook or something like that no such luck they're trying to lock you in with their ecosystem I don't like that stuff that's baloney it should just work with
everybody but I see what you're trying to do there Android Apple for the price they are $250 which is the same as the airpods pro um but cheaper than some devices you might see from Sony or maybe Bose I think it is a reasonable price the build quality is really great the sound is very good and neutral um if you want to pay less 180 bucks for the non-pro variant but do note that they're a little different they're not in ear like this they're more like airpods where they kind of sit on the outside U
which you may pref prefer but I don't have that in front of me so I don't know guys it seems like there's a good reason to have the stem no knock against it of course more competition and more diversity of designs in are Universe seems like a good thing but if it works it works let us know in the comments what you think on this is this a cop out so thanks for watching guys if you like this video you want to check out some other stuff from Samsung Adam was looking at their new watch go take a look
