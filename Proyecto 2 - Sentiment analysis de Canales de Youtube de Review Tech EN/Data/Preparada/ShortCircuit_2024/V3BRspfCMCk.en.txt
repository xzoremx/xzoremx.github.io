have you ever thought to yourself hm you know what I need a phone that has a "display that can go up to 4,500 nits is" loaded up with AI has up to five flipping cameras on it can airdrop files to my iPhone carrying friends and you know what for good measure I'd like it to have an IR blaster so I can use it as a universal remote well guess what my friends the find X8 and find X8 Pro have all of those things this video is sponsored by Oppo and we're going to be taking a look at them first and foremost
both are loaded up with mediat Tech's new dimensity 9400 chipset meaning that even though one is pro and one is not both actually were found to have very similar performance when we ran them through our Labs testing but before we get to that let's do a quick unboxing and have a look at what's included whoa no way an actual charging brick what were they thinking nobody does that anymore not only that but in 240 volt regions these included Chargers will do up to 80 WT wired charging with
these phones and over Wireless they're rated at what was it up to 50 Watts that is flipping wild oh they also include a USBC cable but on the subject of USBC that is the first big difference between the non-pro and the pro the non-pro uses USB for slower file transfers while the pro uses USB 3.2 for much faster wired file transfers the last unboxing bits are oh look at that they include a case there we go both include cases though in different colors and as you  I'm trying to think if there's a device
that the shape of the non-pro reminds me of why don't we use this opportunity to have a look at one of their highlighted features which is the ability to airdrop files to your iPhone owning friends totally um unrelated thing to bring that out right now while we discuss the shape of this phone though uh okay let's go ahead and give it a shot to do so we just use a familiar gesture to bring down the quick settings and then go ahead and click share with iPhone I guess I need an
app now oh let's take a quick picture how about a selfie cool we got o connect okay share with iPhone one device connected hey all right well took a couple of attempts but we did manage to get the file downloaded and look at that in glorious full quality oh I guess now Z as good a time as any to talk about the cameras you either get three rear cameras on the non-pro or four rear cameras on the pro and I'm going to have to pull up my notes here because I'm going to have a hard time remembering
how many megapixels they all are so they're let's see 50 megapixels 50 megapixels 50 megapixels 50 50 50 and 50 in all seriousness I do need my notes but it's for the focal lengths and features so on the non-pro we've got a 24 mm wide that one has Optical image stabilization then we've got a 73 mm telephoto that has 3x optical zoom and Optical image stabilization and we've also got a 15 mm 120° Ultra wide moving over to the pro we get a 23 mm wide with Optical image stabilization a 73mm periscope telephoto
with 3x optical zoom a 135 mm Periscope telephoto with Optical image stabilization and 6X optical zoom and finally a 15 mm 120° ultrawide both of them as you would expect for a modern device are getting software and AI image enhancement and both of them have a 32 megapixel front-facing selfie camera all right let's try out the camera shall I love this shot in the studio here it's a very challenging condition cuz we've got the studio lights firing right into the lenses but it happens a lot because I
don't know what it is but you ask someone to take a picture for you you're out hiking or whatever it's like they go out of their way to have some kind of light source go right into the lens pretty Sharp actually not bad and surprisingly they're not over juicing the contrast and saturation I want to play around with the telephoto so let's take some more pictures of our producer Bell oh yeah look at him over there there's a little bit more detail on the pro little bit more
resolution both really solid though of course the pro has even more in the tank let's go ahead and take a 6X okay can we get even more detail out of the 6X wow look at that you can almost make out some of the markings on the not actually a component actually a dbrand skin here look at the texture of your jeans B look at this I mean okay in all seriousness though yeah it actually looks really good last thing selfie I'm expecting these to be very similar but there's no doubt in my mind that the
camera is a little bit better on the pro  that's a lot of that's actually a lot of detail on a selfie camera I don't see any kind of measurable difference here though which makes sense they are both spec the same hey I wonder what we can do with the AI editor let's see I can remove Reflections I can unblur I can AI eraser and I can enhance Clarity let's try to take a bad picture I just got to quick launch the camera so now is as good a time as any to show you guys the
quick button on the pro model is it just a button it's just a button it just felt like a squeeze okay it's totally just a button anyway you double tap it to launch the camera okay I'm going to try to take a bad selfie with some weird guy behind me okay now I just need to get rid of this guy smart lasso okay get the heck out of my picture compare uh you know what actually not stupid now let's change gears and talk about the screens Oppo says that these panels are capable
of hitting up to 4500 nits then we hit about 800 nits Peak brightness in SDR mode on both devices about a th000 in HDR in the balanced performance profile "and anywhere from around 1,600 to 1,800" depending on the window size in high performance mode with auto brightness enabled on both of these phones so those are perfectly acceptable modern HDR results even if they're uh 45 00 nits is more to do with maybe the peak capabilities of this panel under isolated circumstances and less to do
with what you'll actually see on this phone I'd like to see them just not talk about that at all to be perfectly honest with you let's look at what some HDR content looks like on it shall we okay there we go yep that's that's HDR all right can confirm curiously we found that hdr on both of the phones performed lower than we would expect with auto brightness enabled and in their balanced performance profile so until Oppo is issues a fix for that we would probably recommend running the phone in the
higher performance mode shall we listen   speaker pretty okay pretty loud uh definitely some Distortion toward the top end after about 70% volume let's try  also has an amplified Earp speaker for stereo sound very similar result maybe a touch worse oh on the subject of hitting the volume rocker we never really did like a physical tour of these things so both of them have that IR Blaster up on the top man I needed an IR blaster so bad the other day like so bad the remote was
missing for something and I had to change something and it was like actually a disaster and because I've switched the iPhone in my old Samsung doesn't have an IR blaster it like really sucked anyway that's a cool feature to have that time that you needed or if it's part of your flow on the right we've got our lock button as well as our volume rocker and then on the pro model the quick button which felt like a squeeze button has really nice htics but it turns out is just a
button other side love this alert slider the ability with a quick slide to change from Silent to vibrate to ring is oh so nice to have they've both got that a good time to talk about charging in our testing both phones charged up in an hour and both lasted for about 19 hours in spite of the PR's larger battery so it looks like that larger battery is pretty much just going towards the slightly larger display let's try critical Ops oh boy that is quite the download I guess now is as good a time
as any to say it has Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7 though and once we get our game actually launched it has a 120 HZ display for more fluid visuals I got to say man mediatech has come a long way the fact that we're not is saying oh yeah well it's got a Media Tech chip set so forget about it is pretty impressive like these are not the highest benchmark scores we've ever seen but they are completely fine I can't do this I'm going to get him no what come on how did that not hit coming back to both phones
there's a few things I haven't talked about yet they're both ip69 ip68 dust and water resistant they both apparently have had a lot of work done on their antenna arrays as well as software to ensure that they get the best possible data reception and they both are available in a variety of colorways with up to 1 terabyte of storage it's not going to come cheap even the 512 gig version when we convert from Indonesian rupia which is the only pricing we have "uh ends up at around 1,000 and around"
$1250 but hey if you want a lot of storage on your phone I guess that's the way to do it now that micro SD slots are out of fashion overall they both pack a surprising amount of performance and features into a relatively comp Compact and lightweight package and while color OSS would have been a downside way back in the day one of the things we do for short circuit is we'll search like this thing controversy to see kind of what the community is saying and color OSS has grown extremely well regarded over
the last little while and they're both shipping with color OS 15 so if you guys want to check these out hey thanks to Oppo for sponsoring this video and we'll have these linked down below subscribe to Short Circuit
