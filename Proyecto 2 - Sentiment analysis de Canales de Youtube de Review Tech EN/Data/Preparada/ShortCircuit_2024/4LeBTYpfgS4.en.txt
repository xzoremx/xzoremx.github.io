it's been a while since I looked at a keyboard with enough RGB to fill my soul with goodness and light and angry meow is kind of promising to do that today with their am neon 80 because it's a synthwave reminiscent keyboard that is supposed to be filled with holes that's "right holes they've drilled over 3,000" holes into this thing and I'm really excited about it because about 3 years ago to the very day I opened the cyberboard R3 and I love it I don't care what you guys say I love that keyboard
and so we're going to look at this one today just out of the box we got our keyboard here I'll unveil it in a moment and then we've got some leaf springs because in true am fashion they've kind of move to using leaf springs as their main mounting system and while I'm not crazy about it because I don't Tinker too much once I've got my keyboard finished this lets you do that it's got apparently 12 total different stages that you can set it to cable I don't normally comment on how smooth and soft
the cable feels people are complaining because it's an expensive keyboard we'll talk about price later and at the price point you don't get the nice coiled cable that's a fair complaint I'll be honest though this is it's just really soft and smooth and feels good to touch it's not super long this is probably like a 3ft cable so that's a little disappointing I would like to see a longer one but it's USBC to see one really nice thing though is it is labeled as a 100 wat cable love to see
it because people often don't label their USBC cables and then you get the cable and you plug it in and it's not charging right because it's not sorry and something else I just found out it's magnetic and in true angry meow fashion this whole thing comes in this beautiful case that is a little overbuilt but you know what the keyboard's very expensive so I get why they put it in such a nice case what's really cool is that on the bottom of the briefcase esque box we've got a bunch of
specs and stats for our keyboard it's mostly our model number voltage stuff like that it's uh wired only for reasons we'll get to in a moment but this thing can allegedly draw up to 12 Watts because of all the LEDs that are installed and then we've also got in this little bag here it looks like it's just a spare piece of foam for one of the many foam layers that are I that I am sure are inside this keyboard today that we're going to check out I'm going to keep this handy in case I need it
because you never know the  heavy oh my gosh it's been a while since  desk this is absolutely stunning it is just a giant thick sheet of aluminum and oh my gosh I I love it on the bottom uh we've got what looks to be oh my God it's three peels two three we've got the classic angry meow catpaw logo there's a ton of holes in this bad boy so if you got Trypophobia I would just turn away right now cuz you're going to get Eed out but I love it and apparently there's a bunch of RGB they've got over
300 LEDs uh below the surface here to light up this whole keyboard on the top on the front on the sides and on the switches hence the clear key caps they're calling it four dimensional cuz there's four dimensions of lighting I don't know about that but you know what sure it's great I really like the type feel these are icy silver Pro V2 switches they look and sound pretty good that is creamy not much rattle if any in the space bar oh same with the shift enter it's all good don't get me wrong you
might be paying a lot of money but the quality is there is it worth that much I don't know that's for you to judge but I will say it feels solid you're not going to get this thing and then feel completely ripped off it's so hard to lift up partly because you can't really get your fingers underneath it because the rubber feet are very thin and then on the back here we've got this indentation it looks like they're wireless charging stuff but there's no battery in here so I don't know if the
"plan was to fit a couple of 5,000" milliamp hour batteries and then they just said nope it doesn't have enough juice because apparently it doesn't it's just too much light too much RGB it's  "just put holes in it easy peasy 3,000 of" them it's actually really difficult to machine them out but they've done it those mad Lads USBC in the middle some of you care some of you care about the left side or the right side I'm a middle kind of guy personally so this actually suits me pretty well comes in three
different colors cyber gray space silver and Cloud white looks like we've got our cyber silver it's so shiny it's very Apple do you think it's Apple just okay yeah it does look like the finish on your MacBook bring your MacBook over here this one's darker it's better I like mine more and one of the best parts is if you don't like these switches for whatever reason I actually really like them so far I do believe this is hot swap even though I didn't see it mentioned like anywhere I found one
review yep no problem easy peasy oh these are so pretty just crystal clear it does also come in a little bit cheaper DIY version that you'll have to put together yourself so if you want to buy that one go ahead I want to play plug this thing in though I got to see the RGB it's so shiny like I can't wait to see the just explosion of color apparently uh you need a motherboard with a USB 3 port and I guess USBC like it's kind like it's it's giving you a ctoc cable instead of the typical c a
cable uh and I mean it's delivering 100 Watts because this thing is going to eat through that power and they actually have a little bit of warning on about how you need a good enough power supply for it 12 Watts it's fine you're not going to you know you could probably run this on whatever but you are going to need a motherboard with USB 3 but before I turn it on you know let's take a minute to talk about our sponsor Corsair their 3500x midtower PC case is a great choice for just about any build with
support from Mini ITX all the way up to eatx motherboards a wraparound tempered glass aesthetic and room for up to 10 120 mm fans your PC will stay cool both inside and out plus its removable glass panels make building and upgrading a breeze it even supports reverse connections for a clean cable-free look so check out the Corsair 3500x at the link in the video description all right now we've got everything set up let's  in you can customize it of course so we put short circuit on there and oh my
gosh it's so pretty and then let me see what else we can do F10 turns it onor off that's pretty cool F9 turns my RGB honor off for my keys that's why you got them sweet sweet clear uh key caps oh and then you've got a bunch of modes so you can just change like full colors all the modes oh oh oh let's hit the lights let's hit the lights wow I don't want to pay for it but I want this thing oh and I haven't even looked at the side yet oh my God or the front wow I man I love this thing but
how does it how does it type I I say it feels good but you know oh wow they got their am neon 80 software just ready to go here it supports qmk vile and their own software layer 1 layer two layer three layer four that's pretty cool seems easy enough to do ooh lighting effects Library oh that's cool you got a bunch of presets that you can change it to and yeah like uh kind of like the uh cyberboard you can change this Matrix to whatever you want um so you can make your own custom pattern patterns and
like you like I mean you saw the short circuit logo and the LTT logo um you can do whatever you want and if this isn't enough for you you can download other Json files that other people have uploaded for their own lighting effects uh so you can share if you want you know so you make something really cool you want to give it to your friend or just the community you can do that I'm not going to do that the angle is a little less Steep and I kind of like it it's it's much flatter and uh it's a bit more
pleasant to type on some people like a really high angle I'm like okay with it I don't hate it but this is preferable to to me let's go sounds so good 11298 you know what oh it feels and sounds just so good that space bar is just that nice little extra kind of deep sound to it as you just jump through the words man can I just take this back with me I have three other keyboards on my desk I will swap all of them for this guy and the a cool thing is as well is it's really easy to take apart came with these
little Hex wrenches for you so if you do want to Tinker you can just go ahead and pop those out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight screws that's not too bad my real complaint is only the cable I I know it's 100 watt and the more bandwidth or power you try to push through cables the shorter they've got to be before they start losing signal strength and I get it I just really wish that it was a bit longer cuz uh it's really short honestly other wise I think the only thing to complain about is the price if you want
the base kit because you already have a bunch of other stuff you've got switches  $516 that's a lot if you want more if you want it to come fully decked out kind of like we got right here you're looking at  personally I I can't say I would buy it it's so tough like I want to uh but I can't and that's so disappointing cuz it's it's incredibly beautiful but what do you think you think it's worth it you think it's not let us know in the comments below and Shout at me and tell me why I don't
need the am neon 80 this synthwave awesome keyboard that I so desperately want to steal thanks for watching Short Circuit this is a big keyboard goodbye
