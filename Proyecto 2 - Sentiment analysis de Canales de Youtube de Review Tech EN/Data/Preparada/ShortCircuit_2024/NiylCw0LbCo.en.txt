this guy this guy Belle he's a Mac User and he was like what Windows laptop is good and I said the Acer Swift X he literally scoffed these Apple guys that hear Acer they no this thing's great and I'm going to show you why it it also isn't great in some ways but but it's great and I'm going to tell you why all right here we have a 100 wat power adapter and that is being delivered over USB type-c which is awesome I absolutely love that you can have everything from your headphones to
your vape pen to your Xbox controller all of them can be charged directly from this plug it in hit the power button got it damn it there we go it's a laptop it certainly looks like a laptop there's not much design going on the back there this would be a really good candidate for a dbrand skin cuz man that's that's not a whole lot happening there overall though we do have a solid selection of I/O so on the right we have Micro SD and a fulls size type A on the left we have two Thunderbolt 4S
headphone microphone combo Jack another type A and HDMI 2.1 looking around the back one thing that is interesting is that there doesn't appear to be much for ventilation back here it's just metal and there's a tiny little vent on the bottom that might not be enough to cool the 4070 in here actually I know it's not enough I looked at the laps results the build quality does seem quite high this is a stamped aluminum chassis and it is really really quite rigid overall though first impressions are quite good
this trackpad takes up the full bottom here it has their eco-friendly ocean glass either way glass topped touchpad like to see that we've got the keyboard here nice easy layout and we've also got this segue to our sponsor secret lab you may know them for their best-in-class gaming chairs but did you know secret lab makes desks too their Magnus Pro isn't your average sit to stand desk either it is packed with unique features you can have the cleanest desk around with their patent pending integrated
power supply column and a ful length built-in Cable Management tray and of course the Magnus Pro is fully adjustable as a sit-to stand desk with a Sleek integrated control panel check out the Magnus Pro and all of secret lab's offerings at the link down below all right quickly let's give this away 3.4 lb that is pretty good with our charger that goes up to 4.2 not too bad especially given this has a 47 in it all right let's have a look at the spe in here we have an Intel Core Ultra 71 155h
that is 16 cores 22 threads we also have "32 GB of memory running at 6,400 megat" transfers per second it does say row of chips so he might not be able to upgrade it which would be a big sad we also have a 1 TB Samsung nvme SSD Wi-Fi 6E and the star of the show and the star of not the show actually the Nvidia RTX 470 this thing is an excellent GPU that is very much held back by the fact this only has an advertised 50 wats of power and a measured 60 is we actually saw 58 which
is um not enough for these we will talk about the actual performance later but 60 wats is not enough for a 4070 and you don't even have the like in some laptops you can be like yeah just get the more expensive GPU even if it doesn't have enough power it has more vram nope this is 8 GB of GPU memory so that's not really enough oh yeah and there's an npu AS and literally everyone has been talking about how AI OMG but uh this npu isn't good enough for co-pilot plus so that's too bad what's immediately
jumping out here though this display looks fantastic it is 2080x 1800p so 16x 10 OLED and 120 HZ and it looks Flipping Fantastic in SDR we measured it as just under 4 400 nits Peak brightness and the color accuracy is kind of all over the place depending what profile you use but for the most part it is staying under that Delta e of2 so you can definitely use this for professional color work also when you put it into HDR mode we measured just over 600 nits Peak brightness Which is higher than their
500 nits advertised but that was only at a 5% window you're looking it more like 400 nits Peak brightness for the full screen but that said those 600 nits in the little tin tiny windows will still be enough to give you a HDR experience when you're in a really dark room this laptop is definitely aimed at being an all-arounder so let's give the keyboard  snip this keyboard is perfectly adequate I was able to get up to full speed without any accuracy problems but at the same time I was not enjoying a second of
it the keys are very consistent so from key to key you can get used to it but also the key stability definitely leave something to be desired like if you look here I can press on the corner we're getting loads of flex right there if you don't hit the key directly in the center you're going to be slowing down for a second it's borderline B minus that said though the trackpad below it is great as we said it has that silly ocean glass on it so it is glass topped it is nice and
large and also I've had no trouble at all with the accuracy on it that's a trackpad click feels pretty good too but not like what you would find on something that's a bit pricier with the force touch trackpad do you guys want to see an incredible feature that so many laptops lack right now oh yeah there we go type A directly into the laptop get on Dell Lenovo has their new yoga 7 it looked so beautiful only USB type-c not even a headphone jack no type a complete right off okay Mac does get a bit of a
pass because in my mind fullsize SD card reader and HDMI does make up for lack of a type A this thing kind of loud you're in normal mode so we're not even in performance yet ooh and in performance it's even louder all right we are in rocket League here and I am currently getting 10 it's really all over the place actually I'm having some frame pacing issues for sure we're currently screen recording what about I stop screen recording there we go minimums of 230 now so I guess that this
is not a super happy GPU when you are screen recording and gaming at the same time I was expecting a little bit better which kind of is just everything about the GPU in this I was expecting a little bit better I really feel like that they could have had quite a bit more cooling back here and then we would have been quite a bit more positive about this it does really seem like this chassis was designed around a 4050 which has that 50 wat TDP and you are not getting everything out of a 4060 or a 4070 our
lab compared this to a 4060 in the Asus G14 which In fairness is a gaming laptop does have quite a bit more power but the 4060 in that absolutely walked all over the 4070 that we have in our Acer right here so just do not buy the 4070 version of this laptop you are not getting a 4070 you are getting at best just a very expensive 40 60 the worst part of all of this is that their configs kind of suck so if you need 32 GB of RAM like maybe you're a video editor or a photo editor
and you just want a GPU even though you don't really need all of that performance you need to get one of the higher end gpus to get the Ram that you will need this is really too bad because the 4050 in this I think would be perfect you can do almost everything it's nice it's pretty light screen's amazing but it is really really throttled once you put those higher end gpus into it that said though for gaming I am having a really great time on this that 120 HZ display plus the OLED we
measured as having nearly perfect latency all right let's test the speakers I do not have High Hopes everything from Acer that I have tested in the last couple years has frankly sucked ass you guys really need to improve your speakers okay that's that's better than I expected although still not great it's uh kind of harsh kind of just bad sounding if I'm honest oh H there are different spatial audio modes in this and traditional just  than so we have games and ener oh wow just turn that off sounds okay in
the normal just stereo mode when you have the spatial stuff on it sounds like butt it does sound wider but it sounds like butt oh we do have some down firing speakers on the side so let's just verify that we don't get it better nah it still kind of sucks Acer you genuinely need to have a big think and go and improve your speakers they are a massive low light on all of your laptops at the moment all right let's look at the webcam this thing is 1080P and it is awful uh I am completely blown
out and also very red looking uh moving over here I am still very redl looking and kind of under exposed and blown out at the same time moving over here uh yeah it's incredibly noisy and blown out and under exposed at the same time oh is genuinely terrible this is a tier of webcam that I have not seen on a laptop in a while this thing sucks oh look at that we also do not get Windows hello facial recognition but we do have a fingerprint sensor right over here which is a nice
little addition the battery itself is 76 wat hours and it was able to last in our endurance test for 7 hours and 37 minutes which is really quite good given the power of this thing and also the fact that it has an OLED display now looking in here first first of all no upgradable Ram it is just soldered down we can see the chips right there which is very very sad because as I said before this would be a much better laptop if you're able to combine the 4050 with 32 GB of RAM because you're
not getting much more than 4050 performance anyway and we can very easily see why right here this is a very anemic cooler we have two little heat pipes that go down here for the CPU and the GPU which explains our CPU was at 102Â° while we were playing rocket league and it's just not enough we we need more Cooling in this if you want to put a 4070 in this Acer it's just not acceptable for this class of GPU also in here we do have upgradeable SSD and an upgradeable Wi-Fi card which
I do really like to see because maybe 60 is pretty good right now maybe you want Wi-Fi 8 in the future or something like that you can just Chuck it in right there and it probably will work I was going to go grab a double-sided SSD but I don't even have to there is so much room underneath this SSD that you're going to have no trouble at all putting a double-sided SSD in right there overall the Acer Swift x14 I do think is a really good laptop even if it is flawed in some ways I do really wish
that I had a bit more Cooling and that would mean that you could have more than the 4050 in this but that said if you want to get the 4050 model which you probably should it's going to start at "$1,400 the one that we have speced here" "is more like 1,700 which I don't think" is a good buy cuz you are not getting value out of that 470 that said you do get a decent keyboard great trackpad it's nice and light and that OLED screen is freaking fantastic so if you're looking for something that can just
cover all of your bases if you want to do video editing photo editing gaming professional work office stuff it's it can do all of it incredibly comp competently and in particular the lowest of the lowest end model which doesn't get the OLED screen and only a 3050 that thing's on sale for 800 bucks right now and that sounds absolutely fantastic there you go if you want a MacBook Pro but do not have MacBook Pro money I do not think that the Acer Swift x14 is something to scoff at Belle
