you might be wondering why we're covering this monitor well lus already did the 27in 1440p version well that's because this is the best monitor I'm telling you it's better this is the aw 3225 qf and it's the 32in 4K version no this isn't 360 HZ but 4K 240 is amazing what we might sacrifice in terms of refresh rate it more than makes up for it in PPI because while the screen is bigger we are also going from like 108 109 PPI all the way up to a whopping 140 don't get me wrong it's still not xdr
pro display territory but man I tell you 140 PPI on a 32in screen 16x9 as much as I love Ultra wide maybe those days are over we've got our classic Alienware stand here column insert and screw it down system then we're going to take everything else out of the box like our cable cover that we're probably not going to install little Alienware box full of what goodies safety and regulatory information for those who care about that and you get an Alienware sticker uh We've also got our C13 power cable a
display port to USBC cable surprisingly enough and an HDMI 2.1 Cable ultra highp speeed click clack and Bo oh it's heavy me get rid of this box here careful you might notice that this is a curved screen which might seem a little weird at 32 in but I think screen size like this it's not going to be that bad uh you're not going to have it curving like right over here it'll be kind of like there in your peripheral vision so it should be okay now as for the io and navigation we've got a oh
yeah traditional Dell Alienware navigation nipple and then that's USB 3.2 gen 1 for type B Upstream port and then USB 3.2 gen 1 type a downstream ports and then these are both HDMI 2.1 with the left one having Arc and E Arc support and then our display port is just DP 1.5 for and then we've also got a couple quick access usba and USBC ports here with support for BC 1.2 power charging on the USBC I can't wait to use HDMI 2.1 to get 4K 240 htz this thing is going to look amazing it's the first QD
Leed to do that but we're not going to take a look at it until after a word from our sponsor thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our CES 2024 coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet they're premium products include PC cases power supplies Water and Air Cooling and fans for desktop PCS with roots in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making highquality parts that are nearly
inaudible this year at CES they're showcasing their new white PC case as white fans and even white hard drive cages step into the world of Silent Computing with be quiet at the link down below 240 HZ oh and I forgot this one is better because it has Dolby Vision on it the other one does not do that um and you're definitely going to want to take advantage of it when you watch HDR content we did our testing for this display and I've got to say it is literally some of the best color
accuracy we've seen in terms of HDR it's just mind-blowing how good it's getting it covers 80% of bt2020 which has been beaten by TVs but that's still incredible for a display of this size we've got the monitor tilted a little bit towards the camera but when I put it straight on and I sit around where I would be when I'm gaming from home uh I've got to say the curve doesn't bother me at all and I've heard that the 4K version is not always going to be curved so if you really don't like this one
maybe just wait a little bit and see what else comes out wow we've got our own HDR footage now from the Ari video check out short circuit uh before we watch our HDR footage I'm just going to make sure that this is actually in uh HDR 1000 mode it's currently just in standard one minor thing that might actually be fixed in a firmware update thanks to the lack of a g-sync ultimate module is I am having a tough time using this navigation nipple and menu to turn the mode to anything else I had to fully
stop HDR in Windows for it to be able to change for me uh we're going to set it to Creator dcp3 gamma iOS 2.2 sure and then we should go be able to go to brightness 15% no no no no no we're going to crank that to 100% in SDR this gets up to about 250 nits full screen which is pretty pretty nice now here we go display smart HDR Peak 1000 baby that's what we want it also does true black 400 but we found it to be super accurate at Peak 1000 as well so set it "to Creator mode and set it to Peak 1,000"
and you are good to go it's going to look pretty great that being said who knows maybe we just got lucky with you know golden golden sample from the factory I hope not HDR enabled and oh my God this looks so good let's get I know it's just Andy but his shirt looks so black his jacket looks like he's right there it looks like he's right there like a window I'm looking through a window oh man honestly you guys it is really impressive look at Andrew look at that highlight on his forehead there and
up in his hair oh that's great then you've got these super dark low lights down here I wish we had like a bigger contrasty scene let's get to one well I guess his black on his uh jacket is actually quite black and the best thing is since it's cutie OLED no matter what angle they look at it from there's zero color shift the green and the blue still looks perfectly green and blue and I know that they're basically perfectly green and blue because it's super color accurate oh any angle and it's just
stunning the red and the gold and oranges just pop so much more on QD OLED honestly no matter whether you're going for an LG display or Samsung I think that OLED monitors are just kind of the future at least until we get tiny micro LED but that has its own set of problems and frankly who knows when the they'll actually become affordable we'll get to the price on this a little later but spoiler alert it's not as bad as you might think considering the specs okay we know the colors look amazing but how
does 4K 240 HZ feel in game oh my God I'm excited uh I've got to admit I don't think that you really need 240 HZ as soon as you're over the like 120 144 barrier it's good enough honestly better than a lot than what a lot of people have access to oh my God I love the Nova it's so fun get out of here bot Pines it's just you know you move you flick and your screen is instantly cleared up now it can be a little clearer I will admit that's the biggest advantage that Linus has on the 27in model is that 360
htz uh when you take a motion blur picture with this thing and with the 360 there's the tiniest bit of blur we'll look at smooth frog in person in a sec here but our still image shows that there's just the tiniest bit of blur when you do it with the 360 HZ it's it's like you're looking at at a still image it's perfect it's basically Flawless the text is so crisp there's just hardly any blur at 240 HZ with the almost instant motion pixel response time of OLED they're on they're off we've got a 4090
in here and uh we're going to see how many frames per second we get at 4K cyberpunk completely maxed out that's kind of the biggest problem with this monitor is that well it's amazing 4K 240 HZ feels great whether you're playing games at that frame rate or not it takes a lot to drive a panel of this caliber frankly I don't know if we're going to get anywhere close we probably won't like in Counter-Strike sure yeah Esports you you can do 4K at a high frame rate and that's fine man this isn't bad we're
doing like 100 110 FPS with like frame gen on and uh everything cranked with path tracing some scenes with path tracing look better than others also I'm not a big fan of frame gen or dlss I find find that they make hair especially even though it's gotten a lot better hair can just look weird and bad um and then I find that this building looks a little grainy and that's probably also cuz of dlss moving a lot of sharp objects it has trouble with but like look at the shadow depth on these uh
palm trees yeah I think dlss and frame gen just still to this day don't look quite good enough for me to want to enable them so that's the other thing is like yeah this is path tracing and everything but we have software turned on that helps keep that frame rate really high and we're still only hitting 110 uh which isn't even half of what this display can actually do so let's turn it off and see what we get this looks pretty great I am going to turn back on either frame gen or dlss because 
FPS it looks amazing like especially when you pay attention to these signs and flat images that aren't going to move too much so you don't notice the low frame rate as much but uh yeah let's let's let's turn it up a little bit and try to give it a hand here path tracing is just such a beast we'll go down from rate tracing overdrive to just rate tracing Ultra okay we'll turn it to Quality yeah see even that is so much better now we're up at to 75 FPS average means we've probably got a minimum of a
1% blow of about 60 which is playable very playable and it's just stunning yeah the nice thing about olad is the blacks just get so Inky and perfect that when you get to something that's truly black you don't get a bunch of Black Crush and it looks super good but then at the same time because we can do up to "1,000 knits we're also not getting any" clipping basically anywhere actually it looks great and then when it comes to QD OLED we've got those essentially perfect colors like especially Reds because
there's no white subpixel helping boost the brightness up we're getting like actually true red and we're getting actually true blue and True Green and they just look phenomenal especially yellows and and and oranges like fire gold Pops I think this looks really good to my own eyes but what does the lab Say it'll do 147% of srgb 99% of P3 and 78% of BT 2020 which is huge in SDR color accuracy we measured an average Delta e of8 with a Max of just two and then in HDR we measured with luminance eror an
average of 3.8 with a Max of 15.7 that is wildly accurate one thing to note we found that standard was a little more inaccurate so we swapped it to Crater and then set gamma to 2.2 and that's how it's just perfect almost how could I forget about brightness SDR we got 250 CDM squared in a 10% window which is pretty decent and then an HDR of course is HDR 1000 so we measured a whopping 148 CDM squared in a 1% window which is very impressive uh this thing will basically do it all it's almost
perfect in just about every way and and uh I'm probably going to buy one because you know what it's just that good I don't know what to tell you it also still comes because it's still Del Alienware it's got that 3year OLED burning warranty so if you are a little afraid maybe don't be I'm you know a little over 2 years into owning my other Alienware and it still has absolutely nothing I take care of it I you know I auto hiide taskbar like we've got here I use a moving desktop background with
wallpaper engine and then I make sure to put my monitor to sleep when I'm not using it it's totally fine sometimes I game with very static elements I play a lot of DOTA and then sometimes you know I'll watch movies with the black bars on the side because it's 16x9 maybe now if I buy this I don't have to worry about that anymore with the performance the color accuracy the pixel density of a screen this size at a price tag of only $1.99 it's a man I think it wins even with the other one being at like $8.99
you save like what 300 bucks I don't know I think this is the way to go it's just perfect in basically every way and it comes out January 11th in North America a little later the rest of the world I think February and I can't wait to get my hands on one thanks for watching short circuit if you want to watch another one check out the lonus video with the 1440p 360 version of this guy he just can't give up those frame rates for the higher PPI but I think he's wrong he's wrong he's wrong
