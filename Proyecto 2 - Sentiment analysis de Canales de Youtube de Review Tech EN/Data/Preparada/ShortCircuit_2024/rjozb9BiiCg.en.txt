oh now I might look like some sort of cyber Soldier freak but I'm telling you we're just wearing some really cool VR Tech that's going to be coming out  this and I still got the controller and I can get back into the game this is all of the crazy Tech that you can find at the shiftall booth at CES and soon it's going to be coming out for you guys let's talk about what all of this stuff is I just need to get it off of me first we're going to talk about this sci-fi Pac mule oat bag in a minute but what I
want to talk about first is two pretty cool Innovations first the flip VR controller that lets you do this and you're back in the game one of the biggest issues with VR adoption is the inconvenience of getting in and out of VR you find yourself moving stuff around you're putting on a headset you're not suddenly blocking out the world to solve that issue we're seeing a lot of development in mixed reality from companies like meta and apple who are basically trying to make it so that the
difference between the outside world and the VR world are as seamless as possible but you still have these pesky controllers that you're going to deal with but until hand tracking gets really good for the time being you're going to be stuck with controllers plus controllers offer a whole host of benefits like joysticks buttons for easy movement pretty much every game you're going to play is going to evolve a controller and a lot of the times that means you have to find a place to put
them if you're trying to take the headset off it's just clumsy you have these little thing they're dangling from your wrists in An Inconvenient way but you don't have to worry about that with these controllers because the moment you want to grab something else else you can just flip them out of the way because you're doing this kind of flipping motion they've had to make a very heavy duty hinge they've rated it for about "20,000 flips who knows how many that" will you will use in the lifespan I
imagine if you're playing a game it's going to be really intermittent but for me I've been having this problem of that it's such a fun fidget toy that I just have it in my hand I'm just like constantly finding reasons to do this over and over it still has all the same inputs and capacitive buttons just like the meta Quest touch controllers so you have an AB button a menu button as well as capacitive and analog triggers and as you can see because of the nature of this controller they've had to move a
lot of the tracking to the outside it's kind of similar to like the knuckles controllers where there's a lot of sensors on the outside this isn't quite final Hardware uh as you can see there's still like holes in it with the infrared sensors um those are going to be covered up by transparent plastic uh but as it stands I think it's a pretty cool product and it's also adjustable very slightly for like hand size so if you're somebody with like longer thumbs or shorter hands you can pull and adjust
and it's more comfortable as as well as you can adjust how far back and how far forward the joyad and connections lie now I think the control advancements are pretty cool but I'm also really impressed by the megx super light but before I try this thing on why don't we flip to our sponsor thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our 2024 CES coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include power supplies case

of headsets and as you can see it's really small you may have seen our video on LT about the big screen Beyond it is a absolutely tiny headset that weighs just 127 G but to get that weight there was a lot of sacrifices that had to be made for example you need to get a custommade face cushion that you can't really replace that easily you also needed to use stick on lenses there's no diopter options for adjusting for different prescriptions for people's Vision there was also no way to adjust
your ipd that's your in pupilary distance basically how far your eyes are apart what the meon X does is that allows all of those conveniences that makes the headset a lot more sharable and puts them in we have a swappable gasket we have a diopter adjustment it's not working on this prototype currently as well as we have adjustable ipd so that you can actually share your headset which was probably the biggest weakness of the big screen Beyond was that it was kind of for you
and only you and they're able to do that while still targeting a very small and very comfortable form factor and and a weight of just 250 g each eye contains a 2600x 2600 micro OLED display very similar to the ones that are in the big screen Beyond but unlike the ones in the big screen Beyond these are 1.3 in which means they're larger why does that matter well when you're trying to take a small like postage stamp size display and expand it to consume the whole field of view of a for the user that requires
intense Optics and doing a lot of hard work with Optics causes internal reflection which can result in chromatic aberration and fringing on colors as well as it means you lose a lot of light from your display like in the big screen beyond for example the actual brightness of the OLED display is in the thousands of nits but what gets to your eyes is around 100 so they lose 90% of their light bouncing stuff around a bigger screen means you're not you're doing less bending and warping of that light
to make sure it gets to the user now they quote that it's going to be above a 100Â° Feld of view they're not really going to disclose that information currently field of view is actually pretty difficult to like measure it can mean a lot of different things especially if you have a flat display versus a display that's in the headset at an angle from my Impressions after wearing it to me it feels a bit wider than the big screen Beyond to be fair I have not had an opportunity to adjust
the ipd or the diopters so I'm not going to talk a ton about Focus or like stuff like that but honestly with the same kind of high resolution that we're seeing on the big screen beyond the screen door effect basically is negligible motion Clarity from this test right now feels really solid there's not a ton of blur and also there's a decent amount of brightness it's not the brightest display I don't know what they have if they can crank it higher I don't know what the limits are for me while
it's not quite as comfortable as the bespoke fit of the big screen Beyond I think with maybe a nice foam gasket I usually tend to prefer those I would honestly be able to wear this for a really long time the snow looks so good on the OLED there like no bloom or anything like that at the edges of the display obviously there's a little bit of color fringing but yeah man I'm so excited for VR to get like actually this good I've been uh waiting for VR to be good for a long time I say this as an
Enthusiast somebody who really enjoys their time in VR there's a lot of problems and the level of convenience that stuff like this is providing is really cool but it is kind of coming at a cost this headset is going to be under "$1,700 is what they say I think they're" "trying to Target more of the $1,200" region which still puts it in like very pricey big screen Beyond territory the controllers however are a little bit more reasonably priced they're at $400 for a pair again it ain't cheap
especially when you can compare it to say your index controllers or your quest controllers this is all outside tracking with we got base stations up here all sorts of stuff but oh man I feel cool when I do this but you know what I feel a little bit less cool is uh when I'm we wearing wearing this thing this thing is called the Mew talk and the idea is that if you're somebody who's like doing a lot of hanging out in VR you're getting excited you might be having a ton of fun
chatting with your friends and you're pissing off your neighbors I'm talking at this volume right now and if I put this on you can't really hear me talking that much anymore but inside it's not just a noise blocking thing it's also a microphone in itself a wireless mic because it's noise blocking they've had to make a couple of accommodations for example there's a silicon gasket to keep the noise in as well as inside there's a foam material to catch all of that spit so it doesn't just pull up in there I
don't think there's a way to cover up the mouth that doesn't feel either dystopian or fetishy you know this is the kind of stuff I'd wear it at home mostly a CES show floor is like the worst case scenario for any sort of VR headset because of like bass tracking is so difficult and you can see by how well this is keeping the tracking going that it's actually really impressive if you aren't that into VR you probably haven't heard of shiftall but I think what they're doing is really exciting and
you're probably going to hear their name a lot more in the future speaking of the future why don't you get subscribed to short circuit and watch our future coverage of CES there's going to be so many cool videos we got so much Cool Tech do it watch gosh
