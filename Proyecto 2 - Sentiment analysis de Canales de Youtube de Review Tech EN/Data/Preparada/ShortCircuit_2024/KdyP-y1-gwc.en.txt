look we've all been there you want a bigger TV but your partner ain't having none of that luckily at CES 2024 CED has the solution for the low low price of a around A4 million us you can have this oh I forgot I'm standing in front of the dummy one this is the solution ceds N1 137 in microed 4k HDR folding TV it's a I mean just look have I not said enough God damn you might have made the connection that seeing it in the kind of down mode versus now that that wasn't the full range of motion typically it's
around 60 to 90 seconds to go from fully closed sculpture mode to the viewing experience it's just that the power in the booth here is not really set up for this and when they were setting up it was kind of like was having a little bit of trouble not really the best power I actually got confirmation the rotation is like 90Â° either way it won't go 180 all the way in One Direction still cool we got a little you know room for improvement in the future maybe for the "$300,000 one now before you say that"
this isn't that cool yes there are folding phones and even folding laptops now those are based on OLED a technology we've all come to know and love this is microled and it's quite a bit different you see just like OLED you get the actual proper the pixel is off black but instead of OLED where you're laying in a missive layer down on a substrate it's actually individual pixels individual LEDs that are I guess soldered together in some form and that's one of the reasons this TV is so freaking expensive
microed is a very new technology and it really has not reached that affordable price point yet and the reason for that is it's very hard to get the LED these close enough together that you can't see them this is their 137 in model but they do go as small as 103 in which is apparently the smallest 4K micro LED display that you can buy you've probably heard of Samsung's the wall which is the same technology just at a larger pixel pitch which means the pixels are further apart so even a huge company like
Samsung that actually makes display panels has had a hard time getting those pixels or LEDs close enough that you could make a display that's high resolution and also small I mean small is a bit of a stretch for 103 or 137 in but for the technology it is quite small Samsung has shown smaller than these microed displays they're just lower resolution and seemingly not actually purchasable although this is kind of one of those things where you you call for a quote you don't really just buy it off
the website right their current the wall is around 6 mm pixel pitch which means 6 mm between each of the LEDs this is around4 which is what enables them to have this density I guess you would call it or this size um and it is apparently unique to them small correction here I found out the 137 in model has a pixel pitch of 7 mm it's the 103 that goes down to4 mm and if you go up to the full size which is 165 in it's .9 mm and the reason for that is well they're all 4K if you make the display bigger and you
don't make the pixels farther apart from each other you're just going to have a giant bezel and your screen's not any bigger you have to space the pixels out more to fill the space if you were to keep the pixel density the same you would have to make the resolution higher and they do actually have 8K models which is also the smallest size 8K microed display apparently on the marker right now they don't manufacture the tiles themselves in house they have a company that builds them for them but
they are built to their specification so they are at least their tiles now speaking of tiles as you probably have noticed this is not a monolithic panel there is a bunch of individual tiles and if you look between the Gap you can actually see where each of them are and they're put together in what they call a wing and the wings fold and unfold together to make the full display just look I'm going to wing this sponsor segue in right here thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our 2024 CES coverage if
you're shopping for your next PC or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet the premium products include PC cases power supplies Water and Air Cooling and fans for desktop PCS with roots in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are nearly inaudible this year at CES they're showcas casing new white PC cases white fans and even white hard drive cages so step into the world of Silent Computing with be quiet at the
link down below you might be wondering why nobody else has made a folding micro LED TV and it's because it's not as easy as you'd think when you assemble a micro LED display out of tiles you actually have to calibrate the display because the gap between each individual tile is never going to be quite the same and the human eye can pick up on weird variances like that very easily so traditionally you take fancy camera in a very dark room and you calibrate the brightness of the pixels on the very edge to be
brighter than the rest of the display so you don't see that Gap to basically make up for it well if you add in the folding despite the Gap apparently being less than a millimeter there is still variance each time you open and close it and if you don't account for that you will see a jarring line in between the individual wings so they've added a sensor in between the wings that detects the distance on close and open to then adjust the brightness of those Edge pixels to make it so you don't see
it and to be honest the effect is pretty convincing standing I mean what am I like 6 ft away let's say in the middle I can't make out the individual pixels and I can't see any lines really if you go off AIS you can maybe start to see tiles but you back up a little bit more and it all just kind of Blends into one it's a really big TV and I like that there's no bezels that's cool naturally something that's designed to be a showpiece like this doesn't exactly have HDMI ports
just chilling on the back of the panel each individual Wing is connected at minimum with a duplex single mode fiber so there'd be five of these running from the controll center to the actual TV itself there will also be two ethernet cables one of which is used for control and the other for The Gap sensors I also asked if you can run ethernet and you can but instead of five fiber cables it's 20 5 ethernet cables which is a lot more and kind of funny because inside of these panels that fiber just gets
converted back to ethernet Because the actual tiles like a standard video wall connect each individually with ethernet and lastly a power cable so that's five single mode duplex fibers two ethernet and a power cable I'm not going to pretend to understand really like the mechanics going on there and I imagine they probably won't tell me but it looks pretty baller I see some stepper Motors in there behind this door that is unlocked is the video processing setup which I'm not
allowed to show you uh they're going to apparently give me an image of what it looks like so here it's literally a standard 19-in rack with their video controller which is a standard kind of off-the-shelf part that you would use for a tiled video wall like this there's a den AVR which they use for video switching this is what you would plug your Xbox or whatever into which is an important note not really made for gaming the display out there runs at a refresh rate of 30 HZ it's fine for
movies it has HDR 10 plus but no Dolby Vision it's just really not great for gaming unless you game on a last gen console on your quarter million dollar TV also in there is a Mini PC that they use for control you can have the whole setup automated with cresten or other home automation things so you don't have to use a giant seamen control panel to move the TV and the power stuff it's probably a power supply of some sort um it does draw a fair bit of power you're looking during operation on the 137 in
at around 3 KW and then typical which is just the display being a display is around 900 watts and it goes up based on size and Down based on size sounds like a lot the Samsung wall also a lot it's just kind of the nature of the technology it will improve with time cost is going to be coming way down on these in the next 5 years they were "saying that they suspect this $250,000" "one to be closer to 100,000 in about 5" years which yes is a monstrous amount of money still but shrink it down a little
bit more maybe you'll have a micro LED monitor on your desk one day probably not one that folds but still now a couple burning questions yes you can sit on it I did ask he said that's the number one thing people ask him it's just kind of should you sit on A4 million doll TV sculpture thing can you get one that goes in the ground yes it's called the M1 they built this specifically for the baller Penthouse where you can't dig like 3 ft into the concrete cuz that would be your downstair neighbor they also make
outdoor variants which is actually where they started those models have a bit "higher pixel pitch but also 4,000 nits" "brightness this one is about 1,000 which" looks pretty bright but we're also in kind of a covered area and that helps a lot um if you were to put this outside it would look super washed out I don't know what else there is to say other than I want one in my bedroom I'm probably not going to get that but one day maybe so check cced out in the description if you have A4 million
dollars burning a in your pocket and you want to build a crazy TV like this they can apparently build them as big or sort of as small as you want oh my God it's just crazy get subscribed so you don't miss the rest of our CES show coverage like the video tell me do you want this TV in your bedroom would you get the one that goes in the ground instead how baller are you
