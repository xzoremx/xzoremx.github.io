I have been waiting for this for so oh Jesus I have been waiting for these switches for so long holy sh balls I remember when we got the first inkling that ubiquity was making 100 Gig switches back in like 2019 2020 it's been that long for us to finally have one on hand to test out this is the ECS aggregation it stands for Enterprise campus switch and you know aggregation I guess that one doesn't stand for anything wow this is a different unboxing experience it opens from the
top I kind of like that this is like how big stuff arrives and I mean let's be honest here this is a pretty big box for a network switch are those rails they are rails got a hardware kit  minute there it is boys and girls oh my God oh my God I thought at this point it was a meme the whole like having redundant power supplies on the ubiquity switch we've wanted it for so long and look at this a redundant hot swappable power supply but why is there only one what is this there's the other one this
is um it's very chill labeling for a power supply so 550 Watts 100 to 240 volt that's good not that much power but remember this is not a Poe switch so in theory shouldn't need that much anyways just a little nice that's got nice click too I'm so stoked about this man you have no idea how long how long have I been waiting to put two power supplies in my ubiquity switch like this ain't no way hell yeah brother how many is that 1 2 3 4 five five fans and they're hot swappable this is Enterprise
baby you guys finally did it slow clap for ubiquity I promise I'm not being sarcastic I'm actually just excited that we're finally here great I mean these are just little they're Delta fans little single ones here very cute and then here this is the money maker around this side boys and girls we have 48 25 GB sfp28 ports along with six qsfp 28 100 Gig ports that works out to a combined 3.6 terabit per second of switching capacity in this bad girl aside from all that there is still the
traditional ubiquity little screen on the front which I'm sure is a touchscreen you know surprisingly not like a bunch of extra ventilation this is a pretty normal ubiquity amount there's no there's no extra on the side it is a little different on the side because it has rail holes I don't think that they're like the rails on the cloud key Enterprise where it's just a shelf that they sit on this will probably be the actual rails that actually slide in and out okay these look like nice rails
oh yeah they're toolless I like that you know in a universe where you were doing things properly you would still screw them in but I don't know what universe that is cuz it's not the one I live in King slide oh yeah okay so these are just like these are just name brand rails I don't remember what other machine I saw with Kings slide rails but they are a company that makes rails for other companies from Taiwan the one thing I can potentially see as an improvement Point here is adding little
studs on this guy so that you can put the slide on tool thisly and the best part like I said earlier is we have two why do we have two because this new Switch amongst a bunch of other things which I'll mention later has multi-link aggregation which if you're not familiar it allows you to take one device like a server or another switch and Uplink it to two other devices pretty much every other switch vendor on the planet has has had it forever but ubiquity has not and now they do it occurs to me I did
not look through the cable accessory box we have one cable the other cable for the other power supply came in the power supply box so that makes sense we have oh nice lips in right there you get your power cable plug it in and then Loop the cord in the little thingy tighten it now you can't accidentally yank this out not all switches have this some Dell ones I've interacted with have just just like a cable tie looped around which I don't know if is better than this this is
pretty pretty easy what else is in here oh there is still ears can you run this with just the ears I could check the instructions nope doesn't say about that see you later screws for the rails nice more ear things that's it man I think the only thing left that's missing on this switch is a dedicated management Port that's the only thing I'm kind of Going H about but let's turn it on wa is it araba they have ether lighting which is different when you have SFP and qsfp ports because there's no like thing to
light up they just made the little indicators light up that's cute do you think they light up behind too I'm are you ready oh there's no RGB it's just our sponsor vessie thanks to vessie for sponsoring this video they offer all kinds of stylish functional shoes for everyday wear while keeping your socks dry in less than desirable weather you can even save up to 40% on select Styles at their Black Friday sale right now our team here loves their vessies because here in Vancouver the weather is always so

this is a mini Forum ms01 it's a small core I9 Mini PC that happens to have a pcie slot so I went ahead and put in a connectx 6 dual 25 gig card which will allow us to Uplink this computer to both of these switches I know for UniFi this is unheard of but now M leg it should just work uh right now I just have the switches connected with one 100 Gig cable and then to the dream machine with a 25 gig cable but really it's running at 10 gig we're going to go in and set up the M leg in the software hopefully
uh and at that point we'll be able to add another one of these cables so for the top one that only has one power supply it says the second power supply is not installed cool so it's aware of that on the bottom one which does have both power supplies but one is unplugged it just says 0% but it doesn't say unplugged or anything like that so ubiquity I know you're watching this so probably fix that here's a further test I want to take it out like mid operation now will it complain no it
just says not installed so there's probably some adjustments that can be made there given this is one of the first ubiquity products with redundant power um I'm not too mad about that but it's definitely something they should look at improving cuz it would be really good to know if your second power supply that you're thinking is a backup isn't installed or failed or somehow lost power now let's try the UI I suspect the M lag thing is under Port manager I do kind of wonder if the speed has to
change in groups of four or groups of two if you've ever used one of their Enterprise xg2 24 switches which has the two 25 gig ports on the side those two ports if you want to use 25 gig on one of them they both have to run at 25 gig uh I don't know how that applies to this switch if there's groupings like on Dell switches a lot of the time it'll be like four individual ports will be grouped together so if you want them at 25 gig they all have to be at 25 gig or if you
want to go 10 gig on one of them none of them can do 25 gig I don't know how that works on this switch so if I plug this guy out of here and into this port I suspect it will not work because this one is running at 25 gig it's not lighting up okay what about this one oh there we go okay so it did it did light up okay let me put it back over here and see cuz that took a while oh wait it did turn on what the hell what is this magic I mean don't get me wrong it would be sick if all of
these ports could be independently controlled between 25 and 10 gig like the Dell switch that we have in the server room is not like that when you have any port set at 25 gig all of the rest of the four in that group have to also be at 25 gig which doesn't seem to be the case here I don't know about the one directly underneath let me try that maybe they're grouped in twos I don't know just for reference usually 25 gig ports are grouped in fours because it's like 100 Gig connection can split into
four no it turned on so the one on top is at 25 gig and the one on the bottom is at 10 gig sick it makes it seem like in the dashboard that there's a limitation I think that might just be left over from the XG 24 uh it's probably just anytime that 25 gig is set it shows that warning but it doesn't seem to be the case on this switch which is awesome okay let's make our MC leg I think we call this big big thicky switches stacking optional combines the top and bottom switch into a single
entry I'm going to try that off for now and then we have multi-chassis link directly connected ports between the top and bottom switch to form the M leg and forward traffic increases throughput aggregating ports increases redundancy okay set up so I picked 53 and 54 on each hit save so far this UI is very nice and easy and then Target devices membership so Target devices is where you would configure a client whether that be another switch or a computer which in our case we are using a
computer so let's go ahead and configure and we'll say number one on both of them but I could pick a different one potentially is that what it is I'm in number one yeah okay save hey it's doing it there we go I guess we have a we have a m lag now hey multi chassis link status connected it seems like it just took I don't know 30 seconds to kind of do the magic behind the scenes um it would be cool if there was like a loading indicator that popped up in the top right like Hey we're processing this
change or something like that just so you knew what was going on uh but not the end of the world I'm going to configure this box now to have a link aggregation and then we'll see if the sauce works now that we've got our minis Forum connected I can set up a link aggregation says Target device membership is not established please check that all ports are connected with the same speed and that a lag is configured on the target device I just configured the lag on the target device
so in theory now in a moment or two it should pop up and say yo dog you're lagreg gated hey connected look at that this is now running across two switches that's pretty cool I mean I know that it's we do this every day with the Dell switches but this is this is new for you mcy this is crazy I'm so excited now they have a proper redundant option for like a high-speed core switch not only is this their first like 100 Gig offering but it's also pretty compelling package they actually built out the feature set
before releasing it which is really cool it's got redundant power it's got redundant cooling I don't know if there's anything to complain about here aside from the lack of a dedicated Management Port how much does this thing "cost this is $4,000" "us so if we have two that's $8,000 Us in" ubiquity land that's crazy I'm setting up a second minis Forum so we can do a little speed test and I just hit apply so I have I perf running on one machine as a server and on the other I'm running
it as a client it's doing 40 gbit and this is just at 1500 MTU we're not using jumbo frames or allowing the machines to send bigger packets with less overhead uh which is usually something you need to do well less so these days but frequently in the past something you need to do to be able to achieve speeds like this but 1500 MTU across both switches like 50 gig these are only 25 gig ports that means it's using both ports on our machines here I'm going to do something a little funky and I'm not
going to Uplink both of them to both switches I'm going to take one of them and move it to a single switch that way to achieve the full bandwidth of both cables it will have to cross the links that go between the two switches it should be exactly the same realistically we're not even close to put pushing these switches at all oh I can't actually do that it it blocks it out and says use MC leg group to configure aggregation I guess there's not really any reason you you should do what I was
just proposing other than to just try this out but that's interesting it would be cool if you could name the aggregation devices in here I know that you can name the ports but it would be sick if there was a name field and then that automatically applied to the ports itself I like on Dell's enter price switches that you can basically put a description on anything which is very helpful ubiquity you should do that that would be great so I'm going to unplug one port from each of these devices
we'll unplug this mini Forum from the top switch and then I'm going to unplug this minis for them from the bottom switch that way they're each connected only to one of them so if we run a speed test now that traffic is going to have to go you know through this cable across our multi chassis links to the other one and I want to just make sure that that still works yeah okay everything's fine we're traversing our multi chassis links like nothing even happened lovely if I
plug these back in will it just pick up the speed without having to restart the test 47 gabit very nice for the amount of setup required if you already had your devices like computers or servers or switches already plugged into to both ports you're talking like 30 seconds of setup the last thing I want to see is the stack mode because that sounds pretty dope and okay I wasn't really sure what I was expecting but it's it's just two switches on one page which yeah okay great I mean overall this has been super
seamless I got to see what's inside this switch though I'm GNA have to open it LTT store Precision screwdriver set I like while I take these things apart it would be good to mention that they are layer three switches so they are going to have vrrp which is basically a redundant routing protocol available soon and then also bgp on these switches which is pretty cool I think they're not in the current Network version coming soon kind of vibe so who knows when that will be and I wouldn't buy it based on
that until that feature is out and tested you can use this as a router run a network on the individual switch have it be DHCP or DHCP relayed if you want I'm very curious to see what type of switch chip is in here because when they originally made the kind of like demo Early Access version of a 100 Gig switch which like I mentioned before was a long time ago uh it used not like a tier one switch chip so not from like broadcom or anything like that it was from a less common SLP
poopular brand which some people did not like hey oh look at that it's not that full it's a fair bit of empty space in here I mean it's not uncommon for switches of this size it looks like the reason for the empty space here is so the power supplies fit and plug right into the board show me what you've got whoa what's going on here why is there a land port what are you doing in there ethernet Jack I swear to God if they worked in the functionality to have a management port and then decided not to
put it on oh my God that would be so so silly looks like they got a custom PCB here for the fan power and fan control that's cool there's a seamos battery in here I guess that makes sense this is an fpga right here field programmable gate array it's kind of like a CPU but can be customized they usually use those on applications where it's not worth building custom silicon and still need it to be fast and then an m.2 slot that has no storage in it I'm I'm very confused why there's like a daughter
board that has a lot of cooling on it it looks like it could be socketed which would be interesting I mean what could be under here either a CPU or a switch chip but I think over here is the switch chip so this must be a processor maybe oh what the hell this is the computer that runs this switch you see there's a memory slot there and then if you look inside I'll take this off there is another memory slot so this is actually the brains of this switch I don't know why it's on a daughter board
that's very very cool I guess that means you could replace this if it failed I mean usually the high-end switches from other companies are also built in a modular fashion like this at least to some degree hey look at that there's a Kingston Ram stick it's a 16 GB ddr4 3200 megga transfer stick and then that's an Intel c3558 R CPU four cores four threads 2.4 G base clock and it's 17 Watts it's from 2020 it's not a crazy CPU by any stretch of the imagination I don't know what
kind of like throughput there is between this board and the switch itself it's not a crazy fast CPU on its own so I imagine it's not doing a ton of fancy routing stuff this computer module over here is like this I guess because they're going to use this platform for other things but I found out the switch actually runs Sonic which is an open-source switch operating system which is really cool so this little computer here runs ubiquities management software and Sonic and allows those to
work together and use this Sonic switch with ubiquity controller and to manage everything which is cool I mean Sonic is great and I'm glad that they're using it because seems like a pretty obvious choice the question then is what switch chip is this using Marvel this is a 98 CX 8514 a I mean that's great they're a big name switch chip manufacturer I don't know if people classify them as like the best I know people kind of have a hard on for broadc comp but yeah I guess I've
seen what I needed to see it would be cool if they had m.2 storage on here so that you could swap it but I guess if you had an issue with the soldered storage that's on here you could use the m.2 slot here to replace it and reinstall it seems like a pretty sick switch it's four grand it's out of my budget but if you're looking for a topof rack switch that has multi- chassis link aggregation and you need 25 or 100 Gig seems like this could be a decently affordable option I'm happy that they
did most of the feature stuff before they released the switch if they had released this and been like oh yeah ml it's coming later I'd be like I know that they still did that with bgp and vrp but at least that is there and I'm excited to see what other switches are going to have ml come to them because that's pretty sick feature so if you like this video like the video get subscribed to short circuit and if you're looking for something else to watch why not check out the UniFi Cloud
Gateway Max kind of a different vibe than this but if you needed a cheap controller cuz you spent all your money on six switches I kind of doubt it makes sense but maybe maybe it's an option
