we're here with Acer at CES 2024 to check out just a whole whack of laptops and even a monitor we're just going to throw them all straight at your face just like this laptop right here is throwing 3D stuff straight at my face it is so cool this is the Aspire 3d5 spatial Labs Edition we did see spatial Labs stuff last year but it had a couple of problems the main one being uh even if you wanted it the laptop started at like 4 grand you probably were not going to be getting it well now this thing
here starts at $13.99 and the amount that it has improved over last year is incredible cuz like I'm currently enjoying watching this and the even more impressive part is that this right here is not a 3D video so we can just exit out of this I've just opened up crab Brave and by hitting alt G it does some AI magic and just turns it into a 3D image now this isn't new for this year per se but they've been training the AI models for the past year and the Improvement is incredible because like this scene right
here is really great where like this Palm actually looks like it's way out in front of all of the crabs like the fact that they were able to do this on the fly in real time and turn it into 3D of this quality I am quite impressed now of course if you do have a 3D model or a 3D program it works really great and that as it did before but I am just so impressed at the Improvement in this cuz if I am honest when I looked at these last year they just kind of made me sick and this is not doing that I am actually
quite stoked at how much better this is especially for how much cheaper it is for those of you that don't remember from CES last year and fair enough this spatial Labs technology works so that you don't have to use glasses by having a 4K panel but when you enable 3D it splits it and halves the resolution horizontally so half of those pixels are being sent to to your left eye and half are being sent to the right it is doing that by aiming them through a lenticular lens and it is tracking where exactly
your eyes are using cameras right here to make sure that like this tree and stuff are going correctly into this eye and this eye to give you that depth of field and it's actually really quite neat just how well they've done it as for the computer itself we can see we have 3.5m headphone jack type A on the other side wow there's actually a lot of I/O on this Thunderbolt 4 two more type A's HDMI and a fullsize ethernet port dang and on the inside you get up to an i7 13620 H 32 GB of RAM and a
57w battery now if we give this a little bit of a push test it's not bad it's not bad I've seen better I have definitely seen worse and the keyboard and trackpad  point I would say say that they're not going to hinder you you will be able to get up to full speed and the trackpad is decent enough but they aren't like standouts like this display is what is a real standout though is this Aspire go 14 this is the Acer Aspire go 14 there is also a 15in version and I am amazed
that they were able to get a laptop of this quality down to $250 starting price like if we looked at this here we we can give it a bit of a bit of a push it's you know it's not the best built laptop in the world and we do not expect that at all but holy crap compared to the other $250 just pieces of actual e-waist that I have seen before this is actually incredible so the standouts here first of all 14-in 16 by10 display starting at $250 processor nothing incredible we
have is an Intel n100 that's four cores four threads and a 6 wat TDP so it's not going to be too quick but given that laptops at this price point in the past have had like two core seller on it's going to be a whole world of difference like you are not going to be doing fluid simulations on this thing but you will be able to watch YouTube videos at full resolution and not have it be slow the keyboard also is just perfectly functional there's nothing wrong about it which is quite shocking given just
how inexpensive this thing is I'm used to key caps at this price point being just smaller than a normal size key caps they'll cheap out in that way and like if we look at this the key stability I "have seen ,000 laptops or in the case of" "Razer $2,500 laptops that have worse" Keys than this thanks to be quiet for sponsoring a CES 2024 coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include PC cases power supplies
Water and Air Cooling and fans for desktop PCS with roots in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are nearly inaudible this year at CES they're showcasing their new white PC case as white fans and even white hard drive cages step into the world of Silent Computing with be quiet at the link down below one thing isn't sure about is just how upgradeable this thing is and one thing that's unfortunate is that at that
$250 price point you are only getting 4 GB of RAM so let's see if you can change that and after 10 Phillips head screws I can say unfortunately you cannot the ram is soldered down right here so you will have to shill out for something like the 8 GB of RAM model we've done a little bit more digging and it appears that the storage that comes with it is also soldered down which is a little little bit strange so there's flash on here somewhere I guess on the other side of the board but fortunately you can
upgrade it right here so we have a Gen 4 SSD slot and I would strongly recommend looking to upgrade that pretty soon after you get one of these also in here we have a 53w hour battery and given this CPU only draws 6 wats I imagine that you're going to be able to get pretty decent battery life out of this thing final thing in here Wi-Fi card that is a aable nice moving back to it assembled the I/O that we have is 3.5 mm headphone jack fullsize USB type A or on the other side another fullsize USB type
a HDMI and USB type c up next we have the Swift go 14 and this is sort of a choose how good it is kind of laptop you can have the $750 version which is going to be not particularly fast comes with a 1200 piece 60 HZ panel that's only got srgb coverage or you can go all the way up to a 90 HZ 2.8k overed panel that looks just absolutely fantastic those viewing angles are very good is it touch a darn it's not touch this comes with up to 32 GB of memory and AER are really proud about their media touchpads so if
we swipe across this now we have our volume controls pause play in the center we can go forwards backwards mute all the stuff that you know you have hard buttons for up here uh I don't really know how useful this is but at the same time it's it's neat it's neat I'll give them that with the Swift go Acer are continuing their trend of just having fantastic iio on their laptops this has a Micro SD card reader 3.5 mm headphone microphone combo Jack fulls sizee USB type A or on the other side two
Thunderbolt fors HDMI 2.1 and another USB type A so you can just plug all the things into this it's actually really sick the keyboard on the Swift go1 14 is pretty decent I would give it maybe a B+ same sort of thing I don't hate it but at the same time there's nothing particularly special about it although if we go over to the Swift go 16 it's largely the same compared to the 14 but we don't get that media touchpad and we also don't get a keyboard that I enjoy uh if we look at this right here we have
a nice large keyboard and we do have a numpad some people love that but the chassis in it becoming a bit larger has become pretty soft right here and uh you can really tell so the keys on the left side pretty good keys on the right side pretty good and the keys in the middle here right where your right hand is are uh not nearly as good they're very mushy cuz the whole chassis is flexing we won't dwell on the Swift go 16 too long then because instead I want to talk about the spicy Swift this right here is
the Swift x14 and this thing is the very fancy one the keyboard is a definite improvement from the other ones that we have seen and although I don't think it gets into the A's I'm going to give it a B+ plus cuz I actually am kind of an oh no I think it gets an A minus this is actually quite a well-built machine and the internals are even more better this thing has up to an RTX 4070 in a laptop of this size so that right there would have 60 watts plus 15 watts Dynamic boost just for the GPU and
the display options on this are awesome with having up to a 2.8k OLED at 120 HZ and this has that variable refresh rate technology so it can go down to 48 HZ in order to save you a little bit of battery we also have up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185h so this thing right here even though it's only 3.42 lbs is actually going to be able to do some very serious work or even gaming quite serious gaming I would say IO once again absolutely fantastic very similar to the Swift go4
love to see all of this and if you're looking for something like this with its starting price of "$1,400 which of course doesn't get you" all of this it's like a 4050 but it still is very very compelling moving over to the gaming side of things Acer has released their new predicator Helios neol line now it is quite similar to the Helios line that they had before but Acer have been really smart about the ways that they have costed down the Helios line because honestly I don't
think you're going to care about the stuff that you're losing too much so we're getting Zone RGB we have four zones instead of the per key RGB that we have on the full-fledged Helios but uh whatever you don't get this little RGB Predator logo right here I'm sure you're very torn up about that just like this RGB light bar on the back oh no you don't get it that's going to really affect your gaming performance I imagine also uh you have less configurability about the RGB on the Predator logo on
the back if you look right here this one right here is like a little bit nicer but the stuff that actually matters performance has remained unchanged so if we look right here they heat pipes this is not new for this year but it is pretty cool to see that on the older models they have these rounded heat pipes like you see on pretty much every single laptop which work well enough but what they have on their Helios line are these Square heat pipes so you can see just how much more surface area you're
going to have hitting the hot spots of your computer and just getting that heat out of there by having this Square heat pipe design instead of just just losing all of that area to the little rounded edges on the side as for the specs and pricing the Neo 16 starts at $14.99 the Helios 16 is $18.99 Neo 18549 and the Helios 18 $2000 as for the exact specs I would say that you're going to have to just kind of look at what each one is able to do at each price because there's just such
a large range from a 4050 to a 4090 and mini LED IPS panels you're just going to have to look at each one when they actually release it in April at the start I said we had a monitor and oh my God Acer has deliver this right here is the Predator Z series z57 and it is a 57in dud panel that's dual Ultra HD this thing right here is like they took two 4K 32in panels and just crammed them together and then gave gave it a big old curve and oh my God like it's actually crazy when you just step up to this and
you're right here pretty much your entire field of view is occupied by this thing and holy crap does this look good it's one of the most immersive gaming experiences that I have seen and I have seen quite a few in my days the amount that I want to hook this thing up to like a big old racing Sim holy crap that would be amazing as for other specs 120 HZ refesh fresh rate 1 millisecond "response time 1,000 nits Peak brightness" "so this right here has vesa 1,000 HDR" support and holy crap I am just going to
have a bit of a look at this again and maybe even a bit of a game oh driving simulator time here we go holy crap this thing is cool yeah this would be so good for iRacing oh my God just like it would be really good if you hit like get subscribed and just have have a great old day see you later at the next booth
