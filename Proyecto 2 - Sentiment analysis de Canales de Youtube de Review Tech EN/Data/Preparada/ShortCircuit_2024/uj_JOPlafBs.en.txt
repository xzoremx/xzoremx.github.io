Asus says that incredible comes from within well I say that they sponsored this video so I can look at the New Zen screen fold OLED or as I like to call it the FED we got probably the monitor here but what I want to see is what's in this black box looks like it's a Max 30 W wall wart I'll just put that to the side take off this foam and look at what's under the box uh because this looks like a carrying case Asus Zen screen feels cushiony even though I've done is press it through the plastic the benefit to
being foldable means that when it's folded up your portable monitor should be able to fit in this what 12 12 1/2 in bag I'm a little dubious but we're going to find out it's a pretty nice box with a pretty nice label it's our Asus zenc screen fold OLED portable monitor mq1 17q when will they do away with crazy monitor names I'll never know but the funny thing is is the Box folds open too no one I couldn't just open it all right I guess they're really going for a folding experience this is probably the
screen it's heavy enough uh it should be about 1.17 kilos so not super heavy uh We've also got an HDMI to Mini HDMI cable we've got a Asus booklet it thanked me for buying the product and then I gave me the warranty that's my VIP member notice um then what else have we got this is heavy this is oh if you want to put it on a stand it does come with a 1/4 in thread that you can use to attach it to a stand we've also got a right angle USBC to not right angle USBC connector uh We've also got a nice
little what is this cleaning cloth not a big deal but it's nice that they include it why is it all in plastic this is my you know it's a really minor nitpick but I've had to take everything out of plastic for this whole thing and I really would have loved it if uh you know it's all sealed in here really nicely they could have just laid it flat and that would have been okay basically super easy peasy Ikea instructions telling me how to turn on the monitor all right let's open it take this plastic cover
off and see what's inside I still it's like a giant book like it's like if I've got two tablets and I've got it like right in front of me it's like a giant book or something and then if you do want to read it like a book maybe a big cookbook on your countertop it's got a kickstand on the back look at that we'll talk about the price later it's very expensive I'm not going to lie to you guys it's very expensive but it's pretty cool it's pretty nifty it's the world's first portable OLED foldable monitor um
it's also got hey look at this f- OLED on the back I was literally calling it fed for funsies and everyone's like that's stupid no one should call it foled I I was right we've got our qu inch thread right here that should hook into this guy it's got this little post on the bottom and then our screw at the top and then you can see it's got a guide there and then you just screw it down wow I like the Asus logo on the front here looks pretty cool reminds me of the Star Trek logo other than that
it's pretty clean it's got little Asus Zen fold printing on the back here so you know exactly what it is and then we've got it on the side as well and uh then we've got our ports and power buttons or IO up here looks like we got a headphone jack mini HDMI display port alt display port alt through USBC I like how they're both uh display port it makes perfect sense it's a monitor um and then we've got an array of buttons I'm sure one is power the other three not sure we'll have to try them out we
should be getting a nice 2560 by 1920 in this aspect ratio which should be a good amount of PPI nothing too crazy as for the crease when it's folded out and it's all the way down and flat it's only really visible from some angles if I'm dead on it's actually not too bad and I'm sure with content you can barely even notice it but we'll have to judge that for ourselves later man I can't oh my God it just feels so uncomfortable for me to open and fold screens like it's it's like I'm opening
a laptop but then it's just all screen but as uncomfortable as I may be folding it up to take it away with me let's power it on and see just what a portable foldable OLED monitor looks like in 2024 one minor complaint Asus I really I know it's portable and most of the time your stuff's going to be right here but you do advertise it as being able to be put on a stand and used as a regular monitor but my computer's all the way down here and my power is a little further than that so I just want a longer cable
please two longer cables the power will not reach where ours is and then our HDMI probably will reach but it's going to be a little tight so one moment please while I get the stuff plugged in okay now that it's all fired up it you know the colors look pretty good we actually tested them more on that later and they're not too not too shabby uh let's make sure everything's set to the right thing yeah 2560 by 1920 and unfortunately to say it is only 60 HZ it is a portable monitor but you know
what when you're land gaming like at a land event do you need 12 Herz it'd be nice but 60 it's good enough to gain so let's uh turn hdr on I've got to say the crease on a dark background is a lot more noticeable especially when you're off AIS but when there's color and there's actually content displaying and you're kind of bang on it's really not that bad let's try some games let's try doom doom Eternal look at that aspect ratio it's weird with the blue boxing the nice thing about Doom is
that we know it'll do a weird aspect ratio I've just got to set it within the actual menu 16 by 10 no no no no no we want 4x3 babies 2560 by 1920 apply yeah this is doomed the way it was meant to be played on a CRT well now it's OLED but we're still 4x3 and I got to say I really like 4x3 I think for games there's something kind of nice about it especially on a smaller screen and like I've got to say say the display looks really good like that's just OLED for you uh with self admissive pixels it's
such a good time compared to even like a really high-end mini LED display I'm just kind of team OLED now and especially with image retention and Vernon being such a thing of the past it's still possible but like most people who are daily driving these monitors even a year or two now from now myself included I still don't see any so I mean maybe down the line but so far so good I wish it was a higher refresh rate but like it looks solid you know what I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's the
most responsive display I've ever used in my entire life but if I was at a land event or if I'm just kind of gaming on the go this is totally good enough with an OLED portable monitor like this we're getting a crazy high contrast ratio some people like to say it's like a million to one or infinite because your black is going to be perfectly black and then your brights are going to be not too bad I think we're getting a top end of about 500 nits in HDR which is perfectly respectable it's not
going to be you know a high-end TV or anything like that but I mean it's a portable monitor do you really need it "to be 1,000 nits I don't you know that" does look really good yeah it's about 4.9 million pixels so even though it's 4x3 it's kind of like it's QHD or 1440p um and and a on a 17-in screen it's plenty of pixels it looks pretty good really decent PPI just going to check out the latency a little bit with Counterstrike I'm going to like you know it's not perfect obviously it's 60 HZ
but it's totally usable I hope that if you're trying to be competitive at a l event you're bringing like a full scale monitor like this is just for if you want to Game On The Go it's okay I think we measured about 8 millisecs for response times and about 37 milliseconds of latency but that's perfectly usable for a foldable OLED monitor but next up let's talk color accuracy and the rest of our testing results in standard mode we measured an average Delta e of five with a Max of 8.5 rounding up nothing
groundbreaking but solid for a portable monitor as for HDR in bt2020 game HDR was our most accurate mode with a Delta ITP of 7.7 on average and a Max of 17.9 it's actually pretty respectable for HDR content we've seen better we've seen worse it's not going to be a disappointing display when you're looking at HDR content OLED just looks so good these days because they finally figured out how to make it bright enough without having to worry too much about image retention or bur in and the result
is good it speaks for itself I mean it's it's really just hard to beat and until microed can come out with something that makes it single pain instead of multiple small pains so that you're always looking at a crease it's going to be "good but the reality is it's $2,200 us" which is very expensive and I assume it's going to be for a very Niche crowd however those of you who do want it who can afford it it's pretty sick because check this out just going to unplug it Fold It Up put it into our handy danding
carrying case now that it's only 12 1/2 in and then we just drop it in the case came with it so you don't have to go buy one and like at about 2 and2 lb it's pretty light this will fit in a backpack no problem uh I feel pretty comfortable just like tossing it around even though it's a very expensive monitor um feels like a pretty sturdy case to be perfectly honest and that's the Asus Zen screen foldable OLED world's first it's awesome it's expensive I think that if you do want it you know check out the
