I've long believed that Hardware can make you a better gamer but when it "comes to 8,000 HZ pulling rate keyboards" and mice I've been a bit dubious so when corera decided to sponsor this video so we could check out the k70 pro tkl with their version of snaptap I said we'll give it a try after we open the box we've got our typical warranty guide we've got our safety and compliance information and then we've got the keyboard just right on top here let's look at everything else first cuz
there's some stuff underneath it should come with I think a wrist rest yep that's what this looks like o I like the paper packaging with the Corsair logo I do really like the look of the logo here but I kind of wish they'd maybe put it up here instead of uh right in the center because it is magnetized by the way uh but one of the problems that might encounter is if you go and you move over just a little bit you're on the edge of your palm just going to touch it it's it's not the worst it's
totally fine but of corser just move it I like it I like the style I like the rest of the wrist rest to be honest I like this uh design they've got going on this little texture pattern that they have here feels nice comfortable squishy just enough give I'm not big on like granite or wood wrist rest personally I like a nice foam one they're nice and soft there's only one other thing in here and it is long it's probably about 6 ft 5.5 no it's more 5.5 all right it's got the mgx hyperdrive magnetic switches
but then it's not all the hyperdrive magnetic switches the F keys are regular so that's really cool with these being magnetic and hall effect that means that we can change all of our actuation points we've looked at this a lot in the past with other keyboards that have kind of done it first but especially with snaptap becoming dominant in the FPS scene it's going to give you that kind of fine-tuned control uh let's say you want to action the key as soon as you basically press it so feather touch boom
it's down and then the nice thing is what it can also do is basically once it's stopped going down the moment it lifts it'll reset so instead of having to go up all the way I can take my finger off this key just slightly and then push down and it'll action again right away but while I'm a gamer what I care more about is the look and the feel and the sound of my keyboard as I type on it and game on it and do everything in between uh so how does it actually you know it's really it's kind of better than I was
expecting I know that this is spawn sped but I mean you guys will be able to hear it and make your own judgment call here but my biggest pet peeve on most keyboards is the stabilizers particularly the space bar no rattle or at least very little I can't really make any out enter has got a little bit just the test shift as well but it's really you know the space bar is usually cuz that you're touching the space bar all the time you know every between every word and as for the
sound aside from you know checking out the stabilizers the rest of it sounds pretty decent they've got two layers of sound dampening silicone which really helps uh with this version versus the previous ones that did not I'm not going to lie to you guys it's not my favorite keyboard in terms of sound it's not the most amazing sounding one but the thing is companies like Corsair their keyboards have come so far in the last few years they've had to play catchup but they've kind of done it admirably
and I've got to say this is like good enough for most people especially when what you're really looking for is that 8 khz pulling rate and those hall effect switches it feels okay too uh they're linear they're pre- lubed already which has been so much better in the last year or two when it comes to buying switches I used to actually recommend against Factory Prelude because they didn't do a good job or if it was a good job it'd be fine on some switches and then really bad on
others uh so it's just kind of all over the place but it feels like that's been fine-tuned over the last year or two but that's all the hollow effect switches how are the F Keys cuz those use another one those use their plasma switches and these are just regular linear sure they're fine also preu from the factory key caps are a double shot PBT although you can get the ABS version we'll talk about price later but the ABS one is 10 bucks cheaper in my humble opinion I think you should just get the
PBT spend the extra $10 but to each their own and then they've got their classic brushed aluminum finish I'm not crazy about the brushed aluminum you guys please just stop brushing the aluminum just make it aluminum I do like the stamped Corsair logo here and then I like that they've got this included knob it's hard to go wrong with a solid knob really satisfying tactile feel uh but then these two buttons are just buttons and they don't really spin or anything I'll have to plug it in and find out
what exactly they do but I wish they were just a tad more satisfying I also really like the angle of the case and how the edges are nice and clean uh it's just a plastic chassis on top underneath this kind of brushed aluminum uh top plate here they've got USBC and then on the back of the keyboard they've got this pretty cool uh just Corsair logo in the middle for looks and then as per usual when it comes to the big name brands and keyboards they've got adjustable feet something else to note is that's a
good that's incredibly satisfying um they're also what feels to be a very durable nice rubber feel so that they're not going to it's not going to slip very much like I'm really pushing on this thing here uh in terms of durability though it's pretty solid there's like really not a lot of flex at all I'm actually surprised I was expecting a bit more decently heavy but not too heavy I kind of wish it was Wireless but then the weight would go up with the included battery and one of the big benefits of
going with a keyboard like this is you can just go to a store and buy it like you can just walk in a Best Buy and buy one you don't have to sign up for a group order you don't have to order something online just walk in hand the guy your credit card or cash and walk out with your brand new keyboard uh but let's try it out you know properly we'll see some RGB we'll try typing on it where I have actual words to type instead of random gibberish one moment please okay ladies and gentlemen here we
go one8 97% that's not too bad I've been slowed down a little bit because I'm used to typing on chicklet style keyboards right now I've been using my laptop quite a bit uh also I have a flat uh XDA low profile kind of set at home that I've been really enjoying and I really like this the RGB is nice it shines through really nicely nice and bright nice and colorful I love the blue um I don't know if it's just because of the white and gray and aluminum that it's kind of Illuminating uh but I
really like the tone of the RGB or the Hue of the color I will say Corsair IQ it's great is it kind of frustrating sometimes yes but it works it's pretty cool you hit function all the lights turn off except for like your FR row and windows and FN uh let's open IQ check out some of the hall effect customization you can do because they say that you can go anywhere from .1 to 4 mm of actuation and they've actually suggested that we go anywhere from4 to 3.6 you could go as low or as high as
you want I guess but somewhere in the middle is usually about right the other thing is you can change that in .1 mm increments so let's open IQ and take a o lighting effects new feat features exclusively for the Corsair k70 Pro RGB tkl keyboard Okay click on the oh control dial rotate the control dial left and right to adjust brightness let's turn all the way oh that was fast okay I'd like a few more steps but I I guess you actually don't really need it like four or five steps or whatever's
here is good that's honestly pretty sweet okay what else press on to turn on the brightness press again oh okay and this just turns it on or off that's great the toggle turns the mode on switch the toggle to the right to activate horizontal scrolling control dial colors are unique and indicate the current mode yellow stands for horizontal scrolling for example oh okay let's okay let's see if this actually works let's open a page what okay that's pretty cool okay so if I hit FN
F12 oh yeah it's back to volume so there's vertical scrolling volume control brightness control horizontal scrolling and zoom you can turn zoom on and then you can turn all of these on or off so say you just want to cycle between vertical and horizontal scrolling you don't set the volume with this you've got like a goxlr I mean they're dead now but you've got some other kind of media control system in place and you just want vertical hor horizontal scrolling you turn those two
on FN F12 boom you swap between the two that's really cool actually I'm going to try the zoom mode what it's kind of features like that that you don't tend to get with Boutique boards yes you all of a sudden have qmk via and you can do whatever you you want but also I'm lazy and I just want to like tick a switch in an app that tells me hey you've enabled this thing instead of setting up a bunch of macros and doing it myself time to set up key actuations customize the response ped
for each one you can start by adding a new actuation preset select the key you want during the tutorial please select the T key select the color you want to customize your color indicator oh that's neat primary actuation Point can be customized from 0.1 to 4 mm use the slider or enter the exact value what I do love though here is that they've got a little handy visualization for you so let's say I want to set it to one now I see that it's going to apply when I'm about that far deep and if I set it to
four it's further down so that's actually pretty cool and then oh you you can just use the slider Okay cool so we've got our reset Point here and you can change that as well to whatever you want Oh and it visualizes it and everything that's right cuz it's got flash tap which is corsair's version so we can set it to just below there so as long as I come above that point it should reset which is pretty and then rapid trigger oh yeah separate press release sensitivity I'll be honest you
guys this is the sort of thing that me as a non- customizer kind of person is I don't know how much I'd sit here and Tinker with I think that I would probably unbox this keyboard hook it up to my computer and then use it but for everyone who loves this sort of thing which there's a lot of you they let you do just about whatever you want so it's pretty good in that regard what I need to do though is make sure game mode is on because for some reason game mode doesn't start on by default oh yeah I
"can change my polling right now 8,000" "Hertz yeah I mean let's be real 1,000" htz is good enough for the vast majority of people when we're talking about going from 1 millisecond to .125 millisecond yeah that's way faster 100% most of you aren't going to really feel it however if you're gaming and you're playing in fps and you need literally that half of a millisecond or less to determine who's the winner I mean technically that's going to win let's see activate wind lock yes brightness Max yes static
color enforced no actually you know I will keep that on I like it as a good visual indicator to tell you hey you're in game mode now I kind of wish game mode was just enabled by default it does lock out a few Keys like windlock and other macros that you might have so I guess if you're going to go from using macros and something to wanting to play FPS games you'll want to go to game mode but without this on I can't change the polling rate I don't think oh yeah I can higher us pull okay yeah don't show this
ever again I don't care if higher USB pulling raids take more power select anyway one of the other cool things is how it's doing all of this processing to "enable 8,000 HZ polling rates and Flash" tap and all of that stuff without getting super confused is it's got an axon processor on board love to see it now we got a game on it I have to actually try flash tab can't play Counterstrike as much as I'd like to because w w it's banned if we try to use you should be able to disable game mode
and play Counter Strike on this keyboard however I'm pretty sure if you go in with flash tap enabled you'll get a vacban or you'll at least get a warning so just buy or beware be careful that's why they made it so obvious that like yes I am clearly in game mode flash tap is enabled you can jiggle peek guys I wish I had the dynamic cursor that CS2 has wow I suck I haven't played in so long got that guy hey and you know how I got that guy with flash tab if I didn't have flash tab I wouldn't have killed
him that's not true at all and the thing about having a keyboard and a mouse that's just perfectly responsive with 8 ktz it's going to do exactly what you want when you want is this the keyboard for me do I want to get back into competitive Shooters not particularly but is it absolutely a solid choice if you do want to play competitive shooters or you just want like the next part of your IQ setup I think it's a really solid option it sounds pretty good it feels pretty good I can jiggle Peak I
mean I could before cuz I played Counterstrike for like I don't know a couple thousand hours no big deal but if you don't have that capability and you're trying to just get into the scene now this could give you that edge is it going to make you better gamer not exactly but is it going to make sure that you've got the same Edge that everyone else does yes and it'll make sure that you can never blame the peripherals for your poor gaming performance anymore you can only blame
yourself like me right now if you want to pick up the Corsair k70 Pro tkl you can get it with abs key caps for $179.99 but I really think that you should just spend that 10 extra bucks and pay $189.99 for the PBT key caps if this is the keyboard for you I don't know if it's the right keyboard for me but I'll tell you this much it makes me want to play Shooters again thanks for watching this short circuit thanks of course s for sponsoring this video if you want to check it out we'll have
