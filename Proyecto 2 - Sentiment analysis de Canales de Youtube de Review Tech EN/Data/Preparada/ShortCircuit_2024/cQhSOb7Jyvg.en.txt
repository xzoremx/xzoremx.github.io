PC cases are all the same boring black boxes IO out the back no that's where the thermal take Tower 300 comes in there's eight different colors they've cut the corners off and all the io actually comes out the top but I don't want to build in the blue one this looks like a fortnite chug jug I want to build in the pink one Pink's more my color see I was really interested in the tower 300 mainly because I've actually owned the tower 900 twice the tower 100 and I've built in the tower 500 before
but this one I was really attracted to  in look at that a oh it's got a little bit of blue it's got a blue inside oh that looks so awesome it looks like a cotton candy machine looks like that b elfing keyboard so you still got the three glass panels that the Tower series is kind of known for but they've again decided to angle it this way giving you kind of more of a rounded glass effect to it instead of having big pillars in the way and everything is mounted with all of the I/O at the top so your GPU is
going to be vertical and this is an matx case even though it's quite large for a micro case still very excited to get in here I think you just oh it's taped I've actually been a fan of rounded glass style cases for a while now fantech started rounding their glasses doing a take on the classic lean Lee 01 case there we go and I think this one does it very subtle and I actually kind of enjoy this rounded look wow there's a lot of room in here for a micro ITX case let's get all of our mounts out
here beautiful so these are all the plates and the screws to hold everything on as well as in here there's this little plate which can actually replace the front plate and you can put a screen there why because you want to it also apparently comes with a stand which I'm told we have that can mount your computer at a weird angle like this taking up 90% of your desk that's fine though let's uh can you cut that out for front I/O you've got your power button your reset button your mic
headphone jack two USB 3 ports and a USB type-c enough I/O I would like four USB ports but that's kind of just a nitpicky thing for me underneath this it actually comes with thermal takes 2 140 mm fans the airflow design of this case is it takes everything in from the bottom and the sides and the idea hot air rises so they want to shoot it all out the top it's got these thumb screws on the top that they claim are tooless but I'll use a tool just to get it started nope okay we're going all the
way there we go there's that one the other side here oh seems like they're captive that's great and this whole thing just tilts up and this is where you're going to be able to access you know plugging in a USB drive or plugging in your cables bit inconvenient but it gives a really clean look when all the cables just come out the back like this and this whole case is very easy to build in because every single side can just all come apart like this until you're all the way in and oh
my goodness you have like 720° worth of working room to really be able to get in there and plug in your cables wait what 720° yeah because you don't have 360 yes so you would go less which is 720 720 is 2 full circles oh I meant 270 can you cut that out and like I mentioned all the air is meant to come in the bottom here so every little one of these sides has a tiny little dust filter on all of them here here here some at the bottom which can flip that and get at oh perfect just take this out
once a year two years give it a little bit of a wave slot it back in perfect and the back one is even magnetic as well makes it nice and easy to clean these bottom ones a little bit harder to reach at but that's okay let's tuck it back in there what the heck it was bad design totally wasn't user error you have to slide in one side first then it magnets down I was doing it the opposite way it was user error oh wow never mind the whole back panel comes off too dang it's just a shell of itself now it
weighs like nothing all your cables for your front IO one rubber grommet for all the cable management your fans came down the side here power supply mounts at the bottom of this case and then everything can tuck up behind the motherboard just like a traditional PC there's room for two drives back here either 2.5 or 3.5 but if that's not enough storage for you there's actually one more little Mount right here for a 3.5 or a 2.5 I've heard online though that apparently if you
have a full 420 mm radiator here fitting a 3.5 Drive might be a little tough but the fact that you can fit a 420 mm Radiator in an matx case is kind of wild already now that I've torn it all apart it's time to build a PC in it but not before I tell you about our sponsor thanks to LG for sponsoring this video upgrade your home entertainment experience with LG's OLED TVs they have a variety of display types that will fit your needs and budget from the more wallet friendly mid-range B series to
the absolute baller Z series I mean just look at the Z3 8K 77in monster do you need it maybe not does it dwarf what you have right now probably so whether you're a gamer that needs Ultra fast response time or a cinema Enthusiast looking for crystal clear clear picture quality LG's OLED TVs are there to provide depth detail and high resolution on a grand scale check them out today using our Link in the description before I even start not super happy all the screws are just in one baggie that I
just have to sift through in goes our motherboard we got an matx we're going to try to fit as wait I went to put the motherboard in I was putting it the like this way cuz I'm figuring this is the back no the io's got to go at the top we got our matx Asus board here with a ryzen 7900x line it all up oh you might have to be careful about that this standoff is actually not on this motherboard there's no hole right there which means if I had screwed that down I could have shorted the board so
I'm going to have to remove my Center standoff here your motherboard may vary on that but you might want to double  building there we go oh I dropped it I'll get it later there we go now it's resting on all the standoffs oh I forgot  in oh actually never mind it's right there Boop man having this case so open like this makes it just so easy to work in and oh it's great man it's got the radiator support but it's got all the room for a big cooler which one do you  do yeah okay we'll go with
nocta make sure you install your cooler back plate before you put the motherboard in otherwise you got to do a little bit of finagling but two those thumb screws and you can actually remove the hard drive Mount so that's kind of good and then we get all the access to the back panel there oh there we go this is a chonker of a cooler I need to put thermal paste  B all right apparently this case supports up to 210 mm tall coolers which is very large again for a small form factor case and the air flow goes from
bottom up so we're still going to want to position our fan this way it blocks the GPU well that was a fun experiment to see that it will fit the air cooler uh but we're removing it because if you look closely you can actually kind of see that the cooler here is cutting off the GPU Riser so we won't be able to  in you know what feel like I should just go with liquid cooling let's open this up all right now let's take out the removable bracket slide our radiator bracket out dang can fit a lot of
radiator in this bad boy there's also another radiator slot you could take out the fans here and put it up top we're going to pounce it on the side it's going to look a little nicer that way I think the best part about this radiator install boom once you got it in there it's just those two screws again if I wanted to Cable manage it behind it's a little tough there well thankfully take off this radiator just like that this is going to be such a small nitpick but if you're going to go through the trouble of
coloring the inside of your case why can't you color the pcie brackets oh there we goo that might be one of the snuggest  GPU I actually kind of like the look of that time to start closing up some panels here boom hide my lack of cable management all right oh that went that went on super easy oh there's my magnets it's kind of nice actually I didn't even realize that when I took them off man I love this GPU orientation I think it's the reason I love these Tower series so much as gpus have gotten heavier and
heavier they've all started to Sag right when they're on your motherboard there's no sag with this takes all the stress off of it one more thing just before we finish up we got to swap out our front panel you get the screen goes on there two little screw holes that should be nice and easy how does this screen come off oh man all tooless ah oh that looks cute $90 for the screen though maybe not worth it but I think it looks cool one thing I was just going to ask you know how it's bad heebies to
like close the side panel before you boot which side panel there's eight of them there we go oh yeah dang oh man I love this so much we'll see how it looks when it turns on  one moment please moment of Deuce there we go who the screen oh yeah little thermatic logo one thing to point out we actually have these radiator fans pushing out the side here normally on their website they describe it as pulling in the sides pulling in the bottom and then out the top and back but that's how they came
installed on this rad so man I think this is in the end why I just love the thermal take Tower designs it takes your traditional PC and flips it on its side speaking of which for $30 oh it's kind of a chunker you can actually uh lay it oh yeah that looks awesome the $30 kit does come with a color match bottom but we ordered the hydrangea blue one so it doesn't quite match our build I mean we could take the top off that one and put it here if we wanted to and then we got
two blue caps but I think the sideways look is honestly maybe the way to go for this if you have the desk base that's a big ask big desk is what you need to get this working I think it looks really cool on the side though overall I actually really enjoyed building in this but again I might have a little bias building in the tower systems before and being this kind of unique case you're either going to love it or hate it thankfully it does add that customization if you want to go vertical or horizontal for
$150 I think the price is actually totally reasonable personally for a case that definitely had to go under a lot of R&amp;D to make it all work like this having eight different color options is really cool as well you can do so many different kind of themed builds you can maybe make this one like diva from OverWatch or Bumblebee from Transformers I I love the different colors instead of just the typical white and black that we're used to make sure you guys like comment subscribe if you're looking for
another weird case to look at maybe look at the one plof built it was called the P it's like origami kind of weird
