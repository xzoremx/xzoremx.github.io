we're here at CES 2024 except it's not CES and it's not 2024 yet because MSI has brought the show to us early and they sponsor this video we're going to check out a bunch of their brand new laptops and I am super excited about this incredibly specific worlds first this right here is the world's first seamless RGB haptic touch pet we have seen many of those things before but not all of them together so they get the first this laptop is incredibly beastly and I know that because it has a 400 W
charger I have never seen something this powerful before and particularly it's not even that big in the past they have to have two bricks for a laptop like this but not anymore with a power brick that chunky you know that we have some real powerful components in this thing which of course we do an i 94900 HX which is 24 cores two of which can go up to 5.8 GHz and then all of the peak course can go up to 5.2 in a laptop that's this big like it it is heavy if I'm honest it's it's very
far from light but like has that in a 490 into it the total wattage of this thing is 270 watts and I have no clue how they have been able to tame that we'll find out very soon though first it has a cherry keyboard in it could MSI have fixed their keyboard woses I think the sound says it all just can can you hear this like oh yeah oh it's just as satisfying as it sounds this is genuinely a fantastic keyboard and I am really happy that they have it on here but I'm even  apart there we go before you look in
there don't don't look I want to direct your attention to these feet instead of you know just having a small little foot like they have here in the back they got Fancy with it and they have these little mountainous feet with gaps underneath so air can actually go in here around the feet there's much easier ways to do this but I really appreciate that they didn't do those in here we have some really impressive upgrade ability we have three ssd's in here one of them's pcie Gen 5
the other two are Gen 4 and we have four sodm slots so right here we have got our Ram this one right here has a total of 64 GB here we have just a single at 5600 megga transfers per second love to see it there's even some fun little graphite pads in between all of them look at that in here we can also see 99.9 wat battery as is expected in something this large and Wi-Fi 7 but why we actually came in here is this Vapor chamber look at the size of it it goes all the way up here over to there down around the
corner I have never seen a vapor chamber that massive before I thought for a second that it was three Vapor Chambers here here and here but they tell me no it's one Vapor chamber all of this is just shared also have a little chipset cooler there these massive fans look at how thick those are Andrew in here we can see the speakers so we have one woer there one wer on the back I'm not totally sure but I'm guessing it's done so that the force of those two cancel each other out and we have a little
speaker here so your high notes are going to bounce off of your tables into your ear and then it'll sound a lot wider than it just being speakers on the top of a laptop that's my guess though I didn't kill it fantastic they can continue this tour but what they can't continue is me knowing how good their mini LED display is so this will only be coming with ultra D mini LED display at 120 HZ but this engineering sample sadly does not have that panel which is too bad because the best screens that we've
seen this year were mini LED but also the worst one that I saw was also mini LED so we'll see how well MSI does in the future maybe it's good I hope so just kidding turns out we can look at it right now MSI has brought us their new stealth 18 which also features the mini LED panel we were able to figure it out for sure by using a backlight test and being able to see sort of the artifacts that you get from a mini LED panel not that they're really artifacts just some little bit of blooming okay MSI didn't
really want us to do this comparison but we are anyway here we've got their new mini LED panel compared to their OLED panel and the first thing you can notice is just this one is way brighter the mini LED is so much brighter than the OLED but also it is so much less reflective this has a nice m display on it I don't know if you can see like the lights in the background and stuff on the OLED but this right here nothing at all what we can see is a little bit of blooming around like the edges of
objects it isn't just the pitch black like you can see on this OLED but man they have done a really good job with the dimming zones on this mini LED display so uh I'm happy to say that based off my eyeballs without any labs testing or stuff that this mini LED panel will be in the top tiar of what we've been seeing and not those bottom ones once you're done admiring that panel though you are going to be drawn to the speakers they have these incredibly fancy grills down here it's
like the burmister system you'd find in a Mercedes and let's just see how well  done okay not bad not bad same sort of thing two speakers four woofers in this guy right here here and it is pretty darn loud I do have to say this is also a good opportunity to see this mini LED display and like these crabs are just so bright I love it this right here is also in a P3 color space so everything's a little bit over saturated but I'm guessing we can change it to the correct color profile in the menu they're
nodding yes yes we can nice now of course this thing being much thinner and lighter than the Titan is also not quite as powerful have 185 wat TDP but now we have to talk about Intel this right here has the Intel Ultra 9 processor which is series 1 not to be confused with series 14 which they are selling at the same time it is different and apparently on a new process node called Intel 4 which you might think is 4 nanomer but it's actually 7 nanometer but this thing has a bunch of really cool AI stuff in it
and it supports a whole bunch of apps with functions that actually make a lot of sense having AI stuff already built in for let's say upscaling in Lightroom noise suppression and audacity AI green screening and OBS that is really cool they do have like your standard AI features like your noise suppressions and your switching of modes automatically in here too but seeing all that stuff that Intel has integrated into a bunch of other apps makes it feel much more useful to me all of which to
say that they have managed to get an Intel Core Ultra 9 185h and a 490 into a laptop that weighs just 2 let's say 2.8 kg or 6 lb okay 6 lb doesn't sound so light uh again Titan Titan Titan 18-in laptop whole kilogram on it 8.03 PB okay the final thing that MSI is super proud about I am talking just over the moon about with the stealth that they have ambient RGB for the keyboard if you look here not only is there RGB for every single key but if you don't want all of those lit up they have a little strip in
here that gives you ambient light for your keys so if the RGB on each individual key is too bright for you you can still see your keyboard in the dark with just this right here very cool what I think is the coolest though is the new cyborg 14 and it's translucent chassis look at that I absolutely love that companies are having fun with plastics again and this right here is such a neat little guy they have had the cyborg series out for a little bit this is the first time
that it comes with a 14in screen and I think this right here is going to be a laptop that makes a lot of sense to a lot of people this is expected to drop for around $800 they don't have finalized pricing yet and for that you get a 13th Gen processor and a 4 350 this thing right here also is really nice and light where did my scale go we are talking 1.6 kg 32 lb that's actually quite reasonable to have in your backpack it's so cute it's so nice at these laptops that once we're I don't
want to call it cheap cuz it's not cheap but it's pretty inexpensive compared to like the Titan that we have here it feels really good when did MSI get so good at building laptops like like like look I'm actually like reefing on this this is really low in your tear and it's not flexing at all the only metal on this thing is the back panel but they had me fooled thinking that this right here is metal as well it's pretty darn nice this thing comes with a 1200p 144 HZ panel and not the
kind of IO problems that you will see on some other smaller gaming laptops we got USB type A type c display port but doesn't look like Thunderbolt h HDMI 2.1 fulls sizee ethernet and on the other side one more type A and headphone microphone combo Jack I am super excited for final pricing of this thing just like I'm excited show you their professional laptops here we have msi's Prestige laptops which you might have already seen cuz the Embargo already dropped when this releases but I haven't
seen before this my first time seeing them right here we have the prestige 16 and the 13 and the incredible thing about both of these is MSI claim they will each do 16 hours of continuous video playback which is just a crazy amount of time for your battery to last so this this 13-in we we did see this last year but it has a 75w battery in this thing it is only 2.14 lb that's under a kilogram yeah 973 G with a 75w battery and this guy right here has has a 99.9 W hour battery and it is this
thick like I can just hold this with one hand no problem really nice and light and comes with up to a 4070 now it is only a 65 watt TDP on that 4070 and the MSI guys were like oh some people were complain that's really impressive for how thick this thing is like look at how much heat sink they have heat sink there heat sink there there and there around the side and all of this grading so that a laptop of this size can be that powerful this thing comes with a core Ultra 7155 H processor one of the things
that's kind of surprising about this one is just the number of holes in it like we've got emitter emitter that gets you your windows hello facial recognition we have our webcam right there with a nice little shutter and we have two microphones there and one down by the keyboard by having all three of these at once and their fancy AI noise cancellation whatever apparently they're able to figure out who's in front of the laptop to the side of the laptop behind the laptop and you can sort of using Ai
and maths and stuff figure out exactly where the user is and just block out everyone else if you want to or have the allall talk if you feel like it it's AI It's Magic it is a little beast and we've already seen this OLED panel looks fantastic just like it's fantastic that MSI sponsored this video thanks guys MSI also gave us early access to their new gaming handheld the claw msi's brand new first ever Intel Core Ultra powerered handheld gaming PC with a 53w hour battery up to 1 TB of storage an
inclusion of a thunderbolt four port there is a lot to love and be excited about with this bad boy we didn't have much time with the unit before having to return it to MSI since it was one of only two prototypes at the time of filming so we did get to lab test it or go in as depth as we were hoping to but that's only for now stay tuned so we can get a final retail version in hand and get some full coverage on it so if you guys like this video hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day
I'll see you later maybe actually in Vegas next time
