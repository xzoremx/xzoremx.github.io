today we're going to be checking out a thick tablet Meet The Minis Forum V3 a gaming grade tablet that features a ryzen 7 8840 U processor 32 GB of memory and some really cool IO starting with this guy right over here let's get right into this we've got no way no way is that a full-sized SD card slot okay I'm kind of into that we've got a volume rocker that can operate in two different mod modes one to adjust volume and one to adjust yes that's right my friends get this the brightness of the display
when you are using this USBC Port that supports something that I'm seeing for the first time in person here called vlink vlink allows this tablet computer which yes is a full-fledged PC that I'm just going to go ahead and click on that is capable of running even triaa games like cyberpunk it allows you to turn it into a portable monitor I'm such a huge advocate for this functionality because what it does is it allows you to use it as a tablet for most of its usable life
cycle and then use it as a monitor later in fact that is a feature that Apple used to support on their old IMAX called Target display mode so you could just use it as a monitor once the insides were kind of useless uh let's take a quick look at the outsides here so we've got some Pogo pins for oh right it's not just a tablet it's a threein one sold me taking a look at some accessories that'll attach to that coming around this side we've got two more USB C's these both USB 4 we've got a power
button with integrated fingerprint sensing uh moving around to the top ah yes ventilation if you're going to put eight Zen 4 CPU cores in this thing not to mention a 12 cuu GPU that boosts to up to 2.7 GHz you're going to need a couple intake fans and you're going to need a couple of heat sinks man I am liking this display it does not support HDR but what it does manage to do is hit the stated 500 nits of peak brightness with what we would describe as reasonable color accuracy and it's got an extremely I'm
using the word aggressive here but really what I'm going for is effective anti-glare coating that in spite of the fact that this place is covered in studio lighting still manages to yield a usable image it doesn't have the thinnest bezels and we did notice some odd behavior from the display where using it as a Target display for another Machine versus using it with the tablet itself resulted in both different performance in terms of brightness and in terms of color accuracy and grayscale
tracking kind of odd but none of the results were unacceptable so I would take the additional functionality even if it does come with some caveats and caveats there are this is a 144 40p display that can run it up to 165 Hertz I mean look when I said that this was a gaming tablet I was not yank in your chain but in display Target mode it can only achieve 60 HZ and we noticed that instead of running an 8 bit mode natively it was running six-bit mode with dithering which we didn't observe
any banding issues but could show up depending on what it is that you're trying to achieve wow Big Picture Mode looks flipp and awesome on this and wait this isn't 1440p is it it's not it's 2560 x600 so that's a 16x 10 aspect ratio which is great for productivity whether you're a video editor or writer I mean really anything where you can benefit from a little bit of extra vertical space you know what I'm not always a huge fan of the feel of anti-glare Coatings this is not bad it's
still not quite what you'd expect from you know a modern smartphone with Gorilla Glass 3 or victus or something like that but it's pretty satisfying and realistically I don't think there'd be any getting away from this given that ah yes one of the big selling points of this tablet is that it is suitable for drawing right now their pen is included as a free gift with your purchase of the V3 tablet but it is rumored to cost in the neighborhood of around $100 at some point and supports up to
"4,096 pressure sensitivities so can we" play fort Horizon 5 with a pen we're about to find out while we wait for this to launch why don't we tell you about our sponsor thanks ground news for sponsoring today's video they want to change how you engage with news articles from around the world and ground news does this by breaking down biases revealing who owns Which media outlets and showing factuality for each story recently Microsoft delayed their AI recall feature due to security concerns
thanks to ground news you can ask why right leaning Outlets might report on the lay through a more critical lens plus their blind spot feature shows stories that have little or no reporting from one side of the political Spectrum honesty and transparency should be important when you read the news so why wait save 40% on ground news's Vantage plan at the link down below H yes the answer expectedly is no but that's fine because that gives us a good opportunity to talk about some of the accessories
that are included that we kind of glossed over before there's a power adapter which you can't take for granted these days wow that is really small is this a powered it is 65 Watts Max and so tiny I love this and it comes with a USB C Toc cable the pen comes with an extra tip and a puller and a convenient place to store it though it should be noted that we found that while gaming which is where I was getting to with this it gets really hot because it overlaps ever so slightly with these exhaust vents so we
would recommend that if you're playing games or realistically doing anything intensive for a long period of time on this thing that you maybe just put your pen in your bag and then bring it out when it's time to actually draw for our part though let's try out some more of the accessories ooh the stand oh I guess  better this is this is really not that convenient do I really have to oh wow that's a that's a really stiff hinge dang goes over the camera and that goes like that that's technology all right
oh let's see if the keyboard's a little better man I mean that's about as good as I could ask for for something so low profile but I can't say that it's the most awe inspiring typing experience I've ever had wait a second where the Sam Hill do they pull in air from is there another air pull source it appears that the intention ah is that actually holds on there a little bit better too all right minis Forum touche I got to say I'm surprised it took so long for someone to put one of
these mobile AMD chips into a tablet like obviously at this screen size 800p is going to look a little Alias but this is very usable and in a chassis this size I don't know if this is just credit to to the mini forum team which has a lot of experience building super small desktop PCS it is surprisingly quiet like look at this I'm holding this right up to the mic you can barely hear the flipping thing that's really impressive running a AAA game like Port of horizon 5 now what
you might not be as impressed by is the battery life it's got a 50w hour battery in it which is an okay size but resulted in an endurance battery life test of about 5 hours well short of our Target of about 6 hours to be decent and gaming battery life of just over an hour regardless of the performance profile speaking of performance profiles I'm probably in the balanced performance profile right now because the fans do get a bit more aggressive in the 28 watt maximum profile let's get their
application open so we can have a look at that yeah we're in Power Balance mode oh oh I got to plug it in for power premium mode that is a very short included power cable so this is not also a regular USBC Port well that's good to know looking over here hey there we go 28 watt TDP 165 HZ refresh mode there we go that's a few more fpss and it's still not even that loud I think the most impressive thing about these AMD mobile chips is just how long it's taking Intel to catch up to them
like they technically have a competitor in the form of their core Ultra 100 series family but I mean we have a competing product from 1 x player that has a larger 60 plus wat hour battery it's got the competing core Ultra chip running at a maximum 35 watt TDP instead of 28 watts and it still doesn't manage to match the performance of this thing and AMD hasn't even updated the GPU in these for an entire product refresh one thing they have updated is their npu or their neural Processing Unit so they
saying that your onboard radon Graphics can now be used for things like gaze correction when you're on conference calls automatic Framing and advanced background adjustments uh speaking of which we should probably have a look at this camera I was going to say that's not bad for having an anti-glare Coating in front of it but um it doesn't that does impact my impressions of a little bit I mean it's very usable and I'll let you guys be the judge of the microphone quality eye contact hello can I have eye
contact with you guys no matter where I'm looking on my screen is it correcting it uh it really doesn't look like it automatic framing though is this is any of this doing anything is oh heyy there you go whoa buddy okay that's kind of cool I haven't actually played around with this wait a second we're not done with the camera yet there's a rear camera so you can be the supremely gigantic pad hole ever oh my God the quality of this is terrible I don't remember the last time I took a picture
with something and it looked this bad this is like iPhone 4 grade I can't even tell what finger you're holding up yeah okay all right all right all right all right we get the point back to the front camera for a second though it supports Windows hello which is nice and I got to say the overall weight of the device is not that bad it's about a kilogram which is heavy obviously but thanks to the magnesium alloy chassis it's not nearly as heavy as it otherwise could have 
been not bad actually not very loud but they've done a good job of managing Distortion even if you're not going to be getting the most Soul thundering base out of this thing you know what I don't even need to launch this to tell you guys the labs tested the gaming performance of this device and we were pretty impressed it does about as well as you would expect one of amd's latest apus to do and leaves Intel struggling to look for a reason to exist exist in this gaming tablet gaming handheld space
what they couldn't test was how well it works for art now see I happen to be something of an artist I'm just kidding realistically whatever they did to have a look at the pen performance is more useful than what I'm about to do but hey I can at least say if it's super laggy he hey look at that okay can I just say mad respect to anyone who does a daily or even a weekly strip because anytime I sit down and try to think of something  blank come on that's a little bit funny
I mean realistically all I really care about is what kind of finess of control do I have with this thing it is possible to make contact with the screen and not leave a mark which is sort of a bummer however even the slightest bit of pressure does leave a very very thin line oh something that I'd like to try though is using it in Target display mode we're going to be using a Nintendo switch let's go ahead and get this plugged in here external DP signal detected shut down and switch to tablet
mode yes do you confirm all your work has been saved that makes sense I've got to turn off the computer oh now is a good time to mention that we did find that it managed full coverage of the dcp3 color space as advertised however you're going to want to turn on windows's autocolor Management in order to make sure that regular SDR content doesn't end up oversaturated now let's left to do is turn on our switch oh wow this is interesting it is stretched is there an OSD that allows us to change the aspect
ratio okay that doesn't adjust volume anymore okay as we discussed that does brightness well is there any other OSD oh that is nope that just turned it off that is a bummer I pressed the power button and it turned the computer back on which was not actually my desired outcome when I had the switch plugged into it so it's an unusual device the one thing that I haven't been told in advance of this unboxing is the price I'm going to guess it's pretty cool it comes with a lot of accessories I'm
going to say this thing is probably "going to cost you a cool ,000 1500"  us okay apparently it's on promo for "1,200 right now they know about the iPad" right no they haven't heard of the iPad I mean this is a different device and if you're the kind of person who wants to run Windows software you want a tablet you want something AMD powered you're not going to have a whole ton of options and I understand that when you're producing devices at lower volumes there's going
to be some inherent overhead but I think it's going to be a very particular customer who goes with this over one of the other mobile Computing solutions that are out there even if honestly it does seem pretty darn cool to me hope you guys enjoyed this video subscribe to Short Circuit
