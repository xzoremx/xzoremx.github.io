yeah mini LED monitors are pretty sweet but they're expensive that is until Brands like karui decided to make one with decent specs for under $400 that's right on paper this monitor's got it all 27 in 144p 240 HZ HDR 1000 and 384 local dimming zones for way less than the competition and the best part is this stand is so cool but what we all want to know is is it any good response times are decent enough viewing angles are meh but these 384 damning zones are putting in some work
but if you don't need all those frames AOC has one for even less with just 60 fewer Hertz what do you think would you take a risk on these budget Brands like karui
