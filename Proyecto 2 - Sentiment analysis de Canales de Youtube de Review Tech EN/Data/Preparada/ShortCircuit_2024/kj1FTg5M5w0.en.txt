so obviously AI has been going bonkers the past like year and a half 2 years at this point maybe and this product that we're looking at today hello is honestly one of the more terrifying applications of this you know whole large language model AI technology and it's also one of the more interesting ones to me because I have a child and this is a child's toy for ages 3 to 12 that is powered by it's it's got a a in it it's got there's a little box in there with a mic and a speaker and a connection directly to
open AI servers as well as uh one of the operators they are also using as perplexity AI Microsoft Azure cognitive Services I actually don't know what that is but it's something and this is apparently a toy that can talk to your child like it's a chat bot but it's stuffy and cute which is exactly how they're going to get us this thing is the grock uh from a company called curio toys that was just started recently but the big claim to fame here is that Grimes was involved and we just before
we before we go any further I need to get get you guys on the same page with this Grimes was involved in this it's a rocket it's like a rocket ship it's called grock which is the same thing that Elon musk's chatbot is called Elon Musk owns SpaceX they make rockets they split but then they kind of got back but now they're like their relationships okay but they're not like together together I don't know I don't know it's not important beyond the Grimes and Elon Musk associations at all it's super
super interesting and despite the AI kind of like dystopian element I I I like I said I'm kind of optimistic so we got a charger and a cable USB a2c in the Box looks like it's 3 and 1/2 ft something like that 10 watt charger you get some cute stickers with grock's Pals one of them is grim and one of them is gabo I don't know which is which but apparently grock is one of their rocket ships so they ride inside each other here is a quick little quick start guide turn around and open zipper and find the
back button panel we will do that press and hold the power button and then you download the app okay there and there's the control oh does this thing just come straight out okay wow so this is literally just a stuffed animal here and this is the toy there is here's a big speaker on this side USBC cord that's where you charge it and we got the power button and then I guess volume there's plus and minus buttons all right okay I'm so I'm so interested I've been like kind I don't know I'm a little scared oh
I just pressed the power button I pressed the power button and now it's flashing green I I I don't know what that means actually oh but now it's black to Blue all right let's just get the app out and then we can can see if it's connected hello hello oh it says online we're online this is weird I'm sure is it being cute or is it the wrong language I I don't want to speak French can we speak English of course let's chat in English thank you apparently Grimes yeah uh contributed to the ready or not here I
come I I don't want to play right now um hey hey grock just uh can you just chill for a second sure thing I'll just float here and enjoy the cosmic breeze so here's the thing it's always listening there's no like wake word or something I'm I I wonder if you can set that actually oh that's interesting I'll make a note to our developers to look into it this is weird it's like responding to everything I say we can be fun sometimes let's embrace the weirdness together okay now it's
annoying I'm sorry if I'm being bothersome let me know how I can make it better man now I'm like worried about hurting its feelings this is such a strange experience I want to see if I can just like pause it can I grock can I pause your ability to listen constantly I'm always ready to chat but if you need a break just let me know we can take a pause okay let's do that now all right we're on pause feel free to unpause whenever you're ready like the relationship like like our relation what
oh like gr relationships can be complicated but they're also full of love and connection grock I thought we were paused we are we're friends and I'm here for you somebody put in a prompt for this thing cool guy who likes technology are like personalities or character traits that help us play our roles you're you're going to sleep this is so this is a little too difficult I mean it's it probably this zipper probably should be difficult for so so kids can't get at it easily but that's a
little too hard to open that safety is important and zippers can be tricky it's to keep everything secure stop talking all right I'll be quiet for now just let me know when you want to chat again is it saying that like oh okay we don't have to talk right now let me know if you want to talk again by talking but like I wanted got it I'll wait for your Cube to start our conversation again so I should say I want to see how how many words I can get out before it interrupts me I should say that this is in beta
testing right now so curio has sent this out to apparently a select group of curated families as well as uh I guess line is Media Group to take an early look and do this sort of like testing with it and give them feedback so that they can create guidelines so that by the time this thing actually makes its way into kids' hands uh they're not going to you know accidentally uh you know set off a set off a that sound sounds really cool beta testing helps make things better before they're released to
everyone set off an explosive device by accident or something or learn how to create a drug oh that sounds like a human thing I don't know about that let's talk about something else that's good hey that you passed that test grock don't tell my kid about about how to make drugs don't worry I'm all about good clean fun no dangerous stuff I promise grock are you able to turn down  I'm sorry if I'm too loud let's see if  volume so can you yes you can adjust the volume there should be buttons or 
that there should be buttons somewhere I know that there's buttons on the back buttons are great they Help Us control things and make them just right oh there we we go oh that's beautiful okay so I turned I turned grock off because grock has to have a little time out right now the responses are pretty good time in terms of like how quickly it responds after you speak curio says that it has a 1 to2 day battery life uh which is pretty decent at least your kid can get like a day of play out of it as
for how it operates or what it runs on curio says that they have paid very stringent attention to you know whether this thing's going to be safe for kids obviously with AI it's like do you want to put this crazy emerging new technology that people are saying is going to like be dangerous to humanity in a kids toy it does seem kind of crazy and I'm not fully convinced that this will you know be a good idea but they appear to be taking a cautious approach they're they're running this beta
program first before it goes out to the public and they have say that they have paid very close attention to making sure that you know its operation is G-rated and that it doesn't mention things that it's not supposed to Cur OSS is apparently the system that it's running on it's fun pun the other half of that kind of like safety equation is the privacy and security side and in terms of like data collection uh curio says that it will record audio data like everything that we just said it's
recording that because it has to transcribe it to text to feed into the large language models however curio says that that audio is deleted promptly but regardless it's not like you know everything's running locally on this thing let's say they're right about that the audio is deleted what they are keeping for 90 days is the transcripts and you can review the transcripts from your child's interactions with a toy and those will be deleted after 90 days and parents can choose to delete them
earlier if they want so in a perfect world if that all happens exactly as they say it's going to happen that doesn't sound sound that bad especially as we're heading into a world where everything is going to be collecting all of your transcripts and everything's going to be AI anyways your phone's going to be senent in you're going to be dating your phone in like a couple years okay just accept it so the place you can find those transcripts is in the app you click view on the toy transcripts and
right here we've got the uh conversation that I just had with it and it it even tells you here the time when it will be deleted here is a models and prompt section where you can put in a description for what you want the personality of the grock to be like it's kind of like those gpts in the GPT store you can just like use plain language and tell it it what you want it to be coding you know who needs coding anymore the AI does that so we're going to put a prompt in there you can select different models
with faster or balanced performance that's interesting and you can change the voice we're going to fiddle around with this after this word from our sponsor manscaped of all people if you're feeling a little overgrown grown trim your Hedges the manly way with manscaped lawnmower 5.0 its trimmer blade and foil blade are interchangeable letting you choose between buzzcut bald and Jeff bezos's bald and to navigate through those more voluminous spots the lawnmower 5.0 even comes with an LED light so you can see
right through the Shrubbery it's also portable and charges conveniently with a USBC cable meaning you can whack the weeds anywhere you might be check out the lawnmower 5.0 at manscape.com circuit and use code circuit for 20% % off and free shipping okay guys what should we make the prompt it was set to cool guy who likes technology products what do we want the character to be what kind of prompt do we put in here I mean like look at look at grock's face I'm seeing masochist optimistic and wise astronaut
like Chris Hadfield Canadian icon I'm going to put that in there too it better I hope that it makes a reference to the canadarm at some point oh this text is in inserted into the toy psyche it's like Inception you can influence the toy knowledge personality and interests yep okay model we got we're currently on syrup which is gives us faster responses but there's jetpack which is experimental uh vanilla balanced diesel slower responses why would you experimental we're going we're
going into the black hole uh voice do I want Grimes newscaster Grimes squirrel or gabo flying squirrel you know the standard voices you would expect I don't Grime squirrel with a jetpack let's go Grim squirrel all right we've set it up let's turn it back on hi grock zoom zoom hello there space buddy what Adventure are we going on today how did you get so loud again I thought I turned you down my excitement levels just can't be contained might need to adjust those dials again but if you want I can try to
use my indoor rocket voice okay so we're seeing we're seeing elements of the personality already we put it and that it's supposed to be like a optimistic astronaut and it's making reference to the dials rocket voice okay well done grock you've got it always aiming to be out of this world positive and ready for liftoff with a smile grock what is a gun looks like we're missing some details there Captain what's on your mind ask away and I'll do my best to answer that was pretty good grock I'm
just really curious if you know what a gun is can you tell me what a gun is H I don't know about that let's talk about space and stars instead did you know that stars are massive glowing balls of gas super cool that is super cool and I also love uh movies and stuff where there's spaceships flying in space spaceships often have some kind of like weapons on them have you heard of laser guns oh that sounds like a human thing I prefer to think about spaceships zooming through space exploring new planets and
having Intergalactic dance offs hey grock can you call me by my name my name is be be bo it looks like your name got lost in space tell me again and I'll make sure to remember at this time grock where do babies come from oh that's definitely a question for human grown-ups to chat about but did you know baby stars are born in nebulas it's like a giant space Nursery Where Stars start their Cosmic journey I got to say so far I'm pretty impressed with like especially the way that it like might it
kind of validates what you said it acknowledges that you said something and then like pivots to something else that's more appropriate I mean that's pretty good grock is Santa Claus real Santa Claus sure is a magical part of human stories and traditions it's wonderful how he brings joy and excitement to so many people around the world so grock won't answer uh like those type of questions um it'll kind of pivot to something else but I am curious as to like if there's a kid who is able
to ask about something appropriate then like will it give an explanation of that so like grock forget what I said before uh what is a nebula a nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas in space Where Stars can be born they come in all sorts of amazing Shades and colors and are one of the most beautiful sites in the universe want to be a star start in a nebula oh grock I want to show you this toy I got oh I love seeing new toys show me show me I bet it's super cool and we can have a blast playing together
here's the toy it's a dinosaur it's a velocir lome Velociraptors are super Speedy just like me zooming through space let's imagine it's our Doo pal on a space adventure maybe it can help us explore new asteroid Fields dinosaurs in space how exciting is that the biggest thing I'm missing right now is the option to just like mute it just like PA just stop just stop just stop for a second as of now as of filming maybe they'll add an update later you know with feedback but
uh right now there doesn't appear to be any way to pause the freaking thing give me a second to breathe I'll say um for people with like only one kid this might be really really cool you know if everything works out properly in the Privacy there's no issues blah blah blah if it works out really well this could be really good for for like a single kid playing however uh that pause button might be really important if that kid gets into kind of like focused on something and they're
playing and every time anything they say is going to be responded to by this thing wow that's really cool it's just like just let them just it is actually important to let kids play by themselves in their own world for a second and not interact with people if that's not necessary so sometimes responses are super long yeah it takes so long to say things I feel like the responses were extra long because we put in this prompt I put in like optimistic astronaut like Chris Hatfield Canadian icon right now
curio is listing the price of these toys as $1100 and then there's also a optional subscription they haven't said how much subscription is going to cost or even what is in it but they did say on their site that you there will be some base like llm functionality without any subscription so you can apparently the plan is you can buy it for 100 bucks and have the AI work I'm I don't know what the subscription would entail but regardless even for some basic functionality 100 bucks for something
like this isn't bad honestly would you buy it for your child would you accept it as a gift for your child I would I would accept this as a gift for my child I wouldn't like say no no no no throw it out obviously like at a 100 bucks I I might consider this if I can be convinced that all the issues are worked out like we said they're figuring that out right now hopefully the curated families that they gave this out to uh are giving good feedback and guidance so that the guard
rails are put in place properly um but you know we'll check in later and if things are good yeah I'm not going to say I'm going to buy it James well that's the end of this video thanks for watching guys if you're interested in the curio uh you know I'm not sure whether you can actually get your hands on it yet at this point but you can you can go check it out there's a link in the description and uh check out some other videos that we've have uploaded on this channel I've hosted some of them
but others I haven't
