I've got to be honest with you I'm tired of covering all these heavy EVS some of them are great but even the best ones are just masking their weight instead of actually removing it which is why here today Miata this right here is one of the lightest cars on the market at 2374 lb and man we have had a heatwave for the last two weeks that I've had this it has been fantastic let's have a   what we have right here is the 2024 model otherwise known as the nd3 so that's the third facelift of the fourth
generation and it is fantastic you can tell that it's the nd3 because we have a little radar sensor right here that gets us our adaptive cruise and the headlights are more newer looking and mostly just the same popping the hood we have the real MVP of the show meaning the minimum viable power this right here is a 2 L 4 cylinder engine with a compression ratio of 13 to1 which is pretty darn high but for Mazda these days this is skyactive G and their Sky Active X has much higher compression
ratios and more power and it's kind of just better but this thing is still pretty darn good in here we also have the optional strut brace that comes with the sport package or the higher trims can also see just how far back the engine is from the line of the wheels which really helps with handling and this thing sh do handle moving around to the side you can tell that we have the GT trim CU we have 17in rims with the diamond cut Edge rate here these do look pretty good but I personally think
they're the worst looking that are available I'd recommend just getting the lower trim you get better looking wheels and it's cheaper moving over here just look at how low this thing is you are beneath every single person on the road besides Dan you can lock and unlock your doors by just pressing right there nice and easy and if you look these doors are really big the door actually stops right about here but then for just fun making it look cool reasons there's all of this
it does make it kind of difficult to get in and out sometimes when you have to  like but overall it's fine as long as you don't have mobility issues rear tires are the same we've got the square setup and moving over to the trunk it's not particular ularly large you can press right here open it up there's a decent amount of space but the problem's going to be just fitting stuff in as long as you can get in this hole it's going to be good there's a fair bit of space but the hole can be a problem in
here we also have a tire repair kit a little light and if you happen to be wondering the soft top does not interfere with your trunk space at all you can put that up and down and will not affect whatever you have in the trunk back here we also have two antennas this one's for your cell phone and GPS the this one is for FM radio normally you don't see two antennas on cars anymore because this FM radio one will be integrated in your back glass but as you can see there is no glass
back here and also they have a backup camera which has been here since 2019 and it's still just as ugly back here we also have the dinki little dual exhaust say it's for weight savings and we also have updated LED lights for the back which they look pretty cool I guess hoing into the driver's seat you can see that I have just enough room I am SI foot tall and I fit perfectly the seat is all the way back and I'm I'm pretty questionable if we get in a rollover but may maybe I'll be fine if you're 62 63
that's probably when you're going to start having issues depending on your leg to Upper torso area if you're maybe a bit taller yeah right right around there you'll start having some big problems well as the driver I have just enough space the passenger gets just enough space minus a little bit you can see they have a great big hump down here that's where the catalytic converter is and also the cup holder is just hanging out right here but it has a Nifty little trick look at this boom you can just
take it out and move it back there now being able to move your cup holder between two spots does sound like a pretty neat idea but it has a fatal flaw if you look at it it acts a lot like a spring if you want to store things besides two small cups you don't have a whole lot of options we have one little spot right here where I was able to fit my glasses and garage door opener that's about it and also we have a tiny little bit of storage back here where we have the owner's manual and a microfiber
cloth that's just about filled it and a little Miata so cute and that's about it for storage there's nothing in the doors there's no glove box right here and there is a little spot where you'd think that your phone would go but mine mine doesn't really I've just been putting it across like this it's fine enough but if I get a bit too into the corners it has ended up in the passenger seat storage aside though this is a really great spot to be these seats are very comfortable
we have the leather ones in our top trim package even though I personally would kind of like the raros everything just feels nice apparently they have a tiny bit extra padding in the middle here this year and it is quite comfortable the steering wheel feels great the whole just driving position feels good we have climate controls that just look at this how hot you want it how much you want the fan to go where you want the heat to go it's very simple and wow who would have ever thought that this system just
works really great what works medium great is the infotainment if you want to use Mazda stuff you need to use this little dial down here it's pretty satisfying even if you do have to kind of T-Rex arm to get at it but you're just going to spend most of your time in Android AO or apple carplay anyway and that works fantastic but you do have to make sure that you have enabled touchscreen while moving because otherwise you have to use this dial which honestly is so freaking dangerous
it took me a little while to find that setting and man using this to go through Android auto when it's not made for a dial terrible time I really like how they have the body color along the side here even if our Arrow gray of this one is pretty darn boring ing I really want a fun collar for a fun car like this instead of just normal putty ass looking 2024 stuff but that said everything that you want is here you've got steering wheel you have your shifter that is just right there we have got our parking
brake which is an actual parking brake instead of those stupid little buttons and I just want to drive it now Andy this is a gas car can we put a bunch of water in the exhaust pipe and rev it wow what a segue to our sponsor War Thunder thanks to War Thunder for sponsoring this video If you want to get behind the wheel of some of the most iconic war machines of all time and cause utter destruction to your surroundings look no further than War Thunder it's a free-to-play cross-platform online military vehicle

look I now have a roof over top of me it is incredibly fast and it's just as fast going the other way it's super nice if you're about to go on the highway or maybe you'll get a bit too buffeted to be able to just floop rip it right up and then you don't have to worry about too much wind in here and vice versa now in their notes that they sent to us Mazda Canada made sure to tell us that it is pronounced Mazda not Mazda like it is in the United States and I'm saying that because I'm very sorry for this 
Canada this thing is quite a bit of fun it has a 0 to 60 of 5.5 seconds which is really quite rapid but after that you can definitely feel that there isn't quite enough power we have 181 horsepower 151 lb feet of torque and it is just enough like I said before it is the minimum viable power even though this is very much not a power kind of car now that we're moving here you can see that my hat just wants to take off I'm just under where the wind is going but like right on my forehead is where
it hits so if I go just a tiny bit higher yeah it wants to pull it off which is why I got a hat that has a little string right here highly recommended overall though as long as her head's not sticking out the top we are able to do full a roll in here and it's completely fine with the top down and even up until about 110 120 km an hour it's pretty decent in here after that though put the top up of course this is a Miata so you don't care too much about a straight line speed you
want to get into the corners and man does this thing ever deliver this is one of the best handling cars that I've ever experienced maybe the best and on top of that it is just so much fun we have the billstein dampers on this which are pretty great but honestly I kind of just want the stock ones because I really appreciate the body Ru let's just dip her in here man we have a near perfect 50/50 weight distribution the RF actually is perfect from 50/50 and oh the way that you can just Huck it into a
corner you don't even have to worry about breaking cuz it just you aren't going fast enough anyway and it Corners so good there are multiple things that make this an absolute blast in the corners but one of the main one is the pedal feel these have some of the best brake feel that I have experienced in a modern car where instead of it just linearly going down and keeping on going this kind of goes a bit and then it just has a little bit of of extra Force so you can just get those excellent heel toes
and it is an absolute joy and of course the other thing that is excellent is the amount of weight like we said at the start Mazda has put just so much effort into taking weight out of this thing that is truly incredible I was one of the people that did recruiting for Baja and University and I can tell you that it is very very difficult to get Engineers to actually focus on stuff like that every single person wants to make a fast car but once they learn that making a Fast Car means just going to
every single bolt and being like Oh does this bolt need to be as big does this connection need to be as big there's a couple grams there everyone gets really bored and drops out I can tell you that for a fact Mazda has not and I really appreciate that my personal favorite weight saving thing here is the transmission un almost every other transmission you will see a bunch of ribs around it that adds rigidity and strength whereas this right here they're able to just change the
thickness of the walls to give it that strength that it needs even though it did have a little bit of a problem with braking but that was fixed in 2019 have I mentioned that we have a manual transmission yet it is one of the highlights of this car the shifter is attached directly to the gearbox and you can really tell because it is just ripping around all the time I love how it's just shaking just being like grab me shift me do it do it come on and man is it satisfying to use without
great big shifter cables going up to the front of your car or any of that nonsense it is just so direct so great feeling I love it I I really do love the transmission GES thing I've heard  correct that is excellent I did complain a little bit about the engine earlier but that said it does do all of its jobs really really really well so many modern engines will ruin a good transmission with an annoying thing called rev hang that is when you put in the clutch but your revs stay up for a little bit of
time for Missions reasons this right here though you put in the clutch immediately starts dropping it probably helps if there's no turbo on this it is enough power and the aftermarket will take care of you if you want more I am the kind of person that would buy just a slightly older one I would keep on going older until it was cheap enough that I could afford this car and a turbo kit for it and I would have an absolute blast doing all of that but I don't think that Mazda should be the ones to
do it now we have been listening to the sound of the engine which could really use a new muffer but what if you want to hear the sound of the sound system well it is quite great play crab rave on title in here we have the nine- speaker sound system from Bose so we have two in the doors Two up on the pillars and two in the the back of the seats but most importantly we have a sub down in the passenger footwell and it is fantastic now I did measure it and interestingly you get more treble with
the windows up and you also get noticeably more Bas when you have the soft top up that said though even with a soft top down you get extension down to the 40 HZ range and overall it is just it is a bang in Sy that's good exceeds expectations for sure you can be ripping down the highway and it does get loud enough one thing that's new for 2024 is adaptive cruise which I just absolutely love having a manual transmission but being able to not worry about people in front of you
slowing down and having to take off cruise control I just love adaptive cruise and this is an excellent implementation of it there also is Lan keep assist in this but it hasn't been annoying me which is pretty rare for those good job on both now there are some times where this is not so perfect I have wanted to take more than one friend to a place or a girlfriend and a dog and was not able to and also just the problem is so much of driving is not down some ideal back road or nice beach
front most of it is down big straight roads like this one where you're just just smelling the smells of every single diesel around you or just the engine of every single car and it is not the most pleasant experience also if you have allergies being open to the elements is going to leave you sneezing quite a bit but that said you can just come in here pop this up rip her down and like we said before it is super quick and then it becomes really quite nice and quiet in here you hear that beep barely those
roads aside though man man this has been enjoyable to have for the last couple of weeks haven't seen any rain though one of my favorite things about this car is that with its power and its composure I could give it to literally everyone that I know and it's going to be totally fine I don't have to worry about them destroying the clutch I don't have to worry about them spinning out and killing themselves every single person that I know can learn how to drive a manual and have an excellent time in
this thing and I just applaud Mazda for everything that I have done here but that said would you daily it Andy not really no no everyone's like it's a burgain but it's only a bargain if you're looking for a second car it is a perfect second car it is the perfect second car which I guess does bring us to the price this one right here as spec is the top trim it comes in at "$42,000 Canadian and for a single car" that's not too bad but for a second car is kind of getting up there which I
think means we need to start bullying Mazda drivers again uh there was this wonderful time where everyone was like oh that's that's a Barber's car oh are you Barbie and you're M up we should do more of that cuz I want to buy an "NA they're freaking $110,000 for one" that's not rusted out and I want one really bad this right here has been an excellent experience I have loved driving this car my arm is sore from just waving at everyone that goes past all of the other Miata drivers except for NC drivers they
just got a next day Alex here I got so distracted by that anatomically correct transmission that I forgot to tell you about one of the biggest improvements to the 2024 Miata and it is the limited slip differential in the back when you're going around a corner or putting down traction if you have an open differential just one of your tires is going to spin you'll have the one tire fire very bad time if you want to try and go fast so we have a limited slip differential in here to prevent that it
locks the two wheels together and that is fantastic problem is on the last ones it would lock the same under braking and acceleration which meant that sometimes if you're to Trail brake into a corner it would get a little bit squirly and if you Florida coming out of a corner same sort of thing little bit squirely for 2024 we have an asymmetrical limited slip differential which has more force between the tires when you're breaking and less when you're you're accelerating so it's a bit stronger on breaking to
make it so that you're more stable and it's a bit looser on acceleration so that again you are more stable and I have to say in highspeed Corners I am shocked at how good this thing is I haven't driven the other ones to compare to but this one fan freaking tastic this thing it truly is excellent just like you are excellent huge thanks for watching this video seriously hit like this re here needs to get views for us to do more gas cars Smash It smash hard right now do it please and have a
fantastic all day I'll see you later we have a peel Andy we save this peel just for you hit like do it
