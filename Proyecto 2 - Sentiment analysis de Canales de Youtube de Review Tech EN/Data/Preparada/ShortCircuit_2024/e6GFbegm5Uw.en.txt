a couple of months ago I looked at a different 32-in 4K QD OLED panel and I've got to say I liked it so much I bought it now MSI has sponsored this video for me to take a look at the mpg 321 urx 4K 240 HZ QD OED Monitor and I've got to say it looks really impressive and there's one or two features that really have me wondering if I made a huge mistake first of all it's flat if you can't tell from just how not enormous this box is um yeah this is not the curved version but
instead the nice flat version that a lot of you have been clamoring about ever since C OLED gaming monitors came out a few years ago that's probably the biggest thing that a lot of people aside from the ultrawide only options that people were upset about I don't want a curved panel I want a flat panel well at long last you can have your choice we got our quick start guide we've got the base of our operation here base of our monitor we'll take that out right now actually why not just get it out of the
package too bad we've got a usbb to a cable for hooking up our monitor to our computer for whatever peripherals we might want to plug in we've got our Ultra highspeed HDMI 2.1 cable very nice I like the all black look this looks really beefy too A lot of the time this back plate that you're going to click clack into the monitor is really small um this looks like it can you know has has a little bit of extra support but uh I guess we'll see probably doesn't need it you know it's
fine these things aren't that heavy behind this little foam sheet we've got the rest of our monitor which is you know actually one of the big things I like is when they've got a nice little perforated slit right here so you can peel it back and then click clack pull it out uh we don't have that so you know I could probably get this in here we can we can get it in just going   yeah yeah I should have attached the  thinking it's not that heavy but when you're holding it kind of awkwardly like
this and then trying to screw something  it here we go I got to say it looks really nice it's all blacked out nice and thin you've got this the it's a small issue but on OLED panels the panel itself is super thin right but then you've got like the control box and whatever Cooling in the back here and so it's like it feels fragile when you're just touching this pot and the rest of it is so bulky anyway it's like why not just make a little box go all the way around like it doesn't it's here anyway
just make it go to the edge I don't know some of you might like the thinness I'm not crazy about it one thing a lot of you might appreciate is that there's not a ton of branding we've got the MSI dragon on the back little MSI logo on the back and then on the front just a small MSI logo on the front here nothing to Major no big symbols anywhere or like all the way across the bottom or in the corners or anything so that's cool as for the I/O there's a few pleasant surprises and one small disappointment
we've got our headphone jack two HDMI 2.1 ports display port 1.4 USB type-c usbb two usba a ports and then a c14 power connector on the back over here you might be wondering to yourself does this USBC Port offer something like 90 WS power delivery and display port alt well it does it's a small feature but it's something that's really appreciated more and more these days as we collect more and more devices that connect through USBC uh it's really handy to just have a laptop or something and just
plug it in through USBC all of a sudden this is your secondary display and guess what it's charging at the same time wow 90 Watts that's a lot of power that one minor disappointment I mentioned it doesn't have display port 2.1 which offers significantly more bandwidth now admittedly there's only a few graphics cards out right now that even have 2.1 but it's a feature that a lot of people are clamoring for with these high-end panels especially when they're running 4K 240 HZ that's a lot of bandwith to
actually use that without having any kind of display stream compression involved and so it's just a nice to have you're probably not even going to worry about it you're not going to be able to use it but I would love to see it here as for the rest of the construction and the stand it's not bad it's got the rotation on the base which is nice to see I would like a slightly more but that's good enough can we we can't go portrait but let's be real it's 4K 240 HZ 32 in I don't I
don't think you're going to put this in portrait mode um and then we've just got a little bit of play here it's not bad definitely enough to get most people and how is the height adjustment okay I would love I would love just a little more I would love to let the monitor go basically to the base down here but we're talking about what an extra inch and a half of distance it's fine it's totally fine and then on the back here we've got a fanless graphine cooling solution so this thing should stay super
quiet as for navigating the OSD it's not quite on the bottom it's a bit on the back here so you're just going to have to reach a little bit further we've got one navigation nipple and then how many buttons one two buttons yeah two little buttons on the back as you can see here it is nice and flat nice and thin and our bezels aren't actually that big either so it's probably going to look pretty good turned on speaking of which all right monitor's on looks pretty good HDR has turned on this thing supports
both true black 400 as well as an HDR Peak 1000 mode it's also rated by vesa for their new clear Mr rating with "13,000 which is just I think as high as" it goes right now it makes sense because not only does OLED have basically instant pixel response times but 240 HZ is fast and so it's going to be Crystal Clear basically all the time they're honestly going to have to invent another rating because all of these really high refresh rate OLED panels are starting to hit the Max uh clearr rating that vesa
created just recently it's already capped out 1080p no no no we want 4K so we can get our sweet sweet 140 PPI whether you're watching it in true black 400 or you're watching it in Peak 1000 it just is absolutely insane how good HDR looks when you've got the right panel to match it now we do have our set to Peak 1000 which is pretty bright and you might be worried about image retention or Burning uh the reality is not only is MSI offering this but most brands are these days with these
monitors uh they're offering a three-year OLED care warranty that does cover Burnin and image retention so you're covered I mean don't get me wrong it maybe it happened three years in you know you leave your monitor on for like a week straight and suddenly there's image tension but like that to me gives me a lot of peace of mind and it's a big reason why I not only bought a QD OED monitor years ago now but why I bought another one once this set of panels came out if you are still worried about
burning this has got MSI OLED care 2.0 built in which is going to do a bunch of stuff like pixel shift it'll uh Auto taskbars or any static icons even this little short circuit logo or like the little Bottom bar on a YouTube video if you got it up that should all just kind of dim out and not be as uh image retaining you don't want to you don't want to leave static stuff on screen for too long it's bad but like the reality is there burning is not nearly as much of an issue these days one thing you
might want to use those HDMI 2.1 ports for is a PS5 or maybe an Xbox series X because it also supports variable refresh rates if you're not going to you know attach this to a 49 90 and get crazy high refresh rates and then if you are it's got their gaming intelligence app which lets you auto switch between productivity in games it'll change settings for you on the   convenient I've got to say that CS2 with a modern high-end graphics card and then a modern high-end monitor it's just it's
something else oh my God okay well oh explod okay that makes a lot of sense it's like that guy did not shoot me man this looks good I already bought a similar monitor at home I couldn't wait I thought you know I don't care about the curvature I want it now I'm an impatient gamer I don't wait I just buy stuff at full price like an idiot I got to say that the flatness is actually really appealing I didn't think it bothered me as much and you know it's fine I'm going to go home tonight and
I'm not going to cry about it but I really prefer the flat 31 1/2 in 4k like this size for your desk as long as you can have something a little bigger than 27 in it's like it's it's perfect and you really don't need curvature unless it's bigger than this or Ultra wide at a similar size and as for the rest of the panel it just looks incredible like I cannot get over how good 240 HZ running at 4K resolution with QD OLED just incredible colors God it's stunning even everyone behind
me he's like wow that looks so good it's like yeah yeah it does sound like yeah you sound exactly like that Bell that's exactly what you sound like yep that's those 03 millisecond OLED pixel response time that is basically near instant I bought one of these for a reason not this exact model but don't take my word for it let's talk Labs results for color gamut coverage we've got 147% of the srgb color space and they advertised 99% of dcp3 as as well as 78% of bt220 for srgb color accuracy it was pretty good
with a Delta average of just 1.7 in the Pro srgb picture mode HDR is another story we had similar results in both game user and pro user picture modes averaging around a deltae of 23 with luminance error it's oversaturating which honestly most people kind of like anyway whether it's correct or not here's the thing though this 32in 4K 240Hz QD OED display retails at $950 that is absolutely wild and is kind of a steel and that makes this version of this QD OLED panel really freaking
competitive I mean you've got your 90 wats power delivery you've got perfect viewing angles from literally anywhere you are you got 240 HZ like there's just there's some trade-offs for sure for example the only cables we got in the Box were power the usbb and HDMI 2.1 so if you want display port you're going to have to go buy a DP cable if you want the USBC 90 wat power delivery you're going to have to make sure you have a USBC cable that can do 90 wat power delivery and DP alt mode but like you
probably already have those things anyway or at least the DP cable I don't think you need USBC unless you've got like a laptop you want to hook up for being $250 cheaper than the competition honestly I think it kind of wins and I think I regret my purchase yet again it's not the first time I've bought the first shiny new monitor that comes along and then like 3 months later I am kicking myself for not being a more patient gamer and here we are sure there's some other features that I wish
were here and they're not but like it's it's $250 is just a huge price difference it brings this under a grand which is honestly a really big sweet spot when it comes to price or performance for people buying brand new displays that they want to use for like the next 5 plus years thanks so much to MSI for sponsoring today's video If you want to get one of these check it out in the link in the description below
