convinced I was able to convince an industrial company to send me a new very expensive toy I mean tool this thing here is the Ein scan Pro 2x V2 and it's going to allow us to 3D scan things that well we could scan before it was a huge pain in the air this makes it so much easier by the way it doesn't come in this box we put it in this just to make sure that it stays safe when we're moving it between the sets and stuff the first thing we've gotten here isn't the scanner itself but the fastest laptop
that we could find pretty much because the system requirements for this thing are off the charts it's recommended to have a minimum of 32 GB of RAM an i78700 and a 1060 now we have greatly exceeded that this right here has 64 GB of RAM I think a 3080 or something like that anyway this thing is wicked wicked fast because this thing oh uses so so much RAM it actually stores your entire model as a point Cloud as it scans in your system Ram which goes really fast and works really well if you have a
computer such as this one and not so much if your computer is a bit more like this this is made by shining 3D they make a whole bunch of different scanners but we think that the Ein scan Pro 2X is probably the sweet spot you can get cheaper scanners but in our experience those kind of they're just a bit janky they're kind of hard to use it's nowhere near as fast as my personal favorite 3D scanner these guys right here and some 3D modeling that said though it took me about 5 minutes to
learn how to use this thing and it's already just so freaking fast and easy I absolutely love it also in the Box we we get this right here which pairs with this guy right here this is a calibration plate so that we can make sure that every single time that we 3D scan stuff it's going to be real nice and accurate we have a switching power adapter from fsp this guy right here is good for 60 WS delivered over a barrel Jack also a little phone mount so if you want to mount your phone onto this guy
right here you can do that so you don't have to be looking over at your laptop to see how your scan is going in and finally in here we have got some markers these things are for when you have say a really large flat surface like the back of a computer case you can put a bunch of markers on it so that your 3D scan doesn't lose where it's at if you have something that has a whole bunch of features like Buzz Light you're here it can pretty easily see like okay that's there as you're moving along it's
tracking this point and making sure that everything lines up from frame to frame whereas if you you have just a big flat object it can be a lot more difficult for it to figure out where exactly it is which is when you use these markers for power and data on the in Scan they actually have this really interesting way of doing it if you look at the USB cable it's both a USB cable and a power cable so this plugs into your computer right uh there and then we have their Barrel Jack which plugs in right there
and now it's on all right let's do another calibration this is partially just so you guys can see it we did a calibration yesterday but also when you change environments and lighting and stuff like that it's best to just go and rip another calibration and that way you know it's all working just fine and it's really fast too so we're going to just come in right here I'm just pointing the square at the spot in the middle and we are now good I now need to take it and like he's showing on the
screen there attach it to this exactly like that now we just do that again we're going to press the play button up on top and just move away a little bit now we rotate at 90Â° do that again four times now we have three options for scans in here the first is the fixed scan now we do have the turntable on the way which is fantastic for if you want to really accurately 3D scan a small model but at the same time if we have a small model I'm probably just going to Chuck it in
the Luma field and do it that way most people are not cross shopping on scans and Luma Fields but we have both since we're not doing a fix scan we can go and choose between HD scans or rapid scans the main difference that the HD scan is going to be scanning at 10 FPS whereas the rapid is at 30 you do sacrifice some of your detail by doing the rapid scan but that's what we're going to do right now name Buzz Lighty here now I was asking here how we want to do our mode of ignment so that's how it figures out
from frame to frame what those different like 2D is images turn into in 3D As you move around markers we showed off before those are for more like large flat surfaces but buzzl Lightyear has loads of little tiny features so we're just going to use that I think medium resolution is just fine that's 1 mm but if we want to go all the way down to2 of a millimet we can but we're just going to go fast right here we've got our nice scanning platform here here it's a Home Depot bucket covered in dutin can Chuck
Buzz right on the top here and there's only one more thing that we have to do before we can start our scan let tell you about today's sponsor circuit specialists are you looking for electronic components and Equipment circuit specialists provides tools and supplies to the stem community at competitive prices you can explore their wide range of offerings including resistors capacitors soldering stations oscilloscopes and more and by leveraging their technology and sourcing expertise

brightness correctly when it gets too bright everything turns red that means that we're not doing so good we won't be able to capture the detail we turn it down too much and same sort of thing we don't have enough brightness we want to turn it up just until there's a little bit of red in our image and that's where it's going to be perfect now if I'm honest I'm not 100% sure how this works but what I believe is happening is that it's blasting a pattern from the center right here and then it's using the
cameras here and here and the difference stereoscopically between the two is how it does math and figures out how far away something is all right let's start some scanning oh this thing works so well I'm I'm basically just painting in Buzz now going around him checking that the scan's working there one thing that does happen from time to time is if I move away from him the tracking will be lost and the thing that this scanner in particular is really really good at is getting its tracking back in the rice SP
like look right there it's just right back on it and going again I've had a lot of trouble in the past with other scanners where if you just simply go and lose some tracking when you come back on it'll just start adding stuff in the complete wrong spot which is really not fantastic one thing that you guys might be noticing is that it's having some trouble picking up his belt right here that's because it's black 3D scanners really don't like stuff that's super dark or super shiny because it's using
cameras to figure out where the stuff is and if the camera doesn't see anything it does not scan it one thing also if we get too close you'll see that this turns red and if we get too far away it turns blue so it's really nice to have an indicator right here that I am at the correct distance when it is green we just continue going around Buzz here we're almost done and I think that's about as good as we're going to get right now all right now before we head on I just want to get rid of some junk
so we got a little bit of our Home Depot bucket goodbye I'm just shift clicking to select the stuff goodbye you know you don't have to get rid of the stuff right now you can do it later but it's just a little bit easier if you don't even have to worry about postprocessing you can just just delete all of that I accidentally selected some of my actual model so I can control click Circle that bring it back now delete the stuff that I don't want want and I think we're about good
I'm just going to hit generate Point clouds and it should look a lot better now I just need to select between an unwatered and watertight models so that's just the difference between it filling in these areas where I didn't quite get something scanned we're just going to go watertight and see how well it does that is pretty darn good given that we just super quickly did this well I wasn't even really paying attention to the scan I was paying attention to presenting this is a very very usable model look
look at him just just look at Buzzy buzz it looks great now we can just save him here I'm going to do a STL and you can open that up in solid works or Fusion 360 or whatever 3D modeling software you prefer the next thing we want to scan is this PC case now as we talked about earlier stuff that is shiny and stuff that is black can cause problems and as you can see stuff is either shiny or black so we need to do a little bit to get around that first thing we're going to do is place down markers now you want
to put these down not in a pattern they're supposed to be organized such that they sort of just are existing there if you have them in specific patterns it can get confused between like oh is it this pattern of four or that pattern four or that pattern of four don't do that just have them be completely random and it will be much happier now that we've given our case the case of the chicken poox we can go and get rid of those dark and shiny areas using this stuff right here which
is scanning spray if you want you can just use chalk or your feet smell powder or stuff like that but the nice thing about this is that it auto vanishes it just kind of evaporates after a couple of hours how good that is for you I   go cool all right let's see how well this works I did try this yesterday with no markers and with no spray and it just didn't really work which is expected one thing to note is that you want to get as perpendicular as you can you want to be scanning your stuff kind of like this
you don't want to be doing it like that well we're scanning this just some basic speeds and feeds so this thing right here has an accuracy of up to 0.045 mm which is really freaking small it also has a volumetric ACC accuracy of 0.3 mm per meter with markers alignment and it right now it is scanning at 10 FPS although we did do 30 before now one thing that you might have noticed is that we're only capturing 3D data and no textures but that is an option if you want there is a texture upgrade and that
just goes in right here as you can see there's a little USB header so you plug in the camera there it locks in and then you can do full color and get those nice textures on your 3D models right out of the scan although for the most part we're not super concerned about that what we want to be doing is getting computer cases like this one into solid works as quickly as we can so we can do just Bonkers stuff to it we'll finish up the scan of the computer case later it's taking a fair while and I want to get to
some other stuff as you can see here though we looked at it in post and it did a fantastic job good job Justin thanks for doing that speaking of Justin he is the one that really pushed for us to get the Ein scan Pro 2x specifically he has used this in the past as a prop maker to scan a whole bunch of famous people like Nick Cage Rita Jones and I'm going to be joining him in scanning famous people Belle get over here I'm glad my mustache will be captured in 3D if it tells you I'm too
dark it's RAC just look at that it works really really well on people they have so many unique features we can just go right around them here and if you're like a prop maker or someone like that this can be incredibly useful so that you can 3D scan someone in and make sure that you have a nearly perfect model of them in 3D so you can print off like Prosthetics and stuff like that to make them all freaky looking or nice I guess if you want Belle definitely would be in a horror movie though it's actually
super fast at scanning people this is the easiest scan that I've done so far by a lot oh I need to get the top of his head feeling that beak there this feeling weird yet mhm good I think that's about good that looks that looks yeah that's definitely not something you want to be doing if you are one with the epilepsy but look at that Bell that we have right there ah I can't wait for my uh my deep fake you're going to make with that mesh model watertight quality high quality
only the highest of qualities for Bell that is really quite good given how quick and dirty that scan was we have done an excellent job I think there are some spots that I clearly missed like I didn't get right up underneath his cap and I didn't realize that I missed a tiny bit of the top but at the same time like it very clearly got the LT logo on the top we come in here all of this should be really accurate so if we wanted to make something to put on Belle's head or something like that we
very easily could for how quick that was I think this scan is really freaking good we can now 3D print ourselves off a whole bunch of little mini bells and Chuck them around the office it's going to be fantastic we have so much stuff planned for this thing right here I cannot wait to like 3D scan the back of pl's car and just do some really stupid stuff to it if you want to say put a subwoofer in an awkward spot in your trunk you can just scan it with this make sure it fits in nice and perfectly
we're going to be just scanning loads and loads of computer cases with this thing to make sure that we can you know custom mod it in ways that are just really really perfect and I'm just shocked at how easy this thing is to use now it is expensive this thing right here is a around "$5,000 which is not cheap but at the" same time I have in the past used the cheap ones and I have always found that they are just worse than not having a 3D scanner so it's kind of a weird price
jump between you either use your iPhone and a pair of calipers and then you go straight up to this guy right here and oh my God this thing works really freaking well and I cannot wait to just 3D scan everything or CT scan it we we have both now we're going to have some incredible projects for you in the near future just like you viewer are incredible huge thanks for watching hit like get subscribed and I really hope that that garbage truck stops making so much noise it didn't see you later
