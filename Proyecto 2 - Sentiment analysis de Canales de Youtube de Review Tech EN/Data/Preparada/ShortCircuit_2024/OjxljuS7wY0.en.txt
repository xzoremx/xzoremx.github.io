inside this box is my new phone which is great because as you can see I desperately need one the S2 very funny you guys s23 Ultra s look I know they didn't change much this time around but I personally think that a new kind of Glass on the front of a phone yeah that's totally enough to justify a new revision number also that isn't the only thing they changed they've upgraded to the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 processor the base model comes with 12 gigs of RAM instead of just 8 gigs and
Ai No I'm sure there must be something else oh yes the second telephoto lens the zoom one is 5X with a 50 megapixel camera and a faster lens and it's got a titanium frame nice I like titanium titani get a Galaxy titanium that's it huh but there's still a lot for us to experience starting with the display Samsung claims that this new display will reach peak brightnesses of 2600 nits and what's even more unbelievable than that is the fact that we reached even higher results in our independent testing
HDR and we're going to look at this in a second but first can we talk about this gorilla armor I mean normally here on the short circuit set Reflections are a huge problem on devices but both to my eye and even in the camera look at this guys that's a studio light look at that completely washed out on a mere mortal phone is that freaking impressive or what here I'm try to catch that light look at that that's crazy we should just open the video with this not to mention the difference in color performance did
we really open this with ah it's kind of an s23 S because that screen I don't think I've seen anything quite like it on a phone and that anti-glare coating not to mention it's not just anti- glare it almost it almost looks like a matte display but but to touch it it's still glossy I really like this there's a lot to like here here let's do a quick physical tour at the bottom we've got our Sim slot USBC charging port one of our speaker ports and got to love it once you get used to the S Pen man
it's a funny thing because I don't use it every day but when I use it I'm like I'm really glad I have this okay check this out it was dat night the other night and my wife and I have these little cards that tell us okay here's what you're going to do on date night you just scratch it and and that's what you do so our card earlier this week is all go to a dollar store buy glow sticks and tape and turn yourself into glow stick stick people so we were like oh well this is you know really cool and
it'd be great to get a picture of ourselves dressed up like this but we don't want to ask anyone else to take it so I set up my phone on a log grab my S Pen remote shutter let's go oh I guess she asked me not to share this with the internet the point is I like the S Pen on the top microphone I guess we've got an amplified earpiece speaker just right in there and then over on the side we've got our volume rocker as well as our lock button and oh 5G cutout very nice get that millim wave we're looking at a
very similar camera ARR to last time we've got a 200 megap Main shooter a 12 megap Ultra wide instead of the 10 and 10 telephotos we have a 10 and then the 50 megapixel telephoto that I already told you guys about and then at the front we're looking at a 12 megapixel selfie camera as usual with Samsung you can double click to open up your camera app double click again boom I'm taking a selfie oh that looks really sharp damn  good the initial reaction the later reaction wow that that minimum
brightness though honestly as a nighttime phone user in some ways that's more important to me than how bright it can go cuz phones are already bright enough I can use them under basic Landing conditions look at that that is not even close that's awesome I can't even see that and that's a good thing obviously it's a very old phone to be comparing it to GES but that's something that I think our little joke about s23 Ultra s didn't really captures most people are not upgrading their phone from the very last
generation they're upgrading from something older this is so dim I can't find the slider there we go got it fixed and there's a lot to like here I've always kind of liked the curved display I know I know I'm sorry they've gone with a flat display this time doesn't really bother me either way so if that's something you're into then that's great and performance while we found that it wasn't actually as good as some of the other Snapdragon 8 gen 3 devices that we've checked out recently it's
certainly better than the last gen I do have to wonder why this is given how much Samsung has talked about their amazing cooling solution for this film I mean it's certainly not size constraint she's chunky boys though if I had to guess at something I would say maybe they don't want the difference to the exos one to be too much that's that's all conspiracy the I got my tin foil hat on for that one I mean I've got the hair do for it I'm not saying it's aliens but aliens one thing that's not
different from one region to the next is the titanium frame I um I don't know like cool I guess right like that's neat I think most people are probably going to put a case on it speaking of cases our sponsor dbrand their grip line of cases is now available for the s24 series they are well I mean it's self-explanatory they're grippy they feel great in the hands the buttons are super clicky which I still do not fully understand how they've done using a like rubberized case to add extra click to
the button I don't know it doesn't matter the point is it supports mag safe and it's available now at Short lin.com not only did they buy the domain they keep renewing it coming back to Performance in games the s24 ultra was also behind other Snapdragon 8 gen 3 devices particularly when it comes to frame time consistency so the 1% lows that we observed in Dolphin as well as genin impact were a little bit on the lower side which is to say you're still going to be getting a
pretty darn good gaming experience play wi games on this thing incredible another area where it falls behind other similarly equipped phones though is battery longevity to be clear we are not disputing Samsung's claims of all day battery life in fact we found that we got over 24 hours of YouTube playback at 480p 200 nits brightness that's great it just isn't the 30 hours that Samsung claims our stress test saw us land just shy of 3 hours which is pretty darn solid and our charge time was very
reasonable an hour at 65 WTS though should be noted that um that was not with an included charger does it have Wi-Fi 7 yes hey that's not in the list Wi-Fi 7 is freaking awesome and if you don't already love it you should what about Bluetooth 5.4 no 5.3 5.4 is some big improvements in terms of latency as long as you have a compatible device anyway okay still y57 very cool the display is 6.8 in it's 12 20 HZ so obviously it feels super smooth and we've managed to get this far into this
video without talking about any of the Glorious AI now I haven't personally experienced any of this stuff so the one and only Jake bellance our producer on short circuit is going to tell me two that are the best that I should experience right now does all kinds of cool stuff their Notes app now locally will handle transcribing your conversations and meetings apparently it can even handle multiple people there's interpreter functions Android auto it'll summarize incoming messages and suggest
relevant replies that's super cool ooh Galaxy AI editing tools okay so in your photos some of these things run locally so if you want to remove a shadow or reflection or something like that that'll actually run on the beefed up AI processor that's built right into the phone but then some of these things do rely on the cloud like if you want to move a person around or remove an object okay bellance what are we doing Circle to search with Google Circle to search with Google all right okay okay okay
okay okay so I'm going to take a picture and I have no idea how this stuff works I wasn't at impact so I'm going to take a picture of myself I'm taking a picture of myself picture I'm going to take a picture of myself then I'm going to then I'm going to hold the home button which one's the home oh my God Bix where's the home where the hell's the home button how do I find the home button I don't have on screen buttons it's broken I  it got your S Pen yeah I've got it just chill you just hold on the bar what
that's stupid okay hold home button okay I'm going to search this guy yeah I'm try I'm trying to try it  way I did not stage that I did not stage that uh okay we can search for anything so I don't know I could just do this like  cool why are all the results from Reddit so far are they just appending Reddit to every search okay what's this thing okay what is that I swear to God if this is Reddit again no way no way no way actual link to buy okay this feature exclusive to the s24 series right now
actually I think it's all coming to the s23 too all the AI stuff but there is no way this doesn't come to basically anything that'll do it because Google desperately wants all this delicious data they want it anytime you're going to buy Google's like I'm there oh who wait wait wait oh man I could play with this feature all day I think okay can't find it oh no way I'll D store.com baby it's so fast cuz it runs locally thank God we're all over this whole Cloud thing you know why it happened
because Google and Microsoft and all these guys are looking at their Data Center cost going like holy how is this sustainable what what is it that thing we used to do where we put like processing power in the user's actual device let's do that love it swiping up is going to give us some quick fixes we could add some background blur you know what that's actually not  pretty cool especially for only having you know one camera not bad though not bad especially if it's doing this processing
on device object eraser this is all this is stupid let's get rid of it that's very usable yeah that's you know what I'm I'm kind of into it that is definitely an improvement let's get a picture of me with shadows on my face then makes my nose look even bigger which is impressive oh here we go here we go here we go okay well well oh no  um oh boy okay not what I intended uh I I I don't want to get rid of any of the dynamism in my lighting I just I just want to remove this like weird Shadow on
my face and instead we just get like this weird nonsense  uh now that that is some nightmare fuel it has like an assist which is kind of cool to help you stay on the lines at least it feels like it I that wow buddy that's pretty good okay give me one more AI editing tools AI editing tools all right let's take a picture okay so how do we do this uh oh this maybe advanced intelligence oo really okay reimagine your images move remove and resize the people and objects and use advanced intelligence to fill in
the background okay so that was like the crappy local version we were using before this is super cool I want this computer to move yeah okay I'm going to put it there so what this is free until 2025 and then realistically after that you get to pay dang that's actually not bad how did it fill this in did it just guess or is it using imagery of the Northern Lights desk pad like did it go find out what this thing is and what's supposed to be there that's pretty impressive save his
copy a visible Watermark will be overlaid on the output image in order to indicate that it is AI generated so this is interesting especially in light of the recent controversy with AI generated images of Taylor Swift Samsung is marking both in the metadata and actually on the image itself that the image has been yeah there it is AI doctored there it is right there that would be so hard to crop out and then repost with no metadata somewhere this solves the  hilarious solution
solved subscribe to Short Circuit oh wait we didn't talk pricing the s24 series is priced anywhere from 40 at the 1 TB capacity to $100 more than the s23 series and while the s23 series was priced really high this uplift doesn't seem that unreasonable given that at that base tier where it's 100 Adder at least you're getting additional RAM how do you feel about that Apple should should anyone put any RAM on their devices or will it make you look bad at any rate that's it for today subscribe
to Short Circuit see you later guys
