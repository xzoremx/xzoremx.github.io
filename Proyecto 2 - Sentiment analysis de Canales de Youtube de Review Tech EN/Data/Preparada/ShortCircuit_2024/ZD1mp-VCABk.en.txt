what up it's your boy Riley back to take another look at kind of a weird product cuz that's my Mo apparently on this channel next we go sponsor this video so we can take a look at the gripon which is both a Nintendo switch controller and a dock for like five bucks more than the standard price of a Nintendo switch dock which I mean I'm not good at math but if I was if I was doing some then it would feel good right there this thing has apparently got hall effect joysticks it has customizable
button macros in some form and so there's lots to take a look at before we get too deep into the features let's just take a look at the actual Hardware it comes with this little box here with extra joystick covers on it oh they look like they're bigger maybe nice we got documentation well actually before we look at the documentation look at that oo oo I always like a good good like uh fabcy FY looking feeling thing on Tech it's too often that Tech just like is not homey I want to feel like I can go
to sleep on it and that's not the case with this but there's a chance most of this stuff is just talking about like oh these are the Nintendo switch buttons on the like standard Nintendo switch controllers but oo I like those colors but we also have some extra buttons uh especially on the back look at those okay let's do a little overview quick starts guide safety guidelines be safe when gaming it's important listen to your mom in this scenario that's me I'm your mom obviously on this side you know
joystick minus button d-pad settings button and a capture button on this side we got the plus button uh letter buttons other joystick home button and T which is the turbo button which will allow you to you know specify any one of these buttons that you want the controller to mash for you in button mashing situations which in switch games we know we know they're there okay when we look at the rest of the controller though things uh diverge a little bit obviously we got the trigger buttons and shoulder
buttons here but we also have the USBC charging port the HDMI output uh for when you're in docked mode it's a switch so it's going to Output at 1080p not anything super super fancy for now Nintendo and a usba a port uh for you know when you're in docked mode if you want to attach extra wired controllers I'm assuming over here we got two spaces for game card storage uh so the switch itself is going to have the cartridge slot and then you can have two extras you know if you want them poping lock
poping low if someone challenges you to a duel in the street you got to be ready now over here are those back buttons I was talking about out and these unlike the turbo button which will just Mash stuff on the back these buttons will you can you can set macros so uh if you hold it and press some buttons we'll we'll figure we'll show you later down here is the button to switch between docked and handheld mode when you have an HDMI connected and down here a kickstand so it's like it's not just
that it's like a dock you know a fake dock it's like it's it'll stand up it'll fancy it'll have some class and then of course there's the uh USBC port at the bottom there which is what we're going to slide the switch into right now okay big moment okay this is it feels wrong at a certain level but it also feels like right like this feel look at this this could be a product that came together Nintendo it's going to be fine it's going to be okay it's going to be fine it's going to be I know it's a
third party controller ooh o that felt good that was a joke but it did feel really nice it clicks in dang I mean it's like it's the same click as the uh as the joycons actually now I'm curious about how to do I just does it just pop out without you don't have to press a release button you can just slide it out that is very satisfying it's just working I mean no setup necessary apparently to get the basic features working here but what you're supposed to do is go to settings controllers and
sensors Pro Controller wired communication it's already on we're in Pro mode already on this channel normal mode only normal mode even though I've got the nexico grip Con on my side I like how uh meaty the uh the buttons feel like obviously compared to the original switch uh controller buttons they're very clicky you know it's like a small little thing you know for for a handheld console they did pretty good but this button is like it's got some weight to it there's longer travel
distance and there appears to be a pretty solid tactile bump still like there's a I've used some Xbox controllers that feel kind of mushy like it's a big button it's got some travel it feels like you're pressing something significant but it doesn't really have that kind of bump to it this has a very satisfying bump and I think all of the buttons do more or less h i can immediately tell that this is a hall effect joystick what you huh what's that I love this game so the vibration is I think pretty
strong I actually like it but thankfully nexeco has a feature where you can adjust the intensity of the vibration so uh and that's through the controller not through Nintendo's software so that's pretty cool it's so weird in games like this that you the jump and shoot are different buttons right like but like I want to jump and shoot you have to you have to do this maybe I've just you know I I grew up as a console gamer and I've been PC gaming for so long now that the idea of
only using this thankfully nexigo has thought about people like me who are frustrated by that so that we have the we have the macro buttons we're going to map them I'm going to map jump to this one and maybe on this one I'll map like four different buttons we'll see we got to hit the setting button for 2 seconds until an LED shows up okay all right now that led is shining bright and I'm going to press the button you want to map for me that's that and then I press the back button and now it's solid white the
solid white means that it's set successfully every time you press this key an angel gets its wings okay so I mapped jump and now I can jump and shoot like look at this no one can stop me if I'm at the same time so from now on if I'm jumping it's cuz I'm pressing this bad boy I'm not pressing B I'm not even going to touch B ever again even when I go home okay I'm going to map the other button to this like aim and fire combo for the secondary weapon all right so let's enter mapping mode again with the
setting button it's blinking I have to have the timing right I have to hold the button until it's charged and then fire boom boom okay so now I'm going to map that to this one so when I press that right button it does it w oh I'm probably the best Samus ever now I'm going to go beat the boss like okay yes normally I wouldn't be prepared but I got hall effect joysticks we're going to map a turbo button before I go into the boss just so I'm prepared but apparently I didn't know this you could
set the you can set the turbo button to automate button mashing on one of these buttons but you can also adjust the speed you can either activate it 12 times per second which is the default or 20 times per second okay I'm going to it's going to be fire so hold this and then press this hopefully that worked we'll see oh here we go okay okay ah boom boom boom oh I'm scared I'm scared I don't know how to play this game oh gosh yeah no this is a bad idea oh use the turbo button turbo oh it didn't work
um got him okay so we figured it out if you hold the button and press turbo you're going to enter semi-auto mode so by holding the down the button it's not it's as if I'm not holding it down I'm just pressing it over and over and over again and I can start and stop that if I hold the button and press turbo again it'll enter the second mode which is full auto that's just firing all the time you're firing you're a firing your laser and you don't want to do anything else which in this case is what I want
to do so I'm going up to see the boss one more time let's go oh here we go oh he's he's done he's done he's done man you're over it's over fire oh jump jump jump jump jump jump and I think that means I won thanks nexigo he helped a a little old Noob like me get to the Championships now the last thing I just wanted to to show here was that this thing has gyro control like a regular um you know Nintendo controller so um there's that as well I mean that probably looks horrible for you the
viewer and um you know I would never recommend using this form of uh stere oh see what hold on a second what how does this this is why you should never use it I wouldn't use it but the point is that it's there so if you ever need to give  her the gyro control is there like in a regular Nintendo controller hey one day older Riley here uh back on set because we real realized we didn't actually test out the dock functionality so we're going to do that right now okay so just like a regular dock you have to plug
into Power uh and then your HDMI going to your TV and and we're there so I mean it's a it's a dock and like I said you can press that button on the back to switch between the TV and the console pretty quick switching from the TV to the console and it takes a bit more time Swit switching from the console back to the TV but that's because it has to work harder to push the the frames uphill that's one issue if you got a thick HDMI cable then you might have some issues uh having
it want to stay there we go a perfect nexico thought of that so yeah if you want the traditional dock experience you can set it down there and use another controller or you know you can still use this controller uh as well if you want to play with other people and project to a to a TV so and this is what playing switch looks like just you know cool there's the dock functionality bam well overall I'm pretty happy with the experience I had with this thing it's 65 bucks uh again $5 more than the
Nintendo doc but you get like a whole controller with it with extra features it comes in a couple of colors actually I forgot to say there's this purple one and this blue one and they all have this sort of like you know that that kind of I don't know if you probably can't legally call it Atomic purple or whatever but it's you know it's that it's that see-through uh design that has come back into style and thank goodness um so if you have other aesthetic sensibilities than just uh minimalist
black option then those are there for you I didn't even put the uh the little extra things on and hey you know what they kind of look like tires look at that so if you want to play Mario Kart with those it might make it better if any of this pequs your interest uh there's a link in the description you can go check out the nexigo gripon and if anything else piques your interest when it comes to unboxing products well you're on the right channel we got lots of other videos for you we're going to
