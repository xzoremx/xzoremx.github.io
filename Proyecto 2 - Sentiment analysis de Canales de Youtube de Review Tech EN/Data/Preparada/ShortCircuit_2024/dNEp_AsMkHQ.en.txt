phone okay it's not a phone in fact it can't even take a SIM card but hear me out because the Ino pocket DMG portable handheld gaming system I think has more in common with a phone than it does with pretty much anything else for starters it uses a Snapdragon processor specifically the g3x Gen 2 which is pretty similar to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 it also has an OLED touchscreen on the front a fingerprint scanner and it runs flipping Android so functionally speaking it's an Android phone with no
sim slot and a controller attached to it which doesn't mean that it's a bad thing there's a ton of great emulators on Android if you want to play retro games it just means that unlike some handhelds we've seen recently that use fpgas to Faithfully recreate the hardware of the original console this is relying on software emulation however that does mean that it comes with a little bit more versatility let's take a look shall we I'm just going to put this one aside for now but we will be taking a look at
it later First Impressions very interesting obviously it is heavily inspired by the original Nintendo Game Boy but in addition to your d-pad your ab and your start and select buttons there's a joystick what appears to be a clicky touchpad and then a whole whack of buttons on the left and on the right side of the device we'll take a look at those more closely in a bit first let's check out the accessories okay A little bit of documentation USB ctoc charging cable but no brick that will have to be purchased
separately though they did include a little retro themed one in our gift box along with some joystick caps and what appears to be an affordably manufactured metal mug what else is in here oh tempered film screen protector whatever tempered film means and a little carrying case ooh also included wait is that a replacement joystick top a joystick cap matching the body color is included in the packaging which Gamers can freely replace to show their personality those those really
look a lot like the same color to me but maybe I'm missing something here anyway  these a couple of cute metallic replacement shoulder buttons cool enough about accessories though let's fire this thing up oh and while we wait for it to boot up now's is good time is I need to take a look at the IOP pocket micro this has a downgraded processor from mediatech a smaller screen but with a more modern 3x2 aspect ratio and apparently still enough power to play PS2 games with the appropriate buttons
this form factor also I got to say appeals to me a little bit more even though she's a little on the thick side for a controller I assume this is the power button with the fingerprint sensor and I assume this is a screen protector ah ah yes let's talk about some things that they both have in common power buttons with built-in fingerprint sensors micro SD slots for expandable storage particularly important if you have a large collection of retro games large active cooling
solutions with the pocket DMG apparently being able to do up to 15 watts on the processor and they both have hall effect joysticks oh in this case two there are some differences in the specs that just come down to the processors being used so the micro is limited to Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.2 while the DMG can do up to Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3 this I don't know if it's s so related but this one is USB 3 10 GB per second and this one's only USB 2 none of those things are going to make a huge difference to me
playing retro games what's going to make a big difference to me is the form factor and the screens the DMG has a much higher resolution display it uses a 1240 x 1080 OLED display that they claim Peaks at 450 nits which should make for a really vibrant gaming experience but a really unusual almost 8x7 aspect ratio that's going to put black bars on just about anything you play even Game Boy games are not quite at this aspect ratio meanwhile the micro uses exactly four times the screen resolution of the Game
Boy advanced it doesn't get quite as bright and it's IPS instead of OLED so you're not going to get that same outstanding contrast but the 3x2 aspect ratio means that if you're playing more modern titles you are uh less likely to have ginormous black bars ah yes they both have some pretty interesting buttons on them so what does RC do remote control perhaps where did that go okay I had the settings open and RC brought me back to home okay hold on does it do the same thing here
RC no okay apparently on this one we figured out RC is kind of like a home button and then LC is your your multitask button and some things in Android are going to operate with the d-pad and some things just kind of won't yeah that that that sort of checks out and then on this one I don't know I guess we swipe up for home and RC I assume is a programmable button but it's not immediately obvious to me where it is and honestly I don't really care I'm mostly focused on the gaming experience
right now are these but oh waa there's lots of buttons here oh you know what that's actually kind of a clever place for them I don't think I would accidentally press those so we got my start and select and then there you go okay got your little IOP space uh slide in interface and whatever this guy does which seems to be nothing okay all right you know what I'm going to try the pocket DMG first is this actually a dedicated volume wheel wow and a button wow and it mutes it wow
push and hold you can do all kinds of stuff whoa you can change the brightness and your performance change your vibration your fan speed and previous Shader oh you can change shaders oh that's so cool oh they call it a magic switch you know what I like it is this one giant button or is this oh no that's your R2 and your L2 oh interesting okay let's play a game enough of this but first a message from our sponsor Swan take your security further with their Max Ranger camera system you'll
get Crystal Clear 4K video and Wi-Fi Halo technology allows you to connect each camera wirelessly to the NVR hub "from up to 2,000 ft away in open air or" up to 650 ft away through almost any obstacle that's up to six whole football fields of wirefree coverage with built-in solar panels that keep the cameras charged all year round Plus there's no monthly subscription fees and it even comes with a pre-installed 64 gig SD card check it out at our Link in the description and use code circuit 25 
off okay control type here we go I've got touchscreen or touchcreen cool uh gyro aiming is supported by the way both of these do have Gyros theoretically this is an xinput controller so it should just work but I guess it doesn't why don't I play something else wow this runs a lot better than the Game Gear one I'll tell you that much oh sorry Simba sorry I see what you mean about the d-pad being a little bit on the bigger side that is interesting I didn't I would never have thought about
it until I actually played a game but it's a little slow to roll on it you know like when you're going one way and then you oh actually I want to go the other way I want to fine-tune this or whatever you know you know what as bad as this aspect ratio would be for modern things it's not bad here there's just a little bit of letter boxing I'm I'm okay with that yeah let's try a Game Boy game okay let's go Game Boy Color uh razor yeah Razor scooter wow so you actually end up with a tiny pillar box did they
tell me what to do oh dude oh look at that grind let's go boom boom woo grind let's go woo grind set dang it so you're not going to get that like Pixel Perfect Fidelity that you might get on another device but the resolution is high enough that honestly it just doesn't seem like a problem to me okay what do you want to try you want to try dolphin Super Smash Bros melee okay so we're going to need uh we're going to need an analog stick here I think this is really not a great spot for an analog
stick but boy does the GameCube ever look good on this thing like dang you know like like dang Zelda is going to absolutely obliterate me I have never even played the GameCube version of this game I have only played the switch one and I'm dead nice performance seems fine I haven't noticed any obvious hitching yeah no obvious issues I mean I wouldn't have expected any it's a pretty powerful little s so that's neat there's one more button we haven't talked about yet a power mode switch whoa game mode Let's
go whoa Max mode ho holy shnikies listen to that fan go let's try Call of Duty apparently Bell map some controls for me already so I won't have to use a touch screen up here okay here we go here we go so you want me to use the touchpad okay oh o okay oh oh boy oh boy oh boy okay I shot him in the knee then you can bind the buttons to whatever you want I guess but oh my goodness goodness okay let's try the other one realistically it's more of a portable emulation machine less of a I would
actually play Modern mobile touchcreen games on this so all right let's try the micro honestly even though it's less powerful this is the one I'm a little bit more interested in personally anyway oh what dude let's go man these joysticks are right up in my face when I'm trying to play video games games I was a little confused I was like wow there's some really good upscaling I forgot that they remastered the game for the allstars releas like dang I don't remember the nest looking this good they made a point
of saying that it's a single piece of glass across the front so it's like kind of a seamless deal so that's pretty cool if it was an OLED display it'd be a lot cleaner looking because you wouldn't be able to see the kind of glowing not quite black bars you can kind of see that right I definitely prefer the form factor this one though that is uh a big difference man I hit the A and X like every time I touch these it is really small like it wouldn't be a problem for  adult you're going to notice it oh I
want to hear the speakers not bad wow they get kind of Amplified by your hands like naturally just from holding it I like the farm Factor better this one she's a little heavy though aluminum casing versus pretty darn sure this is a  DMG oh no dang it defeated by a Legge and you might be defeated by the pricing of these because as cool as these devices are they are how you say not cheap the pocket DMG starts it's at $450 and goes as high as 700 I'll be it that's for a 16 gigs of RAM 1 tbte of
storage version so it's not exactly a low-spec device but you've got to be the kind of person who knows you want a powerful Android device in this form factor and you have a lot of games you want to play on it otherwise it's going to be pretty tough to justify as for the micro it starts at $220 and if you want 256 gigs of storage it goes up to $249 that is quite a bit more compelling to me but it is a little bit on the cramped side so your mileage may vary if you guys enjoyed this video subscribe to
