I can't think of anyone else I know who's gone from caring so much about wearables to caring so little about them but the OnePlus watch 2R is an interesting one for me for starters it's pretty affordable on launch promo it's $200 which is still a lot of money but when you look at the feature set available here starting of course with the extremely impressive battery life claims there's a lot to care about first of all it is noticeably lighter in the hand compared to the previous OnePlus
Watch 2 now this does come with a downgrade in terms of materials it no longer has 2 and 1 12d sapphire glass and it uses an aluminum chassis rather than a stainless steel one but for the difference in price and the difference in weight honestly I'd be kind of tempted to take it it's got a fairly strong if not comprehensive sensor Suite with an acceleration sensor gyroscope Optical heart rate sensor Optical pulse oximeter sensor geomagnetic sensor light sensor and ometric sensor but the really
impressive one that jumps off the page to me is the dual GPS antennas this allows it to use both L1 and L5 GPS frequencies simultaneously allowing claimed accuracy of just 30 cm and okay that doesn't matter for what some people are going to do with a watch which is check the time presumably but if you're a runner for example and you like to track your running routes or your cycling routes or whatever the case may be having accurate distance tracking is incredibly important and using multiple
frequencies doesn't just mean improved accuracy it can mean improved consistency of performance as well it's already more comfortable than the OnePlus Watch 2 that thing was a chunk and this one is still pretty on the chunky side it's only available in one size large but at least being lighter I don't feel it dragging my wrist to nearly the same degree I haven't mentioned yet what drew me to the OnePlus Watch 2 in the first place and that was that they have I think it's over a 100 different activity
trackers including my personal favorite physical activity badminton so they count all the usual stuff like your heart rate but also count your strokes and your longest Rally from my experience it actually worked reasonably well especially considering that I wear my watch on my offand so it doesn't have the benefit of knowing when I'm swinging my arm really hard but I lost it which is actually why I stopped using it I traveled and I I left it somewhere that was my bad I have a little bit of
feedback still left over from the OnePlus Watch 2 the charger doesn't stay magnetically attached that well so let's see if they've improved that with the 2R yeah that could be better straight off the face it's not too bad it grabs pretty good but where I really ran into trouble was you got your wall wart right which unfortunately is not provided then you got your cable and if there's any see that torsional strain on it it it comes off pretty easily so you just got to watch out for that it supports 7 and
1/2 watt fast charging though which is kind of wild because it means along with some of their more efficiency-minded modes you can charge up for a day's worth of use and they claim about 10 minutes now I was having a conversation with someone recently who charges their watch at their desk at work and I was like why would you do that just charge it on your night stand at night and they were like well I like to use it for sleep tracking so for people like that having the ability to rapidly charge
during the day could be incredibly useful is o health the same as OnePlus Health nope that makes sense good job OnePlus blah blah blah blah blah Good Luck me hey there we go we're setting up oh this is controversial the interface for the watch has two buttons neither of which are a turnable crown in any way whatsoever so if you want to scroll you got to do it like this personally I don't think that's that big of a deal I never really used a crown for scrolling in the past anyway even
when I had an Apple Watch but your mileage may vary one of the buttons is for accessing weos apps the other is a dedicated Fitness tracking button which apparently includes swimming I've been doing a lot of swimming lately yeah it's been it's been really good I'm really tired and sore every day why does the industry have to copy everything Apple does you know how Apple has that really cool like QR code that's a floating Point Cloud so they have one but it doesn't do anything
it serves no purpose to the pairing process it's just all Bluetooth pairing with like a number code people get after me when I rant about Apple and like you know them doing something dumb or anti-consumer and they're like why are you always going after Apple so hard it's because everything Apple does gets cloned by the entire rest of the industry and in a way it's kind of a compliment Apple's such a leader in the space that if I don't go hard at them I'm implicitly saying it's
okay for everyone else to do it and there's a tour coming through here so I guess I'll tell you about our sponsor vessie their new Courtside classic brings a vintage tennis look to everything that you already knew and loved about vess's shoes like their lightweight designs and water ready materials the best summer days are often unpredictable so your feet need to be ready for any occasion whether that's a surprise Lake day chilling on a boat or one of those long nights in the city so
don't wait snag a pair today and if you use our Link in the video description you will automatically get 15% off your entire order got some tech tips the NFC antenna is up here apparently it's good to know and we're all set up that was actually a pretty painless setup process all right swipes yep hasn't changed yep control center hey there you go oh y as far as tutorials go that wasn't too bad display looks really nice I mean obviously nothing compares to an actual mechanical time piece oh always on
display is not on by default but it is supported in fact now is a perfect opportunity to talk through some of oneplus's claims with respect to battery life they are saying you can get a 100 flipping hours out of this thing and they actually came with receipts I can't say that I agree all of these numbers are typical I could absolutely see a use case where you talk through your watch a lot more than just 5 minutes a day but I do think it's really cool that if they're going to make these claims they
do provide a breakdown of what that usage looks like a more realistic number is probably the 48 hours that they claim for heav use now that's not the only way it can operate in its power saving mode they claim that it can go up to 12 days and one of the things that enables this is that it has two processors a super low power one and a Snapdragon W5 that it wakes up to run we OSS apps o workouts okay so let's have a look at what they got here fat burn what the hell is a fat burn Run Okay so it just
guides you on you know where to keep your heart rate okay that's pretty cool hey there it is like I said actually worked reasonably well as far as I could tell anyway top swing speed longest rally I don't know how it would measure your the kilometers of your swing speed there's certain things that I just I'd rather have no data than something that you're making up but things like how many swings you took um weree something that seemed pretty accurate oh they have a couple of
different uh colorways for the watch green and gray apparently uh yeah the green one seems nice but gray is also great I guess tap to wake is off oh so always on display does not mean awake well wait how do I wake it oh no I have to wake it with the button okay I'm going to turn that back on tap to wake rais to wake yeah you you be awake I'm trying to interact with you let's place a phone call is this going to be volume for me no oh oh yep one moment please I okay so I've got you on the line but I'm
in the phone app but I can't even I can't even see that I'm talking to you here we go okay I found it volume hey there we go oh wow that's as loud as it gets hey hey man I can scream in the phone if you want me to no no no no it's not you it's not you it's h my wrist is vibrating when you talk where the devil is the speaker on this thing you know what usable but if you're in a crowded or loud environment not that usable but realistically if you have a smartwatch I assume you have some you know earphones
as well it seems like the most tertiary of the three mobile devices what I'm  latency not bad very usable my stress is 43 good you know what I'm going to try it a lot of the features are more geared towards Runners like it can measure your stride length and stuff like that apparently and I'm more swimming and badminton these days but realistically the fitness tracking aspects of a watch are not the ones that appeal the most to me anyway I want to see how it handles uh messages not notifications voice to
text that sort of thing so maybe you'll see an update with longer term use on the wano it's got 32 gigs of onboard storage 2 gigs of RAM 500 mah battery oh and it's ip68 so I can definitely use it for swimming without busting it hopefully I you never know when it comes to saltwater chlorination and all that subscribe to Short Circuit
