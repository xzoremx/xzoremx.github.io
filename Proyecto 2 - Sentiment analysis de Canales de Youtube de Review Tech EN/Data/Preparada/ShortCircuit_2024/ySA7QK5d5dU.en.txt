you know when they told me this chair was revolutionary I really thought it would spin better than that Jokes Aside though guys I am so sore from the weekend I need this chair more than anything right now they claim it's the perfect lounge chair which sounds like heaven right now the problem with Heaven is that before you can get there you have to go through life and my life right now is building this chair which looks like it involves a lot of steps inside this box that I'm
painstakingly unpacking is the baitman lab's Envy armchair they say it is crafted by Master Woodworkers with cushions that were designed by Gamers and programmers for all day comfort and wrapped in Fabrics that will look great in any room really with our teal wall that's going to be a challenge especially for this shade of green but we'll see how it goes but there's more they also sent over an ottoman and side table and an R desk that apparently turns this chip into a full-blown battle
station that will make you not want a desk anymore I really hope I une some instructions at some point this is  ooh that is one swanking headrest good God that's a headrest what am I a two-headed ogre oo still not sure where the whole it replaces my desk thing comes in but maybe that'll be more apparent once once I figure out this pile I think I figured out what this cushion is for I think this is the butt cushion they weren't kidding about crafted for programmers even my generous
Caboose takes up like 2/3 of this feel like a kid sitting in my Dad's chair how is this a computer chair this is it's literally an armchair Belle this is "$2,500 I really want to win it at the" Christmas party "$2,725 I don't know if that includes the" ottoman to be clear I'm not saying it's overpriced this kind of material this kind of expert craftsmanship it costs money I'm just saying that it's a lot of it just so I know how much of our short circuit product selection is dictated by
what you'd like to win at the Christmas party not that much those AI glasses though that was a real I want that choice how can one chair be in so very many pieces that's a strapping young  self-explanatory oh that's cool they pre-assemble it once to make sure that it works you can see marks on it from where they assembled it that's important in woodworking love to see that this is  comfortable I'm also almost out of screws I only got two screws left stubby screwdriver LTT store.com this is a
perfect use case for it they put the year on here made in Canada like me put the more firm cushion on the seat and the softer cushion on the bat there's like six cushions boom just like that o craftsmanship but I'm kind of afraid to sit down while I have this many pieces hanging over me also while I haven't told you about our sponsor thanks to Corsair for sponsoring this video if you spend just as much time looking at your beautiful rig as you do using it corsair's 3500x midtower case might be

description where's the pocket what does the the instructions say there's a there's a pocket for the Allen wrench in case you ever want to make adjustments oh sick here in my wood pocket boom okay no no hold on I'm going to build the other thing I'm not going to settle into it yet I want to know what the heck's going on with all this other stuff oh I got the headrest actually I got two different versions of the headrest normal Deluxe I'm going with the normal one boom Oh and you don't even have to
put it there if you don't want to boom head rest over there there there doesn't seem to be anything in the instructions about the headrest but we're going to go with that it's this I feel solid considering it's just like just like a press fit in there Envy armchair done and I only have two extra screws oh wait no I found it I found it I found this it's this guy oh no oh no no I can't put it in now you skipped a step no here comes the Ottoman  I may have allowed my expectations to
spiral out of control you do need a nice firm foam here so it doesn't feel like you're just sitting on the wood that's underneath you um and they really nailed that as long as you like sitting in exactly this posture than like they nailed it but there's not really any adjustments right um this is cool though we haven't really talked about the modular interface at all so check this out see these holes here along the sides of the the armrests the back and actually also here on the ottoman
they're for accessories so I've actually got one of them here this is a desk accessory and I got to say this is one of the cleverer implementations of this concept that I have seen look at that solid need to get up you can actually get out of the chair without like extracting yourself from it yeah this is pretty cool and they've got all kinds of little accessories that can go into the interface as well like cup holder accessory ahh what else we got in here I don't even know what half of this stuff is
this looks like a headphone hanger though ah the sky is pretty much the limit here's a riser that allows you to mount the accessories up higher if you happen to be taller laptop holder and if you reach out to them they will give you the design drawings so that you can 3D print your own accessories for it pretty darn cool oh that's the controller caddy oh all right yeah that makes way more sense okay what's this one microphone mount oh buddy so it goes right there oh like you
just put it on there like that to your arm wait it would work the other way it would work equally well the other way Belle boom armrest yeah I might have too many accessories mounted to it I don't need armrest anyway screw it I'm real man which is why I don't settle for laptops I want a desktop and that is where this accessory comes in uh how does this work oh no way boom don't mind me just getting some work done cuz I got to go to work work work work work work work wow do we have
a lot of height adjust on that bad boy oh yeah oh yeah bud okay let's get this let's get this puppy in here things are getting a little more extracte when it's time for me to go get my cable I  to nice dude I'm going to get so much work done now hey look at that it's Riley week on Flo plane we ask Riley your burning questions what is that for we still haven't figured that out all right so it's a side table for putting your Tower PC in and there's more accessory ports and it's a side table so
I could put my knife and my screwdriver having been sitting in here since I sat down down I'm not experiencing any fatigue I'm not experiencing any pressure points I would say that it is a quality chair as for whether this is the kind of setup that you'd like to have for the price well you can only answer that if you go to the baitman lab's website and have a look at the pricing I'll let you guys be the judge what I won't let you be the judge of is whether you should subscribe to Short
Circuit the answer is yes do it
