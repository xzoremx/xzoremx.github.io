14in gaming laptops have just exploded in popularity but even though they're so small they are a big impact on your wallet except for ah this one right here it's a medium big impact on your wallet here we have the Predator Helios neo4 it's like the Helios 14 but the Neo means it's a little bit cheaper which honestly matters quite a bit in this segment right now first thing that I'm noticing fingerprints they really show up for power we have a 230 W brick which is delivered over a
real old school looking Barrel Jack now I do wish that they had something that's a little bit more modern but at the same time for that kind of power you aren't going to be able to deliver it efficiently over USB type c so they can't just be using that so I guess Barrel Jack's fine do we have stickers here we go we've got to do it it's the rules laptop comes with stickers they go on the laptop do you like that real bow no training no enter heck yeah there we go that's 5 FPS right
there for sure this laptop's clearly been uh through the review cycle a bit we are not the first ones with it and you can tell because it's kind of mangled back here look at how wavy that is for a 14-in gaming laptop we do have quite a solid assortment of IO so on the right hand side we have a micro SD card slot USB type-c with display out and charging usba a and a full-size HDMI port 2.1 and around on the left we have the input for our Barrel Jack another USB type a thunderbolt 4 and a headphone
microphone combo Jack now around the back and most of the sides we have a whole lot of heat sink we can see there all the way to there on the side that's all heat sink that's all heat sink this thing better perform really freaking good cuz that's a lot of heat sink and I'd be pretty embarrassed if it doesn't it's not light it's not super heavy it is 4.29 lb which is pretty good for something of this power it does have a 4070 in it and for the rest of the world that is 1.95
kgs how heavy is this charger though it's much larger than like the Gallum nitride ones that we see in some other guys ooh 6 lb carry weight that's getting up there for sure once you add this overall besides the e of fingerprinting this machine I do think the build quality is quite High it appears to be manufactured out of stamped aluminum and the chassis rigidity is pretty good it's kind of soft over here actually I'll take it off the map for you not that this area of the keyboard
really matters but it's something to note now before I turn it on it does seem like it can be passable enough for professional environments it isn't too wild with the gamer design but let's see what happens once the RGB gets enabled oh that's a lot I guess you can turn that off but uh you going to want to make sure that you turn it off before you go to your lawyer or whatever sure the RGB here looks pretty funky and that is largely because it's only three zones so we have color color color instead of
each individual key being its own RGB light which doesn't allow you as much customization but at the same time it's one of the things makes the Helios Neo just a little bit cheaper than the other one and do you actually want to pay for individual lighting of your keys maybe don't buy this then why is my mouse so big this is hilarious it's almost as good as the segue to our sponsor private internet access their VPN network spands across six continents and 91 countries letting you access your local catalog of

probably not we also have a Samsung nvme SSD that is at 1 terte killer Wi-Fi 6E for networking and of course the star of the show is our RTX 470 from envidia this only has 8 GB of vram which is questionably enough these days but it should be able to get you gaming pretty good what isn't so good though is the npu uh all of Acer's marketing material and every single laptop Maker's marketing material is AI wow AI so much of it doesn't meet the in specs Microsoft's co-pilot plus so uh I don't
know get screwed it's kind of useless now there are two panel options and we have unfortunately the worst of the two but it is still really quite good it's 1600p 120 HZ we have gsync and advanced Optimus in here and in our testing it performed really quite well Acer claims that it's a 350 niip panel but we tested it at 374 so that's borderline able to use it outside kind of brightness and the color accuracy even though the they said almost nothing about it is quite good we measured an average Delta e2000
of 1.78 which gives us about enough color accuracy to be doing professional color work on this although that said your Reds will be a little bit saturated one thing that is completely missing though is HDR support which makes sense it just simply does not get bright enough if this isn't quite enough for you there is a higher resolution higher refresh rate display which is presumably decent but we haven't measured it so this one right here decent all right let's have a look at this keyboard here
the first thing um it feels kind of strange they have a bunch of keys over on the right here like uh your Predator sense and your media Keys which shifts everything over here but your trackpad is centered so I end up just kind of on top of it why is there an avatar like it's like knockoff Master Chief anyway  this keyboard I'm going to give an astounding fine there's nothing wrong with it per se I was able to get up to full speed pretty quickly I'm not making many errors but the whole experience is
just not super enjoyable the key travel is very short we have a lot of kind of mushy feel like if you look here it doesn't take very much to flex the keyboard even though like if I push hard on it it doesn't go any further but if I push just just a little bit it moves it moves a little bit there and that's enough to kind of make it feel mushy the key consistency not great like if we look at this here the J key is kind of floppy it's easy to move around I can get that kind of below the chassis
before it actuates whereas K is really quite a good key K is doing just fine and that inconsistency is going to make your typing experience just kind of worse that said it's acceptable you'll get used to it you'll just not love it I'm giving it a B A flat B not a plus not a minus just a b still a quick Palmer ejection test since this is directly under where my hand is H the Palmer rejection seems okay enough you aren't going to get inputs if you just have your hand on top of it but
it is really easy to click the mouse and that always clicks the most so try and avoid that I don't love it that said though the trackpad itself self is quite good it isn't particularly large it's a little bit on the small side but at the same time it's using up most of the space that's available I guess all of this could have moved up it's good enough it is the sort of trackpad where when I first started using it it was not the best I was having some kind of sticking issues like
if you look here I can kind of get that  bounce you can get sort of a bounce over the track pad but once you get your hand grease on it and all of that nice finger Lube on there it works just great no more skipping around yay gross all right let's see how this does in rocket League we are currently screen recording so that will be a little bit of a performance hit but at the same time it should be fine enough and yeah we're getting 160 FPS easy we are looking at ooh 100° on the
CPU is pretty hot that isn't unheard of for gaming laptops like this like the Alienware that we just had was similar but it's not great that it's just immediately at 100° it's also just clearly reading wrong I don't think it's at 9 GHz we are in our performance mode right now and we are at about 80° on the GPU which is where it will start to get slower but it hasn't yet and also the fans are loudish but they aren't crazy like that alien wear that we had last time that I
guess we're just going to dunk on for a bit overall though this is quite a good laptop to play games on from my short bit of testing right here 120 HZ display g-sync nice and colorful I'm having a good time overall the gaming performance of this thing is quite good Labs tested it and when you have it in turbo mode where that 4070 is going up to 125 watts it was able to beat the Asus G14 and yeah basically everything all of the gaming tests this thing right here one compared to the G14 but with its ryzen
processor the Asus G14 was able to Edge out in some of our more professional benchmarks let's give crab r a listen given our last Acer laptop that we had in here my expectations are not high wow that's already on 100 H  treble that is comically lacking in volume and base and mids and in staging uh I do want to hear it without this cuz it does have some down firing speakers and it's still yeah those are abysmal we're going to compare to a MacBook Pro 14 Ju Just for a second so you can really hear just
how butt sounding these are wow yeah Acer fix it oh my God webcam it looks fine it's 1080P and I'm kind of blown out and I'm really fuzzy it's completely dying when we look towards the lights here if we go around this way I'm still completely blown out and now I'm both too dark and blown out excellent the most disappointing thing here though is that I don't see any Windows hello facial recognition or fingerprint sensors so you need to just log in like a caveman typing out your
password nine T5 screws later and we are  uh guys look at this look at this fake vents they're Liars they only have heat sink right here that explains why we're hitting 100° even though I thought that we had a freaking heat sink all the way across the back anyway there are three heat pipes here and they do do good enough of a job and we have a fair bit of heat sink on the sides and the back even if it isn't as much as I thought we had for repairability you can swap out
the Wi-Fi card you can swap out your SSD although there are no extra SSD slots and the ram is soldered down so there is no getting at that we also have a 76w battery which Acer has been able to really push to its limits in their eco mode we able to get 9 hours and 40 minutes away from the wall which is just exceptional for a laptop like this you typically see these maybe getting eight sometimes 6 seven so seeing them be able to get over 9 and 1/2 hours in this thing is incredibly impressive now can
it pass our double-sided drive test check get in here goes down yep you're all good if you want to upgrade to a double-sided drive if we look at our Walmart config for this "right here here it comes in at $1,600" for that 47d and an ultra 7 which is pretty darn good similarish laptops will be coming with a 4060 for that kind of a price but at the same time if you're willing to spend 2300 more dollars you will be able to get much better speakers and like an OLED display if that's
something that you want if you're just looking for battery life and performance though this thing's pretty darn good do you know what also is pretty darn good you thank you viewer for watching this hit like get subscribe and just have a great all day see you later
