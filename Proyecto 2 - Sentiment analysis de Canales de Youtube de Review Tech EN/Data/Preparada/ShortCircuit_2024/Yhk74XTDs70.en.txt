across the years of me unboxing chairs folks in the comments have said that my sitting posture is not so good so today we're going to be bringing in a doctor to tell me how good my seating posture really is and the chair that we're going to be doing that with is the Razer isker V2 which I have here we unboxed the first one on this channel a couple years ago enjoyed it let's take a look I'm actually daily driving a razor chair right now the fujan pro that we unboxed the last video on this channel but
what's really cool about the iser and something I haven't really seen since I did that video is their lumbar sport system which they've improved for this model so I'm really excited to see what they've got maybe I'll have to switch my chair out again I don't know we'll see this is pretty standard compared to the fujan pro and the other razor chairs that we've unboxed what I enjoy is that they have the gauntlets don't shoot from your chair no Rockets don't surf it don't sit on somebody sitting on the
chair it is time to take your throne flip the sheet to see the assembly guide or check out the video got what's inside assembly looks good looks clear let's see if I can do it all right all right everybody's got to stay organized we got our instructions there we're going to put our pieces in nice little order so we don't get confused and then build this thing back rest head pillow hey these are flat that's different I don't believe this was flat before on the old model accessories oh my God that's heavy
the instructions want you to play co-op but I'm more of a single player gamer myself so we're building this thing solo accessories open here there we go one of the things that I've liked about building razor chairs recently is that some of the screws that you need are pre-installed so there's just less that you have to deal with okay instructions number one put the casters on the base put this part goes in there okay number two this like this number three this is what I mean
about the screws being pre-installed which is great they're already right here for you waiting we need to loosen them these gloves look cool and I feel protected but I don't have a lot of grip so it's a little bit harder to unscrew these screws so we're facing that way goes like this screw everything back in step three I loosen step four I tightened this is on step five is now to   there sturdy and we loosen these same thing on the other side next step is putting the back rest onto the base of the
chair let's do it line these guys up something that's kind of neat is they've actually got a guide on the one side so not all chairs have this sometimes I struggle actually lining them up but it just slots in on the other side which lines up this side makes it really easy to install it's great that Razer includes a screwdriver but I'm going to use the LTT store.com screwdriver last thing we want to do is just put on these covers to where we were just screwing in everything and
then we're basically done beautiful nice and clean so clean and we're done and I'm ready to talk to the doc right after I tell you about today's sponsor thanks to War Thunder for sponsoring today's video War Thunder is a free-to-play comprehensive vehicular combat game there's an arsal of over 2500 different vehicles for you to Pilot War Thunder is about the details like how it feels to drive your War Machine the sound it makes and how they fall apart as you defeat your enemies their signature
x-ray damage system lets you see how the vehicle falls apart and exactly where a vehicle's hit so you can strategize for the next battle join over 70 million people across the world on PCS and consoles with crossplay at the link in the video description doctor welcome thanks for having me um I'm Dr Matthew who I'm a physical therapist and I've also been in gaming for the past eight years so part of what we do is make sure that the players and uh Pros that we work with stay healthy and be at their
best and looking at your posture and your ergonomics is a part of that people in our comments say that my posture is not very good sometimes so I I I really need your help first do you have any aches and pain I do not have any aches and pains so to the best of your abil abilities set up at whichever posture you want me to assess whether it be gaming or work let's start with controller cuz I've got a controller in hand right now yeah just assume that natural position and what I
like to look at to start is actually starting from the very bottom and are your feet supported boom yes they are very nice and I want to be able to determine the chair height if I were there I would actually kind of like look at your leg length because that can tell us sort of agnostic of whatever chair we're using what the chair height should be at to make sure that our thighs are parallel with the ground right and so yours actually seems a bit higher so lower it a little bit so that your
thighs become parallel with the ground and that's just to avoid too much pressure here at the end of your thigh distal thigh and then or too much pressure here at your butt right like if it's too high you'll put too much pressure there which can limit blood going back up to your heart or to your brain or everywhere else and that can make you tired so good so that that looks good and and you lean back so uh this is definitely good to know that that's the next part I look at which is
the back rest and lumbar support with you there I see you're obviously a little bit rounded little bit rounded little bit rounded and that's actually okay right it's okay for us to sometimes be in these postures but if I wanted to really be nitpicky and say hey like let's do optimal let's get optimal biome mechanics in Ideal World you be sitting upright so start by sitting as upright as possible and then you know let's say you weren't doing this console where would you set this lumbar support what
height would you set it at it's great question have to think about that I think a lot of people are lost right when when when they like oh how where should I even put it probably the most common is like oh let me just kind of put it where the arch of my back is that's not a bad start but there's actually a place where you can put it that makes it feel easier to sit up right right below my lower like the small of my back think about like at the top of my pelvis you want the lumbar
support to be there because it's essentially keeping you upright by maintaining that pressure there so because you actually like leaning back what I like to do is make just make sure that the lumbar support is set inward right so that it doesn't put too much pressure on your lower back can you see how far it's coming out right now I don't know if you can capture that Andy but it's it's out there yeah and so what's cool about having that ability to protrude out is if you lean back into it
it's going to feel a little bit uncomfortable over time but it actually can serve as a reminder for you to move more and they've actually shown in research that the people maybe there's people in your office that kind of fidget a lot and move those people tend to have a lower risk of developing lower back issues because they're moving more they have more frequent postro shifts so you can actually use it as a tool to say wow I know I'm going to game for the next two and a half hours let me set it
out a bit more so that I can just move more remind myself to move more interesting so you're saying you know even if I'm not going to get out of my chair and move moving within the chair and different postures is actually good for you yes exactly now let's look at the armrest right and so this one a lot of people always get really confused on where they should actually set it up you actually have a pretty decent setup right now so so what I like to do is help you understand where your shoulders
naturally rest so sit all the way up like this then you shrug your shoulders all the way up and then just let it naturally fall and that's actually the resting position of where your shoulders are going to be however because you lean back slightly that also changes right so then you can kind of fall into that natural position where you kind of roll back and same thing shrug and then let it fall and if it's coming into contact a bit sooner just lower it a little bit because you don't want your shoulders
slightly elevated yeah that makes sense I'm kind of a gremling gamer I think I uh I usually have my shoulders up I'm like it can lead to problems but you know you don't even have pain right it doesn't mean that it's going to lead to a problem for everyone if you want to use the ne cervical support you can but it's not really that necessary for most right if you lean back that like you do it can be helpful for you because it's going to naturally fill up that space that will be there so that's going to be
a nice addition for most people that like leaning back but hey when you're at work you're probably not even using it you're probably like this right do you want to check out your PC setup real quick let's do it real quick all right uh does this desk adjust yeah hold on I'm a short boy I got to lower the desk only goes up what do you mean it only goes up you're too short I'm too short for this desk are you serious that's a bro this is actually a really super good example right bring it up so your your
the armrests are level level with the desk but then my feet aren't going to touch the ground exactly exactly dude I'm sure too I have a foot rest the main and big picture thing here is if you're moving a lot and you're getting up and taking breaks every hour you don't have to change uh postures and positions I guess if there's one thing to remember we always just say you know your best posture is your next posture so just keep moving well thank you very much for your time doctor uh we'll we'll chat
soon before we bring a few more people on let's just talk about some of the adjust stability features that this chair has before we get to that the first thing would be the 4D adjustable armrest we go up and down we go forward backward we can swivel and we can go side to side for four dimensions we've got 152° of leaning back and we've got a memory foam pillow which I don't mind it's fine I'm not a big head pillow guy chairs rated for up to 300 lb and up to 200 cm tall which I
am not I am short they have a leather and a fabric variant of the chair we're sitting in the leather chair which has a different type of leather on this one compared to the V1 and it's rated to be softer and then the last and most important thing of this chair and the thing that I like the most about the iscar V1 that has been approved is the lumbar support system so both of these knobs will control the support system and what's really cool is it goes in and out it goes up and down and it goes side
to side which is really cool so like as I'm moving it is still against my back and it feels firm and it feels good so if if I'm sitting crossed leg I'm leaning like this I've got back support if I'm going like this and I'm talking to the coach which I like to talk to couches I guess I don't know uh still supported this chair whether you get the synthetic leather variant or you get the fabric variant $649 and it comes with a three-year warranty or a 5-year warranty if you sign on for their extended warranty
program now that I'm the doctor we're going to bring a few people on I'm going to roast their postures most doctors have 4 to 8 years of training I've had about 4 to 8 minutes so this is ought to be good Sven is our first uh victim or patient I mean I heard that you were chosen because you have the worst posture and Belle told you to come down here yeah that's exactly true why why why do you have bad posture what's wrong I don't know it's was probably hunched over like this how I usually sit all
right neck far forward you know just show me how you play Counter-Strike how do you sit when you play Counter Strike I mean you're tall you probably don't need the Apple box right no all right d all right let's take this apple Bo get out of here this is for short people like me all right how are we sitting here here you need some you typically sit back you do you sit in the chair when you game I try more to but as soon as I start gaming I start slowly leaning forward leaning forward so I've been
told that you don't you don't need this you don't you don't need this pillow it's gone well you don't have to sit like that you don't have to sit like that that feels terrible I mean basically if you're sitting forward you don't need the neck pillow that makes complete sense so okay we start with the feet feet are on the ground he's tall he's his legs are pretty close to perp icular I mean should we should we lower that chair a little bit I don't know we could probably we could probably lower
the chair a little bit let's lower this a little bit oh my God oh my God next up is the lumbar support system so right now how does it feel on your back feels very nice very supported very supportive is this better or worse terrible I like a lot of lumbar support okay so basically if you're leaning forward a lot you should have it further out so that it kind of corrects your back posture as you're leaning forward it makes it harder for you to sit terribly okay the other thing I got told
and actually before I tell you I need to ask you how much do you move in the chair when you're sitting in gameing are you pretty do you just Lock and Load and just go or are you like different postures I'd say move around I really like the one foot over one foot or I'll do the cross-legged too you know I got told that moving's good really I know I'm surprised moving's healthy really cuz when I sit like this for a prolonged period of time it hurts wait hold on you're sitting like that
for how long 2 3 hours oh that's bad no you're supposed to move like every hour that's bad I don't do that okay well you'll be okay you're young do you have any back problems slightly oh we didn't cover that in trining last thing Sven is raise your shoulders up drop your shoulders and where your elbows land is where your um armrest should be oh right so your armrest should be higher so like does that feel good or bad I don't like armrest well I at the chair I have at my
house I took the armrest off we didn't cover that in triny anyways do you like the chair it's better than most gaming chairs of s like yeah it's okay next our next victim I mean patient is Hoffman Hoffman take a take a seat dude take a seat how's your posture amazing do you have any back pain uh sometimes yeah okay okay we'll uh we'll try to fix that oh does it cure my back pain the chair yeah it uh it could if you sit right sit  editing stop I think Belle found me like this stop is that how
you wow this is I I don't know a lot but I don't know if this is great okay wow okay first off yeah your your feet and your legs um I mean maybe that's fine it's almost perpendicular it is fine like look my hand is straight it is fine he's telling me how to do my job all right that's fine okay lumbar lumbar so you're leaning back so it should be in a little bit more does that feel good or bad worse worse the other way had more support I think more support okay you like that does it does it go all the way
up bro I don't even know what to do you're so sludge bro I don't even know I don't even know so my this can't you need a head pillow hold on can't C my posture hold on all right how's that feel how's the head pillow it's all right it's not bad okay next thing if that's how you sit sleep on it your shoulders okay hofman can you raise your shoulders up like this and then drop them and then where do your elbows hit that's where your armrest should be oh wow you're like a magician
it's got to be lower okay well let's let's lower them dude a little biter do you use the armor can you adjust it I can adjust it for  but it's not bad I don't even know do you like the chair oh gaming chairs are kind of the same that's fine that's okay that's okay the hump feels very strong likes the hump okay yeah yeah is that a tactical you know I kind of need a new chair it's actually not bad it's strong it's it's like pushing me but it's cushion so that's it for me posture
Potter I like the chair the lumbar support system is honestly my favorite out of any chair I've sat on even a lot of the Ergo chairs that I've sat on this is more supportive but chairs are subjective so I hope you learned a thing or two and uh make sure to like the video if you liked it check out some of our other videos and we'll see you on the next one bye
