yep just like you I saw the minions Wi-Fi routers on Reddit and went those can't be real can they but then unlike you I actually bought them so here they are Bob and Kevin ready to turn your Wi-Fi evil how evil you ask Does this answer your question this piig b b banana ban oh there's a thing about me the truth is there's not a ton of information about these other than what the manufacturer publishes is on the box the Bob version is ax1 1800 so this is Wi-Fi 6 while the Kevin version is Axe
5400 so WiFi 6E other than that the Kevin version is triband which it has to be to be Wi-Fi 6E so it's got 2.4 GHz support and 5 GHz and 6 GHz each at 160 MHz Channel widths it has a 2 and 1/2 gig Uplink Port which is not necessarily surprising at this price but is a little surprising on something that I had perceived to be pretty much a novelty item typically they give no thought to Performance whatsoever but this clearly does because all we have to do is flip over one more panel and we see that it
also uses an upgraded Qualcomm processor versus the more basic uh dual core mys IIA processor on The Bob version and it's got more I guess Dam I'm assuming flash Dam doesn't really mean anything I think they mean Flash and Dam so uh has 512 megabytes of ram this side of the box is also where we find out these are designed by davink a Korean company that's been around since 2000 and specializes in business and education networking uh we've got a QR code for the installation guide and then that is
about it and online you won't find much more in the way of information compared to what they tell you on the box they are mesh supported you could have one Kevin for your internet connection and then I have a whole mesh of Bobs connected to them uh they have support for WPA 3 which we actually did a video over online as Tech tips recently and uh explained why that's very important and what's included in the box is apparently all yeah we're going to need a little bit of clarification on that so why
don't we go ahead and get oh my God it's  cute my very own Minion it's not very heavy but a wireless router doesn't necessarily need to be heavy to indicate its quality oh my God it's so cute if you want to connect more than one wired client you're going to need a network switch so you've got just the one Wan port and the one Lan Port there's a mesh button which I assume is for setup an LED which I have to assume lights up the eyes I really really hope it does and then power in oh my God the shoes are
rubber the attention to detail you guys it's so cute cute even the cable's cute look it's a Minion's cable not really expecting to find anything extra in Kevin's box but who knows he does cost $130 compared to just $69 for Bob he's a lot heavier which highlights that this is a completely different product not just two different versions of the same thing stuffed into a smaller chassis and a larger chassis this feels like it's got some heat sinks in it too oh my God his hair TFT is rubber too oh it's
probably not the eyes that light up it's probably this right here okay oh wow this is a really short ethernet cable um that's kind of a bummer hey there we go we got activity LED now well here let's let's do the setup this is pretty simple just scan this QR code to connect to it and then scan a second QR code well the easy setup kind of broke down here well we got there it turns out that whatever Apple's doing with their default DNS settings and Safari on the iPhone it
just doesn't work for this it works just fine on Android and it works just fine on a desktop or laptop so let's go ahead and check out this control panel I love that the default admin username is Bob come on how perfect is that like they really did they really did put in the work on this one guys wait what if you reconfigure SSID Z SSID 1 just shows up so now I've got Kevin sucks and I've got bobor one how do I turn how do I turn that one off oh yeah it's not secured what is going on
right now oh I should tell the people about our sponsor if you're looking for a way to quickly take care of your bits and Bobs ha manscaped is there for you their performance package 5.0 Ultra includes the lawnmower 5.0 Ultra so you can mow your lawn as well as the weed whacker 2.0 for your ears and nose so it doesn't look like a Krakens trying to escape from in there you'll even get their crop Soother and crop preserver which will keep you smelling fresh even in your nether regions elevate your
self-care game with manscaped by checking out the performance package 5.0 Ultra over at manscaped.com SL circuit and just make sure that you use code circuit to get 20% off oh and free shipping was this enabled box here before no that enable and disable thing is not here and this Supply button that is here in the easy setup is not here in the Wi-Fi settings one right guys tell me tell me what's happening right  apply the little paper airplane is apply wouldn't recommend using the Easy Wi-Fi
setup there were a couple of concerns we saw raised about the device online someone said that it doesn't support pppe so if you need that then I guess the minion router uh is not for you and more importantly a Reddit user pointed out that there's a vulnerability where the Wi-Fi passphrase is passed to the U console in plain text however it should be noted that someone would need physical access to the device in order to take advantage of that exploit so once someone's got physical access
you're pwned anyway enough chitchat though it's time for the moment you've all been waiting for is it actually a functioning Wi-Fi router it's a gigabit connection running into it half half a megabit wow uploads even better 500 megabit download 700 up very reasonable but can Kevin do better I'm not going to bother configuring everything on this one and guys I'm sure there's things we could do to tune things a little bit better but we want to see how these are going to perform out of the box because
realistically come on that is how most people buying a novelty router like this are going to use it all right not bad you can see our ISP is delivering a little bit more than gigabit on this connection unfortunately UBC is really not giving us good enough consistency in our downloads to really draw any kind of reasonable conclusion let's move the test inconsistency isn't that big of a deal though because under normal circumstances you're not going to be right next to your router anyway and
the bottom L is going to be you know what kind of connection can you get to it through a wall or whatever so we're at one wall right now let's see how  oh yeah I don't think the University of British Columbia is the problem here wow okay so then I just go through this one door oh wow this is with no wall guys look the set is right there it's like right there this is bizarre guys Kevin Kevin are you okay it probably switched over to 2.4 when I went on the other side of the door and then just didn't
grab 5 GHz or 6 GHz again ooh oh that's not good oh man I had not intended to go into Kevin's control panel but I'm going to have to do that so here's what we're going to do you're in apartment and you just don't need 2.4 GHz and we're just going to turn 2.4 off so the question we're trying to answer here is can you buy one of these for your mom or is she going to call you complaining the second she walks you know 30 ft away from it or goes into another room if you understand the compromise you're
making that 2.4 GHz isn't going to work let's go let's go again back to the other side of the door we go okay moving  seriously surprisingly this fares much better so the problem is not necessarily the wall or the distance I'm probably about the same distance from Kevin as I was before the issue seems to be the pickup pattern of the the antenna so if you live in like a row home you know like a three level but like small building man  back all right yeah like we can really
see it here so the problems are TW full one switching between different bands is handled extremely poorly now that could potentially be um exacer ated by the devices own Tendencies but whoever's fault it is it's not a good experience with the minions routers I'm assuming Bob is no better than Kevin and then problem number two is that the pickup pattern on this antenna is I don't know what word to use to describe it other than inexcusable um it worked great upstairs so it's not that it's completely unable
to punch through walls it's that the pickup pattern is really strong vertically and and yeah yeah it's all it's it's a it's a Cenna sticking out of the top of this thing and really poor horizontally so at this point in time I can't say that I can recommend the minions routers um for anything other than cuteness Factor so if you're in an extremely small space and you just want a cute little Wi-Fi access point then they're great and if you want performance then you should probably
look elsewhere like to your ISP provided access point compared to these things subscribe to Short Circuit
