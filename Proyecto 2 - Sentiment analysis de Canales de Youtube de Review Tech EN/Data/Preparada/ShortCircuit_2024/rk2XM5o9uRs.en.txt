I'm going to do something you've never seen before and I'm going to start this video sponsored by MSI with all of the worst things about the MSI claw 8 AI plus they went and they took a great looking product seriously this thing looks outstanding and they went and they bolted AI on the product name that's it that's kind of all I got because on paper the claw 8 AI plus is a huge upgrade over the original MSI claw for starters look at that screen it's eight flipping Ines and those bezels man
pretty small all right let's do a quick external tour here we got a whole lot of nothing on the bottom at the top that's right not one but two Thunderbolt four ports meaning that you could use this thing as a fully fledged PC with a thunderbolt dock we've got our volume controls headphone jack power button with fingerprint sensor pretty nice feeling shoulder and triggers she is a little bit on the heavier side but I promise the heft comes with some benefits because inside
this thing is equipped with Intel's new lunar L core Ultra 7258 V that means on top of having Intel's latest CPU architecture it uses their new ark battl Mage GPU which means that the claw has gone from clawing its way toward the competition to clawing the competition this thing looks absolutely flipping outstanding by the way I missed there's a Micro SD slot at the top on the back we've got a couple of paddle buttons as well as ample cooling intakes for the dual fan cooler nice contoured grip and
on the front we've got a couple of what look like nearly full-size joysticks oh that feels like a much improved d-pad Xbox style face buttons and of course Xbox style buttons as well as a couple buttons that we'll figure out what they do once we get this thing fired up shall we while it's booting up let's take a look at what's in the box we've got not much there's a quick start guide and a 65 W charger with integrated cable not my preferred style of charger but hey at least there's a charger in the Box oh
this is fun okay sorry we will fire it up in a second but first I want to show you guys the easy access SSD upgrade slot I'm just going to open that up with my LTT Precision screw driver set LTD store.com that's right MSI you can sponsor the video but you can't make me stop including my own stuff while we're opening it up why don't we talk specs she's got 32 gigs of LP ddr5x memory running at a whopping 85 33 megat transfers per second which is really important for both the system
responsiveness as well as GPU performance because when you've got an integrated graphics card of course it's going to be using your system memory as vram So the faster the better there she goes it is a 30 mm m.2 so you're not going to be be able to put a full siiz one in there but it is easy to access and it's 1 Tab out of the box what else is in here we've got integrated y57 and Bluetooth 5.4 we've got their new intra flow thermal design which helps keep everything cool not
just the CPU and integrated Arc GPU we've got a gigantic battery that's a big contributor to the 795 G weight that thing is 80 wat hours and MSI claims that they can get over 20 hours of battery life in endurance mode playing back video we didn't quite match that we ended up at around 17 hours but we tested it under different conditions and I got to say 17 hours is still a really impressive result oh that's still on uh especially when you consider that it Powers a larger screen than other
similar devices of course you guys are far less concerned with how long you can watch videos on it you guys are more concerned with gaming and MSI claims up to 4 hours gaming on low settings and we got nearly 2 hours under a torture test worst case scenario so I actually find that to be quite believable now let's flip things over and have a look at the screen I already told you guys it's 8 in so it's obviously flipping huge but it's even bigger than you would think because
it's 16 by10 aspect ratio 1920 x 1200 so that is a larger 8 in display than if it was 16x9 in fact it's 37% larger than the original claw it also Al hits up to 500 nits Peak brightness according to MSI and runs it up to 120 HZ with support for variable refresh rate that is a really nice display on a mobile gaming device they completely retooled their software so you can go in there and make adjustments to your power profile for instance you can here actually let's get let's get it fired up
here you can change your controller scheme you can adjust your RGB we got this AI engine thing here which as far as we can tell tries to kind of adjust the system settings depending on what applications you're running in practice we actually find it's better to just set the TDP in screen brightness according to your preference but hey AI oh which actually reminds me I am contractually obligated to tell you guys that with a dock right like Thunderbolt connect to a monitor egpu doc whatever you want this
could be one of the most affordable co-pilot plus PCS truly ready for the AI age oh man dude this is flipping wild so you can adjust your TTP you can adjust your fan speed obviously 8 watts is going to give you the longest battery life and 30 WTS is going to give you the most performance but this is wild at 17 Watts we found in almost every scenario everything other than rocket League the new claw 8 AI plus outperformed the original claw even when the original claw was at 35 Watts had half the
power yes that's what this kind of battle mage efficiency is going to do for you flipping exciting too bad Pat Ginger isn't here to see it rest in peace Pat he's actually alive but pray for him man this screen is big it's not the biggest screen on a portable gaming device but I think it's about as big as I would say is practical no I missed God I suck at this game I am like unbearably bad at this game one thing I can say for sure is that it's not msi's fault that I suck they've upgraded the holifa analogs
to and triggers they've upgraded the lb and the RB buttons they have upgraded the d-pad which actually does feel a lot better now you're definitely going to enjoy best if you have bigger hands my tiny hands MSI thank you for putting these ribs down here so you can kind of rest your fingers anywhere you want so there's kind of a spot to put your small fies if you KN and a spot to put your bigger fies if you're someone else um but it's it's definitely a heftier device oh we haven't even tried the speakers
yet almost no Distortion at full volume they don't have the highest level of clarity that I've ever seen but just by Merit of being forward- facing they sound pretty darn decent and they do shockingly well in the Lowe's MSI apparently upgraded the rubber for the speakers so make of that what you will now that's everything that I absolutely have to cover which means now I just get to play games let's fire up a class CL Shadow the Tomb Raider here we go man that's a big screen I didn't even notice
when we were playing rocket League which means that cooling solution she's quiet not just that but this machine runs so much cooler than the last generation one we kind of couldn't believe it check out these numbers from the lab really impressive okay total power 24 Watts 23 Watts 355 FPS now obviously you're like oh Shadow the Tomb Raider that's an old game 35 FPS yeah but my friends check this out it's cranked is that wild or what like seriously you guys if I turn this down to medium okay I turn this
down to medium now I'm getting over 40 FPS that is freaking crazy like yeah it's an older AAA game but this is like a real game you know there's no there's no Super Meat Boy and on a screen this size you really don't need to crank all the details you don't even need to crank the resolution like running this at a man 8 in display 720p might be a little low but I bet you could get away with like 900p all right I see super sampling as well sure yeah why not let's go quality
the smaller the screen the less you're bound to notice something like super sampling not bad not bad this is wild man if you'd shown this to me like a few years ago I've been like nah isn't how quiet that is I'm running a AAA freaking game right now can you even hear that Andy as soon as you've got game audio on you are going to literally completely  it oh I haven't even mentioned there's another version there is a 7in version that's $100 cheaper has a smaller battery and obviously doesn't have the
same screen it's 7 in and it's 1920 x 1080 I think this is the more compelling version personally but I leave that up to you oo tape to tape let's go this is such a great device to play a game like this screen a tiny bit no I can't dim the screen I like it bright yes I'll dim the screen give me a sec here's a fun fact by the way while I turned down the brightness these quick settings are just part of the Xbox game bar see that so there's all kinds of other functions in here as well oh no they got us chasing
oh here we go I'm on the Breakaway I'm on the Breakaway oh come on uh okay sorry I can turn down a bit there you good now that we're down to like 30% Andy yeah let's go man there's no way I need 17 Watts for this okay hold on a second oh yeah okay yeah I would like to see instead of having settings sort of change which settings are here um I'd like it to like open up a deeper settings menu or I mean realistically I don't even need that I just need to be able to switch between
all the different ones here like i' I'd like to have like my just give me the tdps just give me the just tell me how many just tell me how many watts it is I think that's what I would probably prefer I mean maybe that's not the best for like a more mainstream user but your mileage may vary just my T my manual TDP modes in game that's what I'd like to be able to do just so that if I don't launch the right one before I'm in game I can just quickly change it after the fact oh man I got to spend less time
trying to talk about this thing and I got to spend more time trying to win this game here where is everybody guys there's no line change just oh follow me up the ice see finally someone joins The Rush with me that's how we do it like any piece of gaming Hardware it's not going to make you a better gamer but I guess the endorsement that I can give it is the claw won't make you a worse gamer that's for sure this thing rocks uh while we wait for this to load I'd love to see
MSI introduced a TDP option between 17 watts and 30 Watts we found 17 Watts even in not the most demanding titles we saw the odd frame pacing issue it's probable that this can be addressed in drivers but it would just be nice to have an in between cuz 30 Watts great in some cases just Overkill so I'd love to have like a 25 watt or like a 22 watt was my CPU at 100% I mean yeah it kind of checks out GPU at 96% the really impressive thing is that it's still not loud can you hear it can
you see how close I am to the mic like that is that's too close you're not supposed to measure noise from that distance but like I have to get it that closer you're not going to hear it at all so you throw on a little bit of music and you're vibing that's an advantage of building a bigger device so yeah you get a little bit more weight you get a little bit more heft but you also get more room to put fat Cooling in it and a fat battery there is one uncomfortable part of this conversation 
$900 thanks for watching Short Circuit
