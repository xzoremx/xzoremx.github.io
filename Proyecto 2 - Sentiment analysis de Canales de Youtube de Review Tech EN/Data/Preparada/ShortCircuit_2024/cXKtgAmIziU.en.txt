this is the best laptop just just plain and simple for not every single use case but my use case and that's the one that matters the most to me let's have a look this is the HP dragonfly Elite and I have been using the G3 for the past year and it's it's absolutely fantastic although the new one's much better not just because it's new but it's way cheaper like $2500 cheaper like a a a lot a lot cheaper let's get into it this one's probably actually half similar but uh we can figure out what the exact spec is
this is a nice box I've never seen one of these fancy boxes before these are business laptops and you actually have to pay like an extra $10 for the premium  before Oh you can go over there for a second here we go charger nice and simple 65 wats that's being delivered over USB type-c and it's a nice little size I think also this pre premium cable here is an extra $5 if you want to pay for it unlike Dell they don't give you a dongle in the box cuz they give you IO oh I like this here they do give you the
option of from the factory it can come loaded with Linux or freedos and then you don't have to pay for the windows license and also you just don't have to deal with Microsoft at all if you don't want to the first thing that they denote number one are the internal Wireless antennas I'm sure that's the most important thing this is too long I what laptop it's too long on the paperwork but then how will the people know that this has NFC tapping area on the touchpad that's actually pretty
important if you're in like high security places I am sad though it looks like HP sent over the silver when they have this nice like dark gray version that just looks so much better okay okay  right wow they have not changed a thing which is really okay by me cuz this thing's great let's have a little look around here so first of all it comes with an all magnesium chassis that is just super rigid and also very light all right it is 1.2 kg or 2.7 lb I think that's slightly
heavier than this one actually oh no the Old One's slightly heavier must be the durn skin probably my absolute favorite thing about this laptop is that it is a thin and light but it has solid IO so here we have got Thunderbolt 4 USB type A and headphone microphone combo Jack around the other side we have Thunderbolt 4 again a 5G SIM card slot and HDMI 2.1 I have to say the inclusion of USB type A and HDMI has made my life just so much easier like it's not very hard putting a dongle in your backpack
but it's a lot easier to just just not have to use a dongle in the first place here we can see again that nice magnesium chassis it is one of the stiffest on the market it isn't quite up there with like apple or razor in terms of stiffness but I do think it is up there with them in terms of just overall feel and quality and actually I kind of like the feel of this a bit more probably my favorite feature with the design though are what they call their pillow block Corners right here
it's just nice and rounded over and every single time that I go at CES or computex to someone's booth that has a laptop I'm like hey guys that's really nice how you have sharp edges here that look like kind of cool on camera for your like marketing materials I hate it it's awful when you're like holding your laptop like this do you know how nice it is to have rounded Corners it's fantastic it's so comfortable it's actually one of my favorite features I guess we could continue talking about
the build quality of this one but I've been using this one for a year and uh how has it held up I've lightly damaged the finish in a couple spots like you can see like there a ding there couple little scratches there but overall after a year of pretty hard use no complaints the first thing that's awesome about this computer is the display so it has a 3x2 so 1920x 1280 on this one or you can get the 3000x 2000 version if you go with the OLED panel but uh I really think you should stick with the 1080 one
first of all it gets you 3 to 4 hours more battery life than OLED which is just massive absolutely huge and my favorite thing about this is definitely the battery life so I am not willing to sacrifice that for better visuals also here we have a matte display which is just there's not enough of them there's not nearly enough of them now the panel itself for watching content and creating creating content and that stuff is only okay HP advertises 400 nits Peak brightness but in our testing we are
only able to find 340 nits which is going to be noticeable that said though I have been able to use this indirect sunlight but only for like using Microsoft Word and word editing I cannot watch YouTube videos in direct sunlight also pretty awful on this panel is pixel response time we're looking at 32 to 54 milliseconds that is brutal like it's a sort of thing where like even just the mous mosing around like this I can very easily tell that the latency on this display is bad or
watching YouTube videos even I can tell at the pixel response time is just not good it's not good enough if you want to play games on this don't it's awful exter thanks to exter for sponsoring today's video their wallets are crafted with premium leather sourced from lwg gold certified tanneries can hold up to 12 cards and even come with a money strap if you're using those dollar dollar bills check out their quick card mechanism which gives you easy access to every card you need with the click of a
button it also features RFID protection so your money cards and identity are all kept safe and secure get up to 25% off during exter's Valentine day sale with code shortcircuit at the link down below so uh if the brightness isn't great and the pixel response times aren't great why am I saying this is fantastic well very simply because I can write Word documents on this for like 12 hours straight and I do not get eye strain we've got the matte display we have got just it looks like paper and it also is
color accurate to boot so we saw an average Delta e of 2.24 a Max of 4 4.42 that isn't quite the average Delta e of 2 that you would want for professional color work but I don't do that I just need to check stuff and know that it's going to be broadly accurate and this is more than good enough for that also like you could just calibrate it another reason this is in my opinion the best laptop on the market is because of the keyboard it is simply put the best there is no better keyboard on a 
opinion it's an A+ it's an A++ if I could give that normally when I'm talking about laptop keyboards sort of like an A minus is when you can get up to full speed but maybe it isn't the most satisfying that's something like the MacBook Pro it's legitimately a good keyboard if you can't type fast on it that's your problem but I just don't love it when you get into the a we're looking at like you know the stability of every single key is good the travel is good the feel is good to get that A+
you need that just extra I don't even know what you would call it but it is this keyboard right here it has almost like a desktop feel to it that I don't know how they were able to achieve but once we get our keyboard tester up and running I'm sure that it will validate me because like if we look here like the key stability is absolutely incredible I'm pushing on the corner on a lot of laptops you'll see this whole key sort of flexed down this right here I'm getting none of that the
whole key presses when you're pressing on the corner also the consistency from side to side is absolutely Flawless the force required to press these Keys is identical across pretty much the whole thing which is of course aided by the excellent chassis rigidity of this magnesium frame it is it is absolutely fantastic another thing that's great is the trackpad I don't think that it stands out a whole lot in the way that the keyboard does it's instead just great like I have never once thought
about the trackpad when I've been using the laptop because it just works it is glass topped I do wish that they had integrated Force like apple or Dell or Ms most people have Force clicking at this point and that can be quite good and I do really appreciate that you're able to tune it this uh you can't do any of that but at the same time it's accurate it's glass top it feels good to use I like it I didn't mention it before but you can plug in the power charger on either side which is just so convenient
you can be there can be there love it moving over to Performance though in here we have an Intel i7 1365 U which is 10 cores which sounds like a lot but it's actually two performance cores and eight efficiency and uh uh in my experience using a laptop which has a 1265 U which is basically the same as the 1365 U it's not particularly fast like in a lot of things like even web browsing at times can feel just a little bit slow when you compare it to other laptops like it's it's not that like it
doesn't have that like snappiness that some of them do but at the same time compared to like a dual core thin and light from a couple years ago this absolutely destroys it like if you compare this to basically any like 11th gen laptop chip this thing will on its face okay let's see here running cin bench R23 I want to beat the "i77700k that's 6,300 points and in my" mind that's like the last that was like when Intel peaked just before AMD came in and started making them look kind of
silly oh my God we just beat it all right cool this thing was able to get 7254 points in Center bench R23 and I think that there are some stupid windows is trying to update or stuff in the background at the moment but overall if like you need to export stuff on this it isn't brutal it it is still a thin and light but you can do the stuff here are the results that we got from the labs there are the graphs it's more than powerful enough for me like we can look  boom we're screen recording my laptop
now ha like this isn't anything crazy but this is a solid works model that I was able to build on this computer and not have any issues with it it's only a couple of components and they're all pretty simple but at the same time this thing can do it no problem moving on from the processor we also have 16 GB of RAM runting at 4800 megat transfers per second we have a 500 GB nvme SSD from Samsung Intel WiFi 6E love to see that and of course Iris XE Graphics uh this isn't a gaming laptop but uh we proceeded to
play games anyway this is bad I don't like it at all what I'm seeing though is that this is not a good gaming experience like aside from the frame rate only being okayish the pixel response time is just a complete noo for a game like this like it's actually hard to like figure out what's on the go everything just feels like it's in slow motion it is not enjoyable this panel is not capable of updating fast enough for gameplay like it it just feels so jelly and generally terrible don't game on it
it's an office laptop the speakers on this are from bang and Olson and they are fantastic they have been The Benchmark for the last year for pretty much all of the other laptops you guys have heard them a bunch let's just sniff them one more time that's loud wonder if they've  yep that's that's good that's good stuff right there how does it compare to the old dragonfly Elite  go it's the same which is excellent cuz I've compared this old one to a bunch of different laptops and it is very
favorable in almost every single matchup even when compared to laptops that are twice its size with twice as many speakers it's not just pretty loud and has decent extension but it has a lot of clarity so something like the MacBook Air has more base and like a bit more of a v curve whereas this right here seems a lot more focused on like Clarity of voice and stuff like that in the speaker tuning and I quite appreciate it it's it's awesome webcam it's great uh so this right here is a 1440p webcam you
very rarely see that on laptops and overall it just does an excellent job like look here it's exposing for my face we move around it is still just exposing pretty much perfectly for my face it's a little bit hot there but it probably will figure it out maybe okay it isn't but it still is doing a pretty good job also what is fantastic and I really really like about this webcam is you press right here Boop she's gone you got a tiny little shutter right here tiny little shutter that goes
across there so you know that no one's going to be spying on you and there also is a hard button for the microphone cut off and you can now probably not hear me four Torx T5 screws later and we are in thank you HP so much for making getting into this simple they can be kind of bad for sticking screws underneath this plastic foot right here and uh once you take this off once it never goes back on correctly again so thank you very much for not making us have to destroy these
in here the star of the show is the 68.4 W battery now there are other brands that have larger capacity batteries in similarly like sized and weighted laptops but hp's tuning of just all the power consumption in this is absolutely exceptional this thing right here in our endurance testing for labs was able to get 13 hours and 21 minutes now with the stress test it did die in 2 hours and 30 minutes but you realistically are not fully loading this ever I have had no trouble at all getting like a solid 12
hours of battery light outed of this and not even trying like I don't reduce the screen brightness I don't do anything it just works also you have the incredible benefit of Windows modern standby not really being an issue because uh I made the video on that this is my personal laptop I had some problems and I have a direct line to Microsoft so uh it's actually like very solved on this device specifically so uh thank you guys for solving my problem at least now for upgradeability this thing is not
fantastic we are able to replace the SSD so we can come in right here lift up this little shieldy Shield there it is so you can upgrade your storage although I would be careful if you do that because some of these drives do come encrypted and it might get really super mad at you if you swap it out just make sure that like your bit Locker settings and stuff are all sorted before you get into that also we have our 5G antenna right here we also have our Intel Wi-Fi card over here so unfortunately this is
soldered down you can't upgrade it but also I don't know if you don't want 5G anymore I guess you could throw a wireless card over here that would be kind of dumb there's no ram upgrade ability uh the cooler is not particularly large single heat pipe right here I don't really care it's a thin and light this is the only thing that matters but of course the worst thing about the old one was the price this one my old one came in at $3 $700 and that's because of like Intel vro that allows you to like manage the
device remotely your it Department can set up 40 of them at once if they want to that sort of stuff and also like Security Options and crap there's a good chance that you don't want any of that the one that we have here starts at 1769 and aspect is 2279 which is quite expensive but let's just go over to hp's website for a second and uh we can see that they say it starts at "$1,200 which is a lot a lot better let's" look at the one that I would want to purchase we can go in here Core i5 is
fine i7 is nice but I actually just don't care it's a thin and light you might get a tiny bit more battery now the most expensive option that we're going to be putting on here is the touchcreen so I really like the anti-glare touch screen that's the one that we have on both of these it is absolutely fantastic but if you don't want that you can get it cheaper if you don't go for the anti-glare and so the one that I'll  "$1,455 all right let's get a comparable" MacBook Air here we've got the M2 not
the good CPU cuz I don't know Intel is kind of slow these days you need 16 GB of memory no matter what Apple tells you they are liars if they say that 8 GB is "enough 512 GB SSD that's $1,500 so uh" yeah for that price I'm getting the HP for sure so yeah dragonfly G4 uh if you already have a G3 you're not going to upgrade most likely but probably most of you don't so if you're looking for a laptop that's thin and light and has heaps of battery and its Windows this is in my opinion the Absol best that exists
just like you're the absolute best that exists hit like get subscribed and just have a fantastic all day see you later
