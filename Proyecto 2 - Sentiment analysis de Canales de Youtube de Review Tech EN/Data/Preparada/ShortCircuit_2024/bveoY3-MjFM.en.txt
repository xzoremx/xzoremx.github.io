it is very rare that we talk about a controller because they're kind of all the same and this is the first one in the long time that has a feature that I have not seen before oh it is the Turtle Beach stealth pivot and let me show you what that means pivot it's a different controller yes this controller's gimmick is that there is two sets of buttons and analog sticks that you can rotate between depending on the genre of game you're playing uh and what I've generally found is that gimmicks suck
when you do a weird unique thing it's rare that that is done well at least the first time and so I've been excited to look at this and dreading it a little bit because Turtle Beach doesn't necessarily have the best reputation they're kind of the cheap uh headset maker for Xboxes and ps5s however first impression this is a nice controller holy crap it is chunky the shape of the body is very thick because it has to be able to fit you know the pivoting modules the Plastics feel premium
although I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the kind of extreme gamer uh accents I think it's makes sense when you're selling a premium controller but I prefer just simple quality Plastics uh that are uniform so that the hand kind of just feels normal everywhere in its default configuration it's very much like an Xbox controller to analog sticks that are hall effect uh which is very nice if you don't know what that is instead of using potentiometers that rub against each other and wear down and
cause uh stick drift longterm hall effect use magnets to detect its position and a spring to reenter the stick and so theoretically it shouldn't drift long term although the Springs can have their own set of issues but generally speaking you want hall effect you have your d-pad which is fine it's adequate for the kind of game you would play with a joystick next to it face buttons that are very traditional membrane feeling on the front we have where our screen will be if you've ever looked down at your
controller and wish we got a screen this is the controller for you you the three people that have thought that we have our start select I don't care what they call them now they're still starting select to me down here we have our input Focus button I'm not sure what that does but we will Discover it when we play with the software in the middle here we have our quick slide dial that you can assign to different functions like uh changing your volume to chat mix or just
changing your volume and whatnot uh here that looks like a share button so pretty standard configuration other than the screen and the quick slide button on the front on the top we have shoulder button triggers but we also have these trigger stops which is actually a pretty killer feature if you're someone who plays competitive games basically what that does when it's not activated you have a full trigger travel all the way down and when you activate it it's a much shorter travel so in a game where you're
constantly pulling the trigger and you want to have the fastest Reaction Time possible you won't have to travel quite as far I like actually having my aim down button be the full travel and then the trigger button just being a little clicky click on the back we have programmable buttons one on each side as well as our locks for the pivot modules you'll notice when you want to Pivot it yet you have to twist these down I don't love the way that you have to rotate the sticks every time you want to Pivot it
it feels like that's going to be a point of failure long term for the controller I might be wrong um but where everything else is rated in millions of clicks and presses I expect that to be a much lower number for the amount of times you can twist that stick before it starts to do some wonky things and in terms of General button feel it feels pretty nice the sticks have a decent amount of resistance to them they're not the kind of really cheap light controller uh although I've definitely felt heavier
sticks d-pad feels okay face buttons feel pretty nice all the little buttons feel fine the bumpers feel like a very small amount of rubber kind of going in it feels small and precise and clicky in a way that's good but it doesn't feel as satisfying as I felt on other controllers definitely not bad that kind of differenti will definitely be a preference thing the triggers are quite nice at full travel it doesn't feel like they go very far but with the Hair Stop triggers it actually doesn't feel that
different they definitely feel quality and the shape of them is quite nice I like the texture on it too um overall yeah quite a premium controller definitely for chunky hands um oh I missed something look a headphone jack big fan of headphone jacks on controllers when I play on a PC I'm often playing with the wired headphones uh and have having the ability to be further away from my desk but still use my wired headphones big plus but that's all the buttons on the regular configuration side let's see how it
feels on this side buttons feel exactly the same they feel like the resistance is a little bit different like the a button feels like it's harder to press than whatever this customizable button is this d-pad way better on this side it makes sense on this side that it's kind of a more premium d-pad as it's a primary input method it's one of those old Sega feeling ones where it's a big disc instead of the the plus sign it feels very precise very clicky you can even probably hear
it the flipping feels pretty good you can definitely over rotate it which is a little bit worrisome uh for the reliability I think it's something you're going to want to be careful on but there's kind of a satisfying click when it lands in its correct spot trying to see if there's any give even when it's locked I don't know if you can see it but the whole module is moving a little bit when I press the d-pad not ideal and it doesn't feel like the whole thing's a big mushy mess it's
definitely the kind of compromise you have to make for a gimmick of this sort overall quite premium feeling buttons uh and I'm quite satisfied and I would be pretty happy to play on this in your box you'll also have a USB cable on the box it says 3 m on the website it says 2.5 M we seem to have lost ours in the uh bustle of the LTT video that this is going to be in uh so you you keep be on the lookout for that you also get your dongle which is my preferred way to play pretty simple this one has a pairing
button which is interesting uh not much left to do but plug this thing and test it out for ourselves but first let me tell you about our sponsor thanks to War Thunder for sponsoring this video take to the skies strike from the sea and dominate on land with thousands of vehicles each modeled accurately from their real life counterparts you'll be immersed in the action thanks to authentic sound effects in-depth customization options and realistic damage modeling and the best part on top
of their PC and console versions they have an allnew mobile app for IOS and Android so you can take to the battlefield wherever you might be join over 70 million players and revel in the destruction use our Link in the description to get a welcome bonus pack that includes multiple premium Vehicles one thing I didn't point out is that it is USB type-c which is nice very standard these days uh but people seem to still find ways to mess things up so you can also see that you can charge and
play it at the same time something you think is common but it is not Universal the sticks seem to be pretty good let's test the  oops about 133% Circle error on the sticks that's not horrible out of the box that's not ideal but you can calibrate it using this Nifty screen so let's dive into the features of this screen first screen you get kind of an overview of your settings uh you can create your profiles we can configure our four buttons either our back buttons or the blue buttons that were in the top
right corner Corner um I'm more interested in these back paddles realistically what I want to do is have this be the left and right clicks I find that's a good thing for it it's a little bit confusing because this isn't mirrored uh just think about it for a second you'll get there I believe in you okay we can change our slider uh right now it's volume but we could change our mic monitor up down our mic mute game chat and our EQ I'm going to leave it at volume one thing that I would improve in
the next version of the software is when I press stuff it would show me what I'm pressing on screen just so that I can be fully aware of the stuff that's happening that's nice you can reassign one of the analog sticks to the d-pad um so if you're playing a retro Style game that doesn't have d-pad support for some reason you could actually Force the game to use your d-pad uh for that that's actually quite nice sticks left stick Dead Zone get out of here I'm buy hall effect sticks to have
freaking Dead Zone what the heck is this oh yeah so you can see the shape of the circle I'm all the way to the edge of the circle of the analog stick and it doesn't follow the circle perfectly it goes beyond the bounds of the circle so it shows you that's where the circularity is that's the kind of error that you're not really going to notice especially cuz it's pretty uh symmetrical across the whole controller Spectrum we have trigger dead zones now that's nice uh again that's not really what I'm
doing here if I was playing like a racing Sim maybe I'd want to like only have the pedal activate once I'm a little bit in it's definitely a preference thing there's actually is some games that don't have dead zones built into their interpretation of X input and sometimes it feels weird and so having the option to add Dead Zone not a bad thing what the is super human hearing we have different eqs signature sound which I'm guessing is probably just like a little bit of a base boost
there's a big b base boost there's a base and treble boost so probably just a vshape where you lose the mids and a voice boost which is probably the opposite uh the mids being boosted a little bit it is nice to know that they put a little bit of effort into the audio coming out of a controller I've put headphones into controllers that have the worst Dack I've ever heard in the entire world and I imagine this one won't be the worst and then we have RGB this is the smallest amount of RGB I
didn't even notice this RGB which is probably a good thing if you don't like the sensation of the vibration you can control it pretty granularly okay we can calibrate our controller that's quite nice is it actually calibrating or is it just testing it it doesn't seem to be doing anything okay yeah that's uh adequate software it doesn't do anything unexpected but uh it does what I need it to do other than control this light which is weird there's another feature that we're trying to get working but
seems to be uh having a little bit of issue with the software and that is a pro a mode where you toggle it and it changes the sensitivity so you can snipe better um I don't think that that's really an important feature for people I feel like that's one of those check the box as a feature sort of things but if you're someone that does like switching sensitivities for your six mid game let me know I do that for my uh my mice sometimes so maybe you're doing it for your controllers let's play a game the
vibration is bad I don't like the vibration of this control at all it feels and sounds weird just like a wimpy that's a very precise stick I can feel it's very responsive now that I've turned off The Dead Zone on the uh in the game these feel very good I'm going to be very bad cuz I don't play many shooters with a controller but the issues are not with the controller they're with me I can tell you right now this feels like a very good controller I'm going to set the hair trigger you lose a little bit
of immersion especially on something like the bo check which is is a bow and you know has like a big pull I don't think there is vibration in the triggers there's not it's certainly not resistive or adaptive like the PS5 ones where they push back against you depending on the game even though this game does support that and there's no vibration which is a feature not everyone cares about I've kind of come to love it this is a pretty solid controller it is kind of gimmicky but
it's it feels very premium and I've kind of forgotten that there even is another side these triggered feel good the sticks feel good uh let's go into a game where we're going to test out the d-pad and the face buttons a little bit more oh yeah I forgot that there's a screen on this thing you hit the quick start button and then uh you can go through your social alerts I'm guessing you connect that to Discord and it'll pop up there that uh not a cool feature like it's one of
those things where they're like we need to add more to this controller to justify its price uh I don't think I care about my controller having the latest messages for me that's what my second monitor is for and if you're buying this and don't have a second monitor that's a weird way to spend your money to be honest it's not a cheap controller we'll get to that d-pad mapping slider mapping so you can do the stuff that you're doing in the software uh in game if you lose connection you
can reconnect using that all right time to test the other side yo this d-pad is fire though I haven't played on a controller where I thought the d-pad was better than adequate in a long time I really like this side's d-pad the other side as mid as everything else really precise really clear what I'm pressing it doesn't feel like there's going to be accidental presses we're here in Street Fighter 6 yeah it's really easy with this d-pad to know exactly what I'm pressing it's very clicky very tactile
although this is clearly not the Esports way to play a fighting game this is a pretty dang good way especially because in just a couple seconds you're back to the traditional way it feels a little bit cheap to me that they have a really good controller on one side and kind of a mid one on this side I can't imagine it's that expensive to manufacture that d-pad um but I guess every penny counts Turtle Beach if you're playing wirelessly they claim you get about 20 hours of battery which is great uh
someone who plays on a PS5 I'm used to like uh three on a good day uh and so 20 is a pretty acceptable amount just charge it every couple play sessions uh we haven't talked about the different connectivity modes there's obviously Wireless either over dongle or Bluetooth you can do wired and you need to do wired if you're doing it on an Xbox um which is a bit of a shame you can use it with Android so you can actually use it with a TV which is uh interesting as more and more uh game streaming services
are offering TV apps like I noticed at the game awards yesterday Microsoft is pivoting what Xbox branding means like their their whole new thing is that you know your phone is an Xbox your TV is an Xbox because it can stream Game Pass and so this will work with that and this would be a great controller for that I think overall this is quite a nice controller especially for something that's so gimmicky I'm quite impressed with how it feels and how it plays uh and I have no real complaints except the 
$130 that's not the most you can spend on a controller but it's far from the the least and in an era where there is really good $30 controllers it can be a little bit hard to justify spending $130 on a controller that is very good uh but I don't think is better than two separate controllers that does what this does when you compare it to the elites of the world this is actually a $50 savings and I think this is way better than a Xbox Elite controller uh and the fact that
it's hall effect sticks means that they should last you longer um but there's a bunch of controller Brands out there that you may not have heard of that make really freaking good controllers and we're doing some kind of Roundup on LTT that you'll want to uh keep your eye out for and it might not have all the features but it's if you're looking for just like a no-nonsense controller there's other options but if you're someone who wants one controller that can do it all this is really good and it
is not really compromising in any meaningful way and I feel like I can recommend this controller um without any real hesitation you look at the price if that's in your range this is a pretty sweet candidate just like uh you're a pretty sweet candidate for watching this video thanks for watching short circuit if you like this video why don't you check out another one where I do something
