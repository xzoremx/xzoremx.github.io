reason number one that I don't need a new TV is that I already have a great one the Sony a95 K has a first generation Quantum do OLED panel that is bright enough to use during broad daylight while still having those Inky blacks that we all love with OLED reason number two is that Sony is almost certainly working on a successor to my new TV meet the a95 L whose main claim to fame is being according to Sony up to 200% the brightness of the last generation while also including Wi-Fi 6
they don't want me to talk about that it still has only 100 megabit wired networking but uh Hey too bad you guys are just in time grab the other end and we're going to lift the box over the top ready one 2 three lift lift LIF all right who look inside what what's inside uh oh well what that it's foam darling okay actually I need someone to crawl inside can you get that what wow this is so much easier now I can see why they had child labor how would the adults fit in the chimneys
let's have a look what we got we got two feet one for each side we got a couple little pieces of decorative plastic we probably not going to need any of that digital audio connector adapter oh it goes in it goes into a 3 and 12 mm Jack and it gives us a spiff output oh don't sound too excited hey do you guys remember remember when we called Uncle Asher and I had to put a webcam on the laptop this appears to be the solution to that it's a camera that goes on the top of your TV I really am
not sure how I feel about having a camera on my TV but as a plus it does have a physical shutter button even if that doesn't necessarily mean that these dual microphones aren't doing anything well we'll give it a shot this module also handles automatic audio adjustments and ambient light compensation but we had a way of doing that before for it was called an ambient light sensor so maybe it's a lot better I would certainly hope so really don't know how I feel about this who look at this it's
future elius and colins made an exciting discovery about my old TV what is it Colin Colin speak up he says the old one does include a camera and just I never knew which I guess is fine because if it sucks on the current one it probably sucked on that one too good to know oh okay we're doing a remote comparison behind you Len very similar to the old one except they compressed the top buttons and they added another row of Licensing fee generators I mean buttons making a return is a handy dandy
feature that I wish I was aware of before do you guys know how much time I spend looking for this remote no no it has a speaker on it all you have to do is click a thing on the TV and it makes a noise here we go there's only one button a sound will play for 2 minutes I mean eventually oh there we go that would have saved me so much time thankfully the new one has it too and now I know about it before we go any further I feel like we should talk about my top picks for you here John Stewart no problem big
fan a lot of this other stuff let's talk about Sony's Google TV implementation there's a lot of really good things about it like the ability to quickly and easily install any apps you want like the usuals your Netflix your YouTube your Plex but also pretty much anything cuz it's Flippin Android which is awesome but there are certain things that you cannot get rid of and that as far as I can tell contains some recommendations that um let's just put it this way could lead to awkward
conversations with the kids or misses see it's tuby it's this tuby thing I can't get rid of it and you can say dislike but you can't say don't show me anything from tub anymore in general the interface is pretty responsive but it is something I would like to see improved and I will not be getting that for this particular Christmas because as far as I can tell this has pretty much the same onboard processor oh yeah there we go and down  okay the new model is substantially
lighter than the old one not that that makes an enormous difference please don't roll on the TV I don't see a very big difference except the thing jig in the back and the big scat table yeah I'm noticing a little downgrade already that I'm not super happy about instead of using a standard C13 power cable for the AC in it's got whatever this is really why it doesn't even take up less space one nice thing though is the simplified IO instead of having it spread out on the
side and the bottom it's now all on the edge which I personally find quite a bit easier to access wow it's measurably thinner hey and that's in spite of the fact that they have a heat dissipating layer on this which is a big part of how they're achieving that increased brightness you can't get get them in kids sizes this was a one-off but uh Hey W hoodies 999 $49.99 something we can get a good look at back here is the built-in speakers they've got a total of four speakers and
Sony is using their screen vibration Tech that allows you to turn your TV into a center channel what's cool about that is that while they do support their proprietary input with s center speaker in from their brand receivers they also support just a simple plus minus speaker wire input which is uncharacteristically Sony it's really refreshing to see just agre to me were you kneeling on the back of the TV no were you sitting here oh okay was she editor I wouldn't describe the
quality of that Center Channel as amazing but for built-in TV speakers they're pretty darn good even though I did ultimately end up putting in a dedicated Center Channel all right we ready to fire this thing up oh I need another helper who's going to crawl back there and plug it in This TV has support for up to 4K 120 HZ HDR 10 Dolby Vision pretty flipp and awesome but we've only got two ports that are 4K 120 HZ Port 4  port a little bit more here okay apparently I didn't do a good
enough job so I said fine you can do it I guess now is as good a time as any then to tell you about our sponsor manscaped if you're looking for a way to quickly take care of your bits manscaped is on the case with their performance package 5.0 Ultra it includes the lawnmower 5.0 so you can take care of your lawn and the weed whacker 2.0 to take care of your ears and nose so it doesn't look like there's a kraken trying to get out of there you'll even get their crop Soother and crop

it if you got kids you'll get it Google Assistant I get personal results you know maybe that's the problem cuz I turned all this stuff off so that's why I'm getting like butts hanging out of everywhere on my thumbnails if anyone from Sony or Google is watching this I'd love to know what this is I just signed into my account what are you doing if this is account specific what data are you unpacking and doing anything with you're not downloading any apps I know that and if it's not specific to my
account why weren't you doing it in the background while I was typing in my username and passwords like why all right see this is how I know that they weren't installing any apps because my apps aren't here that took like four minutes see tuby it won't stop talking about tuby all right I want to see that scene where Gandalf comes back oh God that's smoothing I forgot I factory reset it so it doesn't have Brandon from labs's tweaks yet let's fix that first of all we are not going to be in Vivid
mode or actually maybe we should because we were only able to hit Sony's "advertised 2,000 nits Peak brightness in" a 1% window in Vivid mode which Brandon from the lab found to be less accurate than the professional mode Sony is doing a really good job of retaining detail in this extremely bright backlit scene obviously not as good as a mastering monitor with a third generation panel but pretty darn good considering how brightly this room is lit right now I am extremely happy
with this picture with that said once I get it dialed into the settings I would actually use I'm going to be expecting "more like 1,700 nits Peak brightness or" even a little bit less also the HDR color accuracy was okay though that's what we expect from a retail set oh this is so cool you can make adjustments app by app I actually love that so not only will it detect certain sources like say for example you plug in a PlayStation 5 it'll go oh hey games and switch everything over into
game mode but I don't remember seeing this oh they've moved some stuff around sound settings used to be here and you could have like a quick access to flip between TV sound and external audio system sound I can't say I'm a big fan of how they've rejiggered this into two different settings  menus not going to lie this thing kind of slaps that's it's starting to get a little distorted yes I'm not at Max but I wouldn't go above that on this TV anyway but that is very usable oh
interesting it not only Auto adjusts brightness according to ambient light it also adjusts color temperature which I actually definitely prefer that however this is what it's doing without the camera why don't we go ahead and throw the camera on it come here buddy am I allowed to put this on while it's powered let's hope so oh hello set up Ria cam no way detect your viewing position to optimize picture and T what would it adjust about the picture I mean this thing already
has CU OLED viewing angles I could watch it from here interesting it changes the volume balance of the left and right speakers I can't see that working with an external AVR but hey if you're only using the built-in speakers then I guess that's kind of neat okay I got to try the gesture control though gesture control ah tutorial  it slide your hand wait what oh oh oh no wait are you messing with me are you guys no okay you're  this if this is the killer app that is supposed to make me want to put a camera
on my TV if only there was some way to do this can I just demonstrate I know  done exit the short yeah I'm never going to touch that ever again cool uh what what else we got with this camera okay so if I go closer theoretically it should go dimmer okay guys this is a thing it's pretty subtle here we go finally the same piece of content on both TVs even if this  scenario if there's a difference it ain't easy to spot at least on YouTube okay are we on it what are you kidding me what just what just
happened I just want to see them side by side okay I'm not asking for that much I'm not us using this TV anymore so I guess it doesn't really matter see you later buddy forget the side by side as far as I can tell they haven't done anything in particular for the antiglare treatment but the brightness is great this is something I really like on the TCL downstairs SDR content pops like mad because it just applies kind of a um boost to the brightest parts of the frame even though there is no HDR
metadata normally it wouldn't be able to go so bright but one of my favorite movies ever How to Train Your Dragon is not available in HDR and so that boosted brightness SDR mode that the TV downstairs has is an awesome way to "enjoy it and this TV can't hit 5,000" nits Peak brightness like that one but this definitely pops more than I'm used to seeing an SDR and I'm really happy to see that it's not as good as the one downstairs that said the differences between this and last gen at least
subjectively watching it are pretty negligible so yeah if you have an older TV and you want a big picture quality upgrade you want to go QD OLED in spite of some of the software struggles you guys saw today I've actually been extremely happy with this thing and this other than moving a couple of menu items around in ways that I'm not sure I agree with appears to be more of the same truthfully if I wasn't doing it to make a video I would say that unless you're a massive copile the upgrade is not even
worth the effort of pulling the mount off the old TV and putting it on the new one let alone spending all the extra money on it oh subscribe to Short Circuit
