recently I stopped wearing my Apple watch it became quite the inconvenience having to charge it every night and then remember to put it on every morning for swirl problems so I've been looking at some Alternatives and one was this the Eevee ring a smart ring that was designed specifically with Women's Health in mind Better Health starts here I guess we'll find out soon if that's really the case we've got this cute little charging case and then underneath a manual and a charging case
cable I want to throw it so bad but I hit the TV every time first to knowe the ring comes with the charging case that's portable this is awesome if you travel frequently or on the go often and it holds up to 10 charges so when your ring does eventually die after four plus days all you need is the case and then we have this cute little charging cable which is USBC I guess USBC has become the like universal cable for most things I don't need this because the case is already
charged there we go I went for the gold ring option but Eevee also offers a rose gold and a silver option and the first thing I'd like to point out specifically about the design is that unlike its competitors it has this sort of open Gap design which allows it to adapt to everchanging bodies so if your body swells throughout the month or if you are going through a pregnancy you don't have have to worry about your ring becoming uncomfortable because it will adjust to you as somebody who wears
Rings frequently in fact I go to sleep with my rings on so I don't have to remember to put them back on in the morning I find this design quite comfortable it's a bit thicker obviously between all of the tiny dainty rings that I have but I didn't find it bothered me very much especially sleeping with it on throughout the night and exercising throughout the day it's also quite light let's weigh it and see how light it really is I hate this scale so much the tape over his eyes is just like cursed
0.008 lb 3 G that's pretty light you you said you have an aura ring to compare right wow honestly feeling them side by  too Three G they're the same uh Z zirconium Amorphis alloy based titanium zirconium based amorphous alloy titanium the outer Metal Coating is made of liquid metal which is a zirconium based amorphous alloy with a titanium PVD coating based on my experience wearing this for the past 5 days it's already scuffed so that's not a great sign but I can't expect something that
is being being worn on my hands constantly to stay 100% scuff and scratch resistant it's just a little disappointing and then in comparison to the aura ring it also has experienced some some scuffing so I would say this is something that is just to be expected over the weekend I found myself doing lots of chores and washing the dishes and it was super convenient that I didn't need to remove my ring in order to continue doing the tasks that I wanted to throughout my day uh you can
also wear it in the shower or if you wanted to go swimming I prefer to take it off when I'm in the shower because this little Gap actually tends to catch my hair which isn't a very comfortable feeling so that's the only time I found that I needed to remove my ring in order to do a daily task now it's time to get it set up with the app but first let me set you up with our sponsor thanks to vessie for sponsoring today's video vessie claims their shoes are extremely waterproof and keep your feet cool in

bessie. comom shortcircuit the first issue I ran into with my experience with the Eevee ring is that when I went to download the app on my phone it wasn't available after doing a little bit of research I found that the app was actually only available in the US and to make the matter worse it's only available on iOS but it doesn't connect with your Apple health account why so after Belle set me up with a burner phone I was able to continue my experience with the eveve ring so since
I've been using this for a few days I've already signed up with the app but the process was super simple and straightforward I would even consider it foolproof essentially you just needed to input your name your birthday your height your weight whether or not you want to track your cycle and how you identify after I completed the sign up process it prompt me to choose three goals out of five different options I chose improving my sleep tracking my moods and doing more active minutes the
other two options were tracking my cycles and uh improving my heart health so as you can see here it shows my sleep which we can go into and it will show the amount of time that I've slept each night one of my gripes with this was that I didn't find that the sleep tracking was very accurate for starters the time that I went to bed and the time that I woke up were not accurate to the actual times that I went to sleep and woke up this one says 12:08 but I actually went went to bed around 11:00
and my morning did not start at 7:01 it started closer to 7:30 or 7:45 I also woke up frequently throughout the night and it doesn't show any activity for me waking up which leads me to believe that this is a little less accurate than I would have hoped especially when the entire goal is to be more cognizant of my sleep schedule the other things to know in the Sleep section of the app is that it also tracks your sleep vitals so let's go to my sleep last night and it shows my R variability average which was
43 milliseconds as well as my blood oxygen level which is 100% I will get into how I feel about the blood oxygen uh measuring system in a second as well as my respiration rate which is about 15 RPM and my skin temperature average I do appreciate that the app shows a description for each sleep stage but it doesn't give you a descriptor for each metric I think that would be something that would be super beneficial for the app because as a normal user I'm not sure what this is supposed to
indicate to me active minutes this is another one where I found I had inconsistent readings so if I go to the active minutes portion of the app I can see what my day looks like my week looks like and my month looks like and I'm going to point out specifically on my Saturday the EV app allows you to start activities so that it can track it consistently but if you don't start activities it will make assumptions based on your movement and I have not found that to be very accurate for
example I didn't start an activity on Saturday when I went to my bar class which was an hour long and the app only tracked 30 active minutes m I also found my heart rate readings were not very accurate but it doesn't display that here because I haven't had a control like my Apple watch to compare I can't really say how accurate the steps portion of the app is but based on my experience with both the sleep and the active sections I doubt that these are as close to Accurate as you would hope
especially for something that is supposed to be giving you advice on your health uh then going into my body section it shows your activity again whether or not you have logged workouts your heart rate and spot check so spot check essentially does a quick check on your heart rate and your blood oxygen levels I've had VAR experiences with this particular portion in fact there was a point where I had tried it once and it said my blood oxygen level was below 95% which is not healthy and was
indicating to me that I needed to go see a doctor and then the second spot check I did said that I was 100 100% so let's try it again now and see what my reading is this time oh 99% yay it actually worked fairly well this time the other thing I noticed is that if it doesn't accurately read it will prompt you to put the ring between the tip of your thumb and your pointer finger to to gather the pulse uh and blood reading from your fingertips instead and the other portion is the
menstrual cycle portion for a product that is specifically aimed at Women's Health I don't find it to be very different from like the aura ring tracking system for example or even Apple cycle tracker you can log your mood and symptoms but with a product that I'm wearing constantly I don't want to have to continually have to go back to the app in order to input my energy level my mood my menstrual flow uh my symptoms Etc I didn't particularly go super in depth with this portion of the
app as my particular goals were more based around my activity and my sleep but there are other alternatives to this and I don't believe you need to buy a ring in order to track accurately we have Journal which is still this this like period tracking portion and then the goals but I don't really understand why you need to pick three out of the five goals like why can't you just do all five I am particularly sensitive about my heart health as I've talked about in the past but because it wasn't
the top priority between the three it's just not something that can be part of my goals this is fun I actually haven't seen a comparison between these two product interfaces before uh my experience with the EV app is that it's incredibly simple to use but it's not as accurate as I would hope for a product that is based around health I I do want to mention that a lot of people that I have seen talking about the EV app appreciate that it doesn't have these arbitrary scores it feels like less
pressure uh instead you're setting goals instead of trying to aim for specific numbers well I guess when you're setting goals you are still aiming for specific numbers but do you find that is like you didn't do this well uh yeah sometimes I have a lot of notifications turn off ah so while comparing you can see that there's definitely a difference in app quality the Aura app has a $599 subscription cost where the EV app is actually free so as long as you purchase the ring you can use it
freely here we have a sidebyside comparison with the Aura app and I'm going to have Belle come and explain his experience with the Ora app since I'm not familiar yeah I've been using the aura ring for quite a while like I want to say it's been about a year and the app is quite nice uh it gives you all these numbers saying you know how well you slept how hard you should go to the gym today uh tracks your steps and everything like that it definitely does have a problem of like you were saying
uh earlier that you know you see this and you kind of start to feel bad where it's like man I did not do well yesterday like that's great but it gives you things like meditation and all this kind of sites but if you don't pay the like $6 a month you get almost nothing so you have to buy the ring and subscribe otherwise this app is almost completely blank which is a big bummer and the ring costs 300 to 500 how much did you pay for yours well luckily I work here at lus Texas so uh not that
but would I pay you know $300 to $500 and $6 a month I don't know I also wear a smartwatch and though the battery life is a big pain in the butt yeah it's a huge asking cost unless you're really diving into fitness and health which uh I'm not across the board the ring cost $269 USD and because the app is only available in the US it will only ship to the US but if you want one for yourself you can't get one because they're entirely sold out I do want to mention that when we discussed doing this short
circuit I like to take a look at the product Instagram Pages just to see what their marketing looks like from a design standpoint and how people are reacting to the product in general and most of the comments were very displeased with their customer support and so once I went back to it a few days ago I noticed all of the comments were turned off that alone would lead me to not want to purchase a product like this because customer support is so important when you're spending a significant amount of
money on a product although the EV ring presents a compelling concept and strong messaging behind it akin to the medical system when it comes to Women's Healthcare it still has flaws and some things to work out I do appreciate companies looking further into Women's Health but this product is just not there yet and for that reason I probably wouldn't recommend it but using the eveve ring however has led me to look into to more Alternatives like the aura ring because it does solve the issue
that I was having with my Apple watch so hopefully I'll find something soon that fits my needs it's just not this thank you so much for watching if you want to know more of my thoughts on SmartWatches I'd recommend watching my Apple Watch series 9 video
