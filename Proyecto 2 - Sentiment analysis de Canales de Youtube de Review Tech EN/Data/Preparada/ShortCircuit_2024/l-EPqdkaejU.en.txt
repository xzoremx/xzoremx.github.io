RGB fans were pretty cool back in the Middle Ages these days we have screens on our fans or least your nand does because now all the cool kids they have the holographic fan look at this right  it can display a Persistence of vision image on your computer let's have a look let's see what we have in the Box here we have a little note with the specs 2600 RPM 52 CFM and 2.75 mm of H2O apparently the thing will do 33 DB of noise which is pretty darn good especially given that it has no pwm
we'll talk about that in a little bit also in here of course we have the fan and a couple of fan screws yeah there we go that's it some context for these specs they're perfectly fine as for the fan design itself it looks like you're a pretty typical cheap RGB fan you find a lot of these for like $34 on AliExpress or wish but this one right here is a little bit beefier looking and it has this bar right down the center how this works is the fan spins and then the lights light up in here corresponding to
where it is around here in the rotation and by using maths and Magic you're able to get an image out of that somehow let's see if we can just have it work come on do it oh that is cool wow this is a loud fan that's unfortunate I feel like their 33 DB claim is a bit of a fib so Bel just said apparently if you give it less beans it will sound better that is not a thing this right here has to spin at 2600 RPM all the time there are only two leads going to the motherboard on this which means you have no control
over the speed whatso ever and there is a good reason for that so see how we have this image right here that is based on the RPMs of the fan so if I start slowing it down you can see that the image just kind of starts to fall apart now kifi does have a new version that's going to come out that will apparently go down to about 900 RPM which should be way quieter than this but the whole maths of being able to find out like how fast it's going and turn that into a image that makes any sense at all is
pretty difficult cuz again speed changes whole thing falls apart Bell says apparently it's way quieter at 9 volts which you don't get from a computer but I'm willing to try it all right I got my sound level meter because I think their specs are horrifically wrong let's just unplug it for a second just to make sure that it's not super duper loud in here so this system is roughly we can call it 43 DB there about now now I can plug in this fan and we'll see just how much louder
it gets we're looking at about 50 DB a lot of the times I'll do it from a foot which is about right here which is 53 DB that's 20 DB more than they claim and 20 DB is a lot that's a shocking amount 3 DB is a doubling in power 20 is a lot it's logarithmic now Belle says that Reddit says that at 9 Vols this fan will be a lot quieter which makes a fair bit of sense but at the same time I suspect that's going to completely ruin our little holographic display but I'm willing to give it a try there we go
fans working off the bench power supply voltage setting nine it's not quite stable but I would say that it is good enough would you say that's good enough  working okay so it does stabiliz I guess it does have two modes you can run it at 9 volts it stabilizes itself can I go lower doesn't like eight not a fan of eight is it stabilizing no all right 9 volts does seem better the noise is much more acceptable one more thing we're going to test low noise adapter if that gets us 9 volts then we're not in a bad
spot okay when I got some low noise adapters this is basically just a resistor and in your little fan lead we're going to attach that and with any luck that will solve our ipping really freaking loud problems the noise is too low for it darn well we tried let's put them in the system I turned off the system but we still have lus on our CPU Cooler very strange even stranger that this is how I segue to our sponsor thanks to vti for sponsoring this video their Courtside Classics take a Timeless
'90s look and upgrade it with vess's diatex technology which they say is even in the most torrential downpours dry sock guaranteed it also has a soft and flexible tongue plus removable insoles so they fit your unique feet you can snag your pair today at vy.com shortcircuit or use the link in our description to get 15% off your first order at checkout this is a real pain in the butt this case was very clearly designed to have the fans on the other side and it shows cuz this is difficult there we go
all right prepare yourself for some noise oh oh hey get it why are you oh dear oh man one of them came with images on it look at that it's pretty cool so the little POV thing sticks out beyond the bounds of the fan and this case is not quite made to be in that location so uh we're going to make it be fine this is where I have to say that the LT screwdriver is not a prying tool  home just turn off the computer oh I have an idea I have an idea I have an idea there's these little screws right
here I really hope that when I undo these screws that just the plastic frame on the outside comes off and not the entire thing Perfect all right they're all working that was easy and didn't require any bending or destruction at all one thing you'll notice here is that the motherboard thinks that there are no fans attached because it does not have a pwm header or anything like that it's just two wires so we'll have to tell it to ignore that all right we are on the shortcircuit phone cuz uh my phone I
didn't want to use because you need to just sideload this app from a random link on a website fantastic and also it is named M3 3D float view sure so these fans you connect to Via wifi to control them so here we go Hollow this one they do apparently have a Windows app coming that would be nice as you can see the one in the back that came preconfigured with some cool stuff is doing cool stuff it' be nice if we could also do cool stuff on these what are all these devices I closed the app and opened it
back up and I have all of this random stuff none of which I added I was hoping that switching over to iPhone would just magically make things work but it's not okay I was able to connect to the back fan which is different than these ones and I do have control so if you look here I have got a video playing and I can hit a thing and a different video starts playing it's actually quite responsive how quickly it changes between the stuff so that's cool it would be way cooler if I could change
any of the ones in the front well I don't really know what to say I've been spending the last 20 minutes trying to get these to work I think I have connected to two of the fans but when I tried to send a new video clip to them it's just stuck at 0% uh I don't really know what to say other than this clearly should have been left in the oven quite a bit longer I do know that they're working on a version that has the 900 rpm lower limit and pwm control which would allow this to be not
super freaking loud uh also the app doesn't seem to work if there was a Windows app that would be pretty cool or any other kind of control like USB control would be nice some sort of a controller that would be pretty cool uh not using Wi-Fi would be pretty great it's disappointing coolify I was hoping for a bit better oh yeah and they're on sale right now for 4 uh I would wait for Gen 2 if this is the sort of thing that you want unless you're a real sucker for punishment and you really really
really want this right now but what I want right now is for you to hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day see you later
