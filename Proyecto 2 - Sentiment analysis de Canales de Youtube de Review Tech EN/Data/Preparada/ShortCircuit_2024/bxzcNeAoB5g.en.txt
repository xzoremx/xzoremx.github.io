I constantly complain about car manufacturers that copy Tesla and people think that that means that I hate Teslas but in fact we have the brand new model 3 Highland and it is a fantastic car it's annoying as heck I'm going to complain for this whole video but it is a fantastic car now Tesla is able to get away with all of their absolute nonsense by doing things like just very Simply Having a frunk this is the sort of thing that I was expecting for every single electric car to have when Tesla first
unveiled it and since then many do not it is very sad cuz this is an excellent amount of space where you can put things like your tow hick put a whole bag back here and also they've relocated the windshield washer fluid so you don't have to pour it into your frunk when you do that overall I think this new redesign does look really good it is obviously a Tesla but it's a bit more aggressive and it has less of that sort of bubbly look that the old one had although that said there's so many of
these around Vancouver that it's just going to look like your average pile on anyway in a couple months moving around to the side we have our power mirrors right here very nice and we also have these extra expensive rims that are also worse for your range that said they do look kind of cool and they're wrapped in two 35s that are Eevee rated and nice and quiet that is a theme with this car like this window right here you can see the double Paine glass that makes it real nice and quiet on the inside while
you're driving around one thing that isn't new but is still very strange is the just complete lack of keys that you get with this thing so you get this little card right here which you have to do that in order to lock or unlock your car and if you want to do anything else you need the app now the app is pretty cool and it does work well but this is the only car that I've ever experienced where the app is mandatory and I'm just using it for things that my keys do I would much
rather just have keys please moving to the rear of the car we have these nice redesigned tail lights and a whole bunch of mud I'm very sorry we washed this before we went out it's been raining it's muddy it's Vancouver I'm very sorry and I'm also very sorry that you can't open this Trunk by just standing here apparently that came in the last update but this car didn't get the memo apparently that said though power trunk and just loads of room in here we've got the frunk up front and then also in here
we have just a whole bunch of room I have no clue how Tesla did this because every single other manufacturer seems to be just losing cargo space in their EVS when Tesla somehow managed to just make it more spacious and generally practical than every other car on the market also in the back we have our charging cable that includes our nice little dongle so if you want a slow charger we've got that here and of course Tesla uses nacs right here which has completely won the battle in North America everyone
else is moving towards it and if you get one of these you already have it great while we're here on this rear wheel drive model you're able to get up to 170 KW of charging and that goes into a 57.5 KW hour battery which is good for about 438 km of range which is frankly incredible compared to something like the KERO EV it just completely kills it you have more power smaller battery and longer range because Tesla is just the leader in the space it's kind of just a fact hopping into the back seat we've
actually got a pretty decent amount of room back here I've got enough space for my knees my legs are a little bit high up we do have that skateboard floor but I have enough Headroom so overall it's decent enough for a short trip and if you have a longer trip there's an even better thing back here which is this 8 in display now it allows us to do lots of cool things like control the heated seats the climate from down here even move the passenger seat forward or back but the real key feature of this is
gaming what other car can do that stardew Valley in a car also back here we have two USB type- c's for charging and two cup holders for your drinks hopping into the driver's seat it is rather comfortable but not the best that I've ever experienced for this kind of a price point that said though compared to the last Model 3 it is a night and day difference in here just how good Everything feels when you're driving around the insulation in here is fantastic the suspension's way better
and it just leads to a much better Driving Experience where instead of going around kind of like it's more like cuz it's still a little bit stiff now the seats aren't the best that I've ever experienced in a car of this price point and I do kind of question the white interior that Maria's gone for oh yeah this is Maria's car she did the thumbnail for this these are going to be hard seats to keep clean but they are ventilated now as well as heated very nice and overall it's pretty good one
thing that's kind of strange is that the footw dips down sort of Right Where the pedals are to give you a little bit more room height wise but then if you move your feet back a tiny bit you're just your legs are super high up it's kind of strange also back to how Tesla has just the best packaging in the game we've got loads of storage space right in here we've got nice little covers for our cup holders but if you want that we have another great big spot right there and and up at the front we have wireless
charging for the phone which is a little bit inefficient for sure it's excellent at making your phone hot but it does at least charge it while it does that unlike some other cars now of course this being a Tesla we need to talk about screen you don't get multiple screens you don't get gauges you don't get a HUD you just get one screen that does literally everything and if it stops working then well you can do Drive select up here and your emergencies but that's about it so you better be hoping
that your model 3 doesn't pretend to be a cyber truck for a little bit and just stop working up here anyway when it does work this is overall excellent the navigation is shockingly good for something that's included in a car it isn't quite at the level of something like a Google Maps but it is really really close and in here you can do loads of fun stuff like we can go in here we can play stardo Valley like we were seeing before and a bunch of other games we have really nice integration
with all of your music apps which is pretty good and you can actually download directly to the car here I have seen some where you can't and you're just kind of screwed if you don't have any service we do also see just incredible responsiveness of all of the systems in here and for the most part everything here just works shockingly well one thing that I do wish is that a bit more of the climate controls were just set down here all the time like I really like it when the seat heaters are
just permanently down here instead of having to go to a second menu but at the same time it all is super fast it all works really quite well it's a sort of thing where you can kind of get away with having everything on a scen if it's all super Snappy and super organized and those last two bits are where the other companies seem to really fail when they try to just copy this stupid climate menu from Tesla do you know it isn't stupid though this segue to our sponsor rocket money thanks to Rocket money for

but it's also the worst system that I've ever used I really don't like when I'm say need to go forward and back and forward and back if you're like parallel parking or something like that it's just really awkward swiping it like this when you're maybe like you're turning the wheel you're moving like that you want to go back it's it's not difficult it's just worse than every other gear selector I've ever used speaking of worse than every other one that I've ever used the turn signal I want to turn
left my steering wheel currently is upside down and kind of sideways which way is left uh that one I got it oh my God that is soing stupid it's it's the point in the video you know it had to come there's noing stock for your turn signals it is actually the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a car and the person that decided that should be fired the people under them should also be fired for not telling them that it's the worst idea ever and the people above them if this
wasn't decided by Elon himself should also be fired because it is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a car it is just so so bad I constantly am going like a parking lot you're turning out you turn up to the stop sign and your steering wheel is just not in the correct position maybe if they had like three dots on left one on right you'd be able to kind of get a feel for it and be like okay it's over here three dots boom where good nope you just have to look at the direction which if you're not going
straight is not the correct direction that it's going to be pointing also say that you want to do a right turn say you need to maybe go into that lane and then make the turn but it's going to turn off your signal when you turn into that lane and then you're doing your right hand turn without a signal on or earlier today I was making a leftand turn hit the thing and then I started to turn but realized someone was coming and instinctively had my hand out to stop the stock from coming back up nope turn
signal just turned off and then I made a left hand turn without my signal on great job Tesla this is an excellent system it's the worsing thing you've ever done and that's really saying something anyway the rest of it is not all that bad I was also planning on complaining about the lack of a stock for your wipers because you know you get splashed by a truck and nah there's just a button right here it's actually perfectly fine to just have your windshield wipers be a single button you
hold it long press for your windshield washer fluid but what I am going to complain about there is that this is the worst auto wiper system that I've ever experienced and that combined with not having a stock means that I'm pressing this single wipe button a whole bunch it's been intermittently raining for the last couple of days while I've been driving this and it's just absolutely infuriating because half the time the windshield wipers won't even go and I'll just have to manually do it and the
other half of the time it'll just start absolutely ripping when there's no rain on there at all I don't understand what it's doing and they don't have different settings for the auto wipers in the menu so every single other car that I've used that has Auto wipers you can be like I want Auto wipers level one or two or three or whatever and you can kind of make it work in intermittent conditions that way this right here you have one option or if you want to manually do it you have to select it on the stupid
touch screen and it's just uh I have not had to think about my windshield wipers in a modern car for years this is the most that I have had to think about it and this is the one that should be the most automated cuz I got rid of your stupid stock uh anyway on to good things we are on a really really rough and generally awful road right now and you might notice it's not loud at all it's maybe less loud than like the eqs that we drove a little while ago it is genuinely so quiet and comfortable in here I
cannot believe it is a Tesla like we are about to hit a bunch of bumps and no rattles no Creeks you're not getting that signature Tesla that we definitely would have got in last Model 3 on a road like this and just like fantastic job to everyone that was involved with sound eding this tuning the suspension it is a true gener erational leap over the last one and I seriously commend all of the engineers involved with it it it takes what felt like kind of a dinky toy of a car before
and makes it like a proper you want to use it every single day and it is so comfortable and so enjoyable to be in here it totally changes the character of the car but that said if you don't want to just comfortably Cruise like I have been the entire time it is also a little bit of a rocket so this right here is the rear wheel drive it is the slowest one of the bunch but it still has 270 horsepower 310 ftlb of torque it can do a 0 to 60 in 5.8 seconds which is not the fastest ever but it still is pretty
darn good now one thing I have noticed is if you have pretty much any steering lock and hit the gas it's going to really throttle it back it really doesn't want you to spin those back wheels and get any sort of over steer on the go and bit fun policey but that said in a straight line this thing is incredibly competent and just so easy it really allows you to be the new BMW drivers of 20124 in the past they'd be the ones that aren't signaling and cutting you off and being now
it's the Tesla drivers cuz for one you just can't signal even if you try half the time you just don't and also it's so easy and quiet to go fast in this that you can without even really realizing it just be a complete in traffic it's really quite nice well for me not for anyone else speaking of being a the lights in this are some of the worst that I have ever experienced as someone else on the road you can immediately tell it's a Tesla at night because you are immediately blinded this
is a huge problem across the entire industry but Tesla has these really bright LED lights and everyone else seemed to think like oh maybe aiming those down and using the cameras to make sure that we don't blind everyone is a good idea and Tesla was just like what about we just put really bright lights in here and blind everyone else it I said that the suspension is a lot softer in the straight line does that make it bad in the corners no not at all this thing is shockingly competent even
though you can't really tell what's going on it kind of just sorts everything out for you so if you're looking for the most most engaging Driving Experience you're not going to get it here but if you just want to feel like you're playing a video game it is great and wow the speed it can hold through a corner is just shocking especially given that this thing has the better part of 3900 lb of Mass to move around what I was not departing the road speaking of which we should probably address full
self-driving uh it is not in this car you are able to get as a monthly subscription now for $99 down from $200 in the past and uh the owner of this simply said I tried it and it nearly killed me twice so I'm never using it again great that said the adaptive cruise in this is quite fantastic it doesn't quite match up to the Koreans Hyundai and Kia have done an excellent job recently with their tuning but this is still really good it's excellent until you get down to around like 15 10 km an hour or so
and then sometimes it'll just just hit the brakes super hard for not any real reason that I can figure out but that said it still does its job really well for the most part on the highways and stuff like that and also a pretty good time the sound system play crab rave on title now this being the rear wheel drive we only get the nine- speaker sound system but it is still still really quite good so we have four up in the front four in the back and a sub in the rear and it measures really quite
well down to about 40 HZ where it just falls off of a cliff but it still is  jam as well as good frequency response we also have very solid staging we don't have perfectly centered Center Channel vocals but it's just off to the side and I think it's pretty good from passenger seat to driver's seat so overall I am quite impressed this thing starts at around "$41,000 in the US and with savings it's" just around "$44,000 Canadian which is really quite" good for what you're getting the
insulation in here again is just incredible we've got a full panoramic roof all the way back and somehow they've made it just silent in this cabin the suspension is leagues ahead of the last gen and Tesla remains just the best electric power train on the market they've continued to just unapologetically make electric cars they haven't done anything stupid like try and make your electric car feel like it's a automatic transmission slushbox for some reason it's just nice direct
throttle everything's simple if you want something that's just super easy for getting to and from work every day you really can't do much better than this so overall Maria I think you did did an excellent job purchasing this car and an excellent job doing the thumbnail for this video and you the viewer you also did an excellent job by watching till the end hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day I'll see you later bye
