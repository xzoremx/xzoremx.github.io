it is rare that I am so excited about something that has a name so misleading Mr piie true false it is not a pie product not a raspberry or such fruit uh it is in fact a clone of the Mr fpga Project you may already know but the Mr fpga Project aims to make emulation as simple accurate and comprehensive as possible and at the core of this project has been the d10 Nano a development fpj board that is inside of every Mis system the problem with that is that since it's rise in popularity it's more than
doubled in price which made buying a Mr system uh with all the accessories which we'll get into later quite expensive until today tacky udon a retr modding console Enthusiast YouTuber has commissioned the creation of the de10 Nano clone board the Mr pie which in theory is supposed to be a drop and replac for the de10 Nano with a couple changes that actually might make it the better option even though it's less than half the price I am so excited I've been excited about this thing ever since I've
heard about it I genuinely didn't know if it was ever going to hit the market I thought that this might just be one of those not a wet dream a I guess I have to take apart one of these misters these ones are just shells um this is my personal Mister that I have for a different reason here I'm just going to pull it apart and they're the same here's the Mr piie and this is the de10 Nano uh different color PCB Green's usually the cheapest uh the io is mostly the same although the big upgrade in my opinion
is going from a barrel Jack for power to type c and that is Type C with PD so it can accept 5 to 12 volt power and it'll lower the voltage if you're giving it more than 5 volts very convenient uh especially if you start to accessoriz your Mis with a bunch of boards you could have just one USB power block and kind of split out your power that way huge fan of type-c I know that was a question uh early on but I'm glad we are doing away with the barrel Jack you'll notice a few other changes with the iio
we still have ethernet but next to that we have type c instead of mini which is a very nice upgrade I haven't had a mini device since a PS3 although I guess that is kind of retro and then we have a type A instead of micro b that one is also very nice micro B sucks micro and mini Beast suck got to say type-c for the win this side mostly the same on this side we have our type-c instead of barrel HDMI which is great I believe it's up to like about 1500p without any of the scan
line effects which is very nice and then instead of our debug we have what I can assume is some kind of serialized pins if you know what that is you let me know in terms of their primary fpga processor we have the Altera Cyclone 5 on both uh I've heard rumors that these might be poles from recycled chips but uh I haven't seen that confirmed so who knows I also haven't seen any big reliability issues except for one thing which we'll get into on the top we have the same dip switches toggles uh and then serial
connectors or the expansion ports so that you can install upgrades for Ram which is necessary for some of the consoles very nice the only thing I'll point out is that the SD card slot is the same spot on the bottom mine has its SD card in it ours we will have to configure once we've installed all the rest of our accessories let's take a look first off I glossed over it a little bit before this packaging is adorable this Master System themed inner boxes and even the PS1 inspired retro
remake logo I'm a fan of committing to the retroness let's start with the io board which at first glance looks pretty similar to the Mr add-ons similar purpose board that I have uh slightly different connections again green PCB instead of the black PCB I like the look of the black PCB a little bit more but if your case isn't transparent that isn't going to matter we have our buttons I don't want to spend the whole time comparing it there's a million options this is the Mr Pro add-on board
and the reason you would add something like this on is you know power buttons instead of having it hard switch off your Mister on and off with an external switch you can do it with this board that'll connect and control this uh using these buttons but also you can have analog output and so a big advantage of Mister is that you can get really clean digital signal to a Modern Display and so you get games rendered at their native resolution but then they're upscaled very cleanly or not even you
can even send like the native resolution through HDMI to a digital connection and then do whatever you want with it digital is great for uh signal splitting capture all kinds of stuff but there's a lot of cases if you're a retro Enthusiast you want an analog connection and that's where this VGA port comes in if you want to connect to a CRT or an older display it's a lot easier to have that conversion happen inside of the Mr Box and to have a separate box although those separate boxes can also be
excellent this gives you high quality analog video as well as 24-bit audio which is great if you want the absolute most out of these retro systems it also includes a cooling fan uh which is nice you can passively cool the Mis and I'm guessing as well the Mis pie but you need an aluminum case that has the heat sink going all the way down to spread that heat uh and even then I'm a big fan of fans and this one's an RGB one it looks like that's really nice one of the advantages of the Mr pie and that
ecosystem is that it's the cheapest of everything available and I know it's going to be compatible so you get that piece of mind my Mis doesn't need this but this one occupies one of the expansion slots to connect to the io board not a huge deal I kind of like the look of that actually it's like a tasty ass sandwich next up we have the USB expansion which adds seven USB ports with two power ones these are really really nice if you want to keep your Mis size down I used to have one that was
kind of split into two boxes where my USB hub was separate and then it's just more cables going in this is very very very clean uh these pins just go into this which is really nice oh it looks so tasty I just want to take a bite I need to install standoffs as it is right now this sandwich Bea toplin also metal touching pins on the backside is usually not ideal oh there they are there's my standoffs and my screws let's see what else is in this box we got our Wi-Fi dongle which is really nice the Mis can
actually update over the Internet so you don't have to do an SD card update each time you can also set it up as an FTP server to drag games over very easily and this will also act as a Bluetooth dongle so that you can connect your Bluetooth controllers although in terms of latency wired or a 2.4 GHz dongle will probably give you a better result but that's nice flexibility we also have our RAM upgrade I have never used a Mis without the ram expansion they are basically essential for PS1
N64 and Saturn you know all that modern fifth gen stuff that's just going to slide on there once I remember what the orientation is fist side faces outward that is so helpful take a look at that I have heard that there are QC issues with the ram in the sense that they are supposed to go up to 150 MHz and some were having troubles cracking 125 130 the good news is the response from Taki seems to be absolutely excellent they've tried to replicate the issue and the issue seems to be less a ram specific
issue and more of a combo board Ram compatibility issue they've been an absolute Champion for making sure people are getting what they pay for even though what they paying is just a fraction of what competitors are offering the last two things in our box are an acrylic base as well as a this is a really nice type c cable dang this does not have all the pins this is going to be good for power which is fantastic that's all I need for this the acrylic base is nice it allows you to run this
mis without any extra add-ons uh I would recommend in the long term getting a shell either the acrylic one that they sell for $15 uh as part of this kit or there's tons of options that exist Mr f is a pretty mature ecosystem at this point retro Castle is great I like the Mr add-on stuffs there's also the Mr multistem stuff and the nice thing is that the primary product the Mr pie will work with all of them and that's what's freaking awesome about this just cutting the cost helping the consumer making
Mister a much more attractive option for so many people man let's get this thing installed and play some games but not before I tell you about our sponsor thanks to manscape for sponsoring this video are you too hairy manscaped can help with their performance package 5.0 Ultra it includes the lawnmower 5.0 Ultra for below the belt trimming with its two interchangeable blades the weed whacker 2.0 for your ears and nose and even their crop Soother and crop preserver lotions for your aftercut care
grab their package for your package over at manscape.com circuit and use code circuit for 20% off in free shipping finishing the assembly now they include extra standoffs which is actually a very nice touch I've had the issue before where I lose a screw or something and you kind of have things floating a little more than you'd like you don't need the acrylic it looks like it has its own little feet I don't love having no case but for testing it out and taking a look at it it's pretty cool to
see all of these different pieces of tech just sandwiched together it's pretty nifty one thing I didn't mention because I thought the accessory came with this package is this blue USB port this is because this isn't actually a USB port in the sense that it carries the same data it's actually a snack port snac and this is great for latency free conversion of a an old controller to something the mister can understand there's adapters that exist that go directly from Super Nintendo port to
snack or PS1 to snack the turbo pack does come with the Super Nintendo to snack adapter as well as a shell that would definitely be the pack that I would select for myself but that is sold out and I expect that this is going to be sold out for a long time just because of the value proposition but how does it play let's find out with the Mr assembled all we had to do was follow the guide on GitHub get the software updated games that we've legally backed up onto this system and we are away
playing one of my all-time favorites unlicensed Nintendo game because this is the unboxing of the Mr pie not the pie we're not going to go too in depth into the features of the Mr ecosystem which is what this is still using that software that open source project but I can tell you it's a legless experience it's visually Flawless there's tons of options I mean let's look at it a little bit so we can change you know our aspect RTI show we can put uh different scaling modes depending on the TV I'm on I
actually like these uh HQ modes there's an hq3 mode you can get uh it's not installed by default that I actually quite like on a real CRT it kind of makes it look extra HD for some reason but it's a very much a personal preference thing and on the system level you can set direct output which means that the games will output at their native resolution meaning that you can have upscaling happen 100% outside we've done a video on the Retro tank 4K which the is a perfect pairing for you go
native resolution of your Mis HDMI to your retrotink at Native resolution and that does all the work and it gives you the best result overall but that becomes a very expensive combo the nice thing is that this is going to be cheaper than doing the original Mis and it's going to be cheaper by large amount than the Mars fpga project when that comes out there's not much to say the Mis experience is a Flawless one it takes a little bit of setup to get going but the Mr Pi Project
actually simplifies it over figuring it all out yourself all the information is in one place compatibility is in issue uh all that is worried about for you and so minimizing what I think is you know arguably the weakness of the Mis ecosystem makes this an even more compelling product let's play some Tetris attack that's going to be good for you know detecting input latency although this monitor is a very old crappy LCD monitor and has its own uh large amount of input latency put
in it's so funny there's just like sweet spots of retro things like you don't want early LCD you want late CRT and that's about it wait this is a Tetris I just love the Mis project it makes it so convenient so easy I definitely miss original Hardware a little bit I've very recently parted with a lot of my original Hardware but I think for a lot of people it's the convenience and the Simplicity of it will Trump getting old analog video formats to work with a Modern Display or
hoarding CRTs and this is really the best way to play retro games the thing I haven't really done is play more modern systems uh like this and 64 or the Saturn on a mister and so I'm very curious to try that it's been my like genesis and Super Nintendo machine for a long time I got to say Game Boy Advance games do not scale well on 1080p displays they need to be on Tiny screens speaking of that's kind of the next dream product we're waiting for on tacky they already have a switch light OLED
upgrade kit where you can convert a switch light to an OLED screen and it looks a lot better and now they have this Mr fpj clone I want them to combine and make a handheld Mister to compete with the analog pocket the analog pocket's okay but I feel like it's a little underpowered for doing some of the more heavy duty fpga stuff and so I would really like to see a portable Mis something that was really slick and easy to use uh and I think a lot of people would like that too chacky please please
like the Super Nintendo there's not too much to say about this Game Boy advanced experience it's great it's Flawless let's play something a little more challenging we now have N64 working what we had to do was configure our update all settings making sure we're getting our boot ROMs downloaded you there's screen cap of that right here that's how you do that very cool we're playing some N64 baby what I like about it too is  works I'm joking about that but like my controller just works it the rumble was
compatible like there's a lot of things that used to be a lot of problem solving and figuring out and the fact that I was able to just change one setting in a menu and then this seems to be a pretty Flawless experience although there is definitely the whatever the N64 softening filter is is Hardcore this is impressive this works pretty good I have no complaints about this although there's all the analog options uh including the new N64 one that was just announced the analog 3D where everything
just work out of the box there's something special with the Mis where you pay once and you get everything up to fifth gen and once it's working it's very easy and consistent it definitely is a little more tinkery than a lot of other Solutions including an analog pocket even jailbreaking that's an easier time than this but the value you get with this thing $160 us that's literally less than the price of just the de10 Nano and you get the whole solution minus a USB power brick uh this is absolutely fantastic
then you can buy other cases get something more custom and and fun for your setup but this is just an absolutely fantastic value a great option that is just a win-win win for consumers all across the board I am so excited that uh we got to showcase this and if this is something that interests you I highly recommend that you check it out I've had a great experience with Mr stuff and if I didn't already have my de10 Nano I would be getting one of these These are freaking sweet it's hard
to find something to complain about it's this but cheaper and uh that's great that's just awesome just like you if you like retro short circuits why not check out the one where I unbox the analog retro Duo which is the turbo Graphics very very cool I ended up getting one and then I sold it
