so far all I know is that I'm going to be trying influencer food and that at  broke that's right we've got food from 20 different influencers for lonus to eat and rate after rating lonus has to figure out which of these influencers actually made the food and if he's wrong well we add it to the blender and he drinks it at the end oh my God that's disgusting just don't be wrong no I'm not going to I'm not going to know any of this stuff oh let's start with which influencers
does lonus know okay so we got uh Hank Green Jack Septic Eye okay ah I don't know we even collabed with him I have no idea I have no idea who this is sorry everyone clearly I don't know my influencers but what I do know is this video is brought to you by ODU thanks to them we're going to have thoughts on everything we triy today summarized on a website that we easily built using Fair platform we'll also have links to all the products there as well all right bring me the first one let's do this
thing all right here's your first course a burger and cereal which makes a lot of sense oh well this is really easy it's Keith's sauce that's a strong resemblance okay this one's obvious we've got a Mr Beast Burger I feel like you guys have set them up for faillure here though I am not a fan of cold Burgers I like toppings on my Burgers  mayonnaise I'm imagining what it was like when it was BM not bad give it a six but let's see if Keith's burger sauce can change how I feel about it to
be clear this is not my favorite kind of burger it's not something I would order but to their credit meat quality seems fine it uses real cheese like if it had processed cheese on it it would immediately be able to score no higher than a three all right let's give her some hot sauce apparently it's not too hot so hopefully that's an okay amount  out that's delightful ke hot sauce man I don't know what to say other than this is delicious I feel like you cheated a little bit putting maple syrup
in it hitting my Canadian bone here but man that's a nine for me it's not spicy if you like hot sauce this is not a hot sauce it's a flavor sauce and that's has got be I mean the resemblance is striking so I guess you're Keith nice oh well this is wait well who the hell from mythical is there what is it the drawing oh come on you guys mythical could be in trouble here because I am an absolute cereal nut I eat it almost every day I will eat it for any meal and I am not into oh hold on a second puffed
corn cereal with marshmallows I can actually see the flavor on the peanut butter and honey sandwich here I'm going with mish mash wait they're all mish mash well I'm going with peanut butter and honey sandwich that is a small bag of cereal but it's like two servings for me peanut  sandwich kind of tastes like sugarcoated dog food G guys there is quite literally nothing in this I don't think I've ever seen a blank or nutrition facts m hold on it's kind of growing on me right
four and A2 here's your next course oo there's a fork involved for oh no way I love cup noodles oh it's gaming these cup noodles contain caffeine what are you kidding me we've got cup noodles we've got cup rice Master pea creamy chicken gumbo on sale good Lord they put two for sale labels on this they were really trying to get rid of it obviously that's Master P and  good slimy yet actually not that satisfying that wow that is really Bland um man we are nowhere near the fill line
in this and it still tastes like dish water it's like they tried they wanted to have a little bit of like dehydrated carrots and veggies and onion and stuff in here but they were like no master PE you get a two for the quality of the product but I'm going to give you a bonus one point for making my life easy by having your picture on the front there we go right there yeah see look look at this one look at this this got like it's got like meat and little bits of egg or something and like little bits
of shrimp or whatever like some sauce you mix that up maybe it'll have some  flavor yeah all you had to do was just get regular cup noodles without paying for the brand name one and you would have had a better experience how's the rice does the rice have caffeine in it too oh wow um that's okay I'd eat it really strong flavor not very spicy though which is a weird thing to say about Curry I don't really do Seafood so I'm just going to give this a five and call it neutral as
for this one I don't know six um it's edible but it's kind of a weird combination of flavors like it's super super flavorful like overpowering but it's not spicy like what kind of Curry is that all right this round something special it's a word from our sponsor ODU makes it easy to build a website using drag and drop elements and intuitive features the website we built to track our conclusions today was up and running in a matter of days and scheduling a call with one of their expert designers

site linked below if you want to see how easy it can be to build your own site just like we did your next course sir cookies and bars oh look it's Mr Beast again I didn't know they had cookies oh the cookies are dead yeah oh apparently they weren't very good oh yeah you suck what a weird cookie texture like it somehow manages to be both oily and dry yeah those are not very good I give these a three sorry Jimmy oh wow influencers make this really easy I was like damn what the
hell is a Mina snack love Pokey man and Darcy cool right there if you're into that kind of Oreo flavor I could see being into these they've got kind of a nice crunch got kind of a weird aftertaste like I give these five for the initial flavor but like oh man they make their way all the way down to like a four at best God damn how are these 13 Sugar by mass and still tastes like that time for sus snacks in the OG flavor no reading packaging no it takes too long oh I like reading the packaging well
they look sus I don't know what I was expecting but it sure as heck wasn't  Krispie it's a rice CIS  it Belle youing guy did you just feed me crickets it's not very good at least it's got 8 gram of protein per serving but really weird aftertaste on this one too I don't know four who the is responsible for this I have no idea let's say this guy wrong   products LT store.com all right our next round is the feasable round we have every flavor uh maybe for you to try I've rarely met
a chocolate bar that I didn't like so if Mr Beast manages to screw this up then I don't know I could be in trouble all right original chocolate which  that's pretty nice that's a decent amount of cocoa in there doesn't have that creamy Lind kind of melting texture though now de nuts with grass-fed milk hey didn't you get in trouble for the de nuts thing yeah there was a company that sold nuts called de yeah bu Reese's Pieces for the OG feasable bars here I've got to give them
credit for the flavor clearly there's a higher cocoa percentage than you would get in a lot of off-the-shelf candy bars in the US however I think they have work to do on the cream and on the texture it's got a little bit of that um that kind of advent calendar kind of plasticky to it but maybe they've improved it with their newer bars so we've got these as well oh that's very different that is a completely different product is the milk no longer grass-fed way better texture now
though interesting gone is the organic cocoa butter gone is the organic chocolate lure so what they Tred tried to do was bring an upscale product to Market using cane sugar organic chocolate liquor organic cocoa butter and what they realized is that American consumers are Philistines and would rather just have garbage so here we go sugar whole milk powder cocoa butter unsweetened chocolate natural vanilla extract this is the generic chocolate bar of all time so which one was the
best and which one was the worst on the rare occasion that I treat myself to a chocolate bar I think I would prefer the originals but realistically I don't think I would go for either of them based on how badly I've seen other people screw up cookies uh I still got to give them like a seven like they're pretty okay feel like a lot of the feedback on this is going to be like V this let's see you do it better the reality of it is I don't want to I don't want to try and make a better chocolate
bar than companies that have been doing it for a 100 years all right next round we're back to some treats all right now I know you're going to like this round because it's sour candies I love sour sour candy oh this one's from Carl he looks like if One Direction was gaming all right Carl let's do this thing how much is this Carl thing 6 bucks Canadian six that's 60 cents per gummy and what do they have like uh caffeine or something or what probably not oh color from spirulina comes from nature that's 
there not my favorite sour gummy maybe a six out of 10 but I love the packaging this is adorable glucose it sweetens and softens water it's just water LOL Ryan tryan wow this is like it's got like some wallup to it sour pink lemonade strips naturally  uh no no no they come apart they come  lemonade well I believe it has 80 % less sugar in it God why is it trendy to make candy that kind of doesn't taste very good isn't that the point of candy I don't know 5 out of 10 ooh that aftertaste though yeah Ryan
tryan look like got top left Ryan tryan got him you are correct thank you for putting a picture on your packaging I promise you guys if I ever do candy it'll be awful for you it's supposed to be okay oneup so this is the sour oneup sour challenge you need to put all three in your mouth and suck for 30 seconds without making a face then chew and swallow them I grew up on screaming blue saucers I heard they give you cancer yeah apparently you need a neutralizer an anti- sour candy drink powder
download cash app the yeah if you don't make a face for 30 seconds and you and swallow it you get cash app whatever it probably is not a thing anymore okay this has got to be bought left guy no a damn it Jack sepy no damn it let's just try the challenge e they're like fused to the  go are you chewing cuz you're not  chew this is unheard of save some for this uh blend and concoction 30 seconds two and swallow please come on I've had Warheads that are sour than that this is a tough one how much are
these there were six gummies in there so now hold on a second that is $3 per gummy are you kidding me this is a one I like them if they were cheap like I'd eat them like how how many videos are there of people like eating these and be like it's so sour tears streaming down their eyes they that's why people don't trust influencers because because it's overdone this right here short circuit this is where you can get the real Goods this is not that sour well maybe this will make your mouth water oh gamer
water oh Prime is back what does sweet otter cake batter blend taste like good  splashy $1 for the cup why by far the winner is Keith's burger sauce this is delicious I want to take this home and I want to put it on my food my spaghetti my Burgers I would put this on basically anything I would drink this burger sauce that is really good um the biggest loser I don't even remember everything wait no I lied The Biggest Loser is me for having to drink this I'm only taking one sip that is disgusting one glug one
sip one glug only oh how about this I will match whatever you drink oh deal uhoh wait wait wait wait wait hold on  is I think it needs more that is that isun no if it a if it ain't chunky it ain't uh let me grab a glass whatever this is well I'm obviously taking this no no did did the milk from the cereal end up in here no it is milky for unknown reasons sure oh my God it's  warm listen I don't want to do this on why you got to smile at me like that it's weird should we link arms like
