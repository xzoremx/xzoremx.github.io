a lot of Esports monitors are kind of stuck in the past that's why Sony sponsored this video so we could unbox their m10s a 480 HZ 27 in 1440p OLED gaming monitor that has a bunch of cool Pro features and can shrink down to a nice 24 1/2 in size for those of you major CS2 or valerant Players let's see what's in the box we've got part of the stand something I'm actually really keen on they partnered with fanatic to try to make something that's uh just perfect for Esports we'll we'll see why later
but it's really small and they have a really thin base so you can put a keyboard on it uh here's the other part the big column column also has oh it's so hard to when there's no weight on it but it's also got measurements so you can actually tick off where exactly you like all right let's find our actual panel here we've got a really small cable here for power so no C13 that's what a C7 or a C8 we've also got a display port cable uh one cool feature is that it is display port 2.1 it's only
uh br10 um I would love to see full fat bit rate but you know what the reality is DSC is pretty good um so it should be fine for the vast vast majority of you here's the other half of our power nice big power brick so it's not staying in the monitor then finally we've got a handy dandy setup guide shows that you can route some cables through the stand that's nice and it looks like a color accuracy report looks relatively good we'll get into more of what our results are there's actually they just have a
gamma curve and a grayscale tracking so I would have liked to see some kind of Delta e2000 color accuracy report but whatever we'll uh we we tested it ourselves we'll talk about that later ah here we go oh it's so thin let's get our cover off you can see here why the stand is actually so cool look how thin that is you can put a keyboard on that no problem you can get right up close it's got tons of maneuverability it's actually got 360Â° swivel wow I think that's one of the
first times I've ever seen a full 360 swivel that isn't like kind of truncated in the way that it'll go like this and it'll go like that but it's kind of stuck somewhere this is a full you can spin that all the way around you spin me right round baby uh the only thing is it can't pivot don't get me wrong it's a 480 HZ gaming monitor you're not going to want to Pivot it into portrait mode 99 times out of 100 but what if 5 years from now you're still using it and something even crazier we got we got
thousand Herz monitors now you want to turn this into like a little side portrait monitor that's not an option instead you're going to have to sell it get something else cuz uh it's just not going to Pivot for you look at how thin that panel is and then the box with all of the electronics controls and stuff it's actually pretty nice they've also got a multi-layer thermal cooling "solution this thing can do 1,300 nits" and it should keep it nice and cool one thing I forgot to mention is the level
of tilt it's actually not bad uh surprising amount of tilt up if you really wanted to I typically just kind of keep mine basically flat or maybe tilted down if they're a little higher up I'm also surprised I thought for sure just based on pictures that this would be either like really back or front heavy but it's pretty solid honestly I don't think anyone's going to like knock this over as for buttons and whatnot we've got a nice power button dedicated power button and then what appears to be
yep navigation nipple or nubbin on the back this is actually probably my favorite combination I don't like when the navigation nipples is also the power button as for I/O we've got a 3 and 12 mm headphone jack couple of usba a ports usbb two HDMI inputs One display port and then we've got our power and an extra usba that I actually like how they've labeled this it is specifically for updates so the whole shell looks pretty good but how does it look turned on let's fire it up and take a look we
got it all fired up looks pretty good let's make sure it's actually set to what we wanted to $479.99 baby 10 bit color oh I don't want 10 bit I'm an SDR I want to change this to HDR cuz with the beauty of OLED is that it looks incredible in HDR Windows not so much but as soon as we put content on I promise it'll actually look really good yeah there we go 10 bit baby 27 in is pretty typical for most of you it feels a little bit uh small to me now I'm used to a 32 in so you know we're gaming
though we're going to we're we're competitively gaming let's get this in here oh yeah and and then check this out keyboard fits right over top let's play some CS2 the nice thing about 1440p at 27 in is that you've got a pretty good pixel density it's about 110 PPI and uh this thing I'm not in it yet but it should be able to go to a cool 24 and 1/2 in mode so even though I'm this closed now that's too much but when it's down to this that should be like actually pretty okay so let's set it to our
24.5 in oh Center or bottom that's cool so you can have we'll let's see what Center looks like but it's probably right in the middle this is way better I highly recommend changing the size of the screen outside of game uh don't do it mid because you're going to end up with some really weird issues um but this honestly looks pretty cool it's pretty good you got some black bars you can put centered if you wanted to um but I'm pretty happy with it overall and I'm happy with how good the
screen looks because it's a 480 HZ OLED display so we're talking about lightning fast pixel response times I think they advertise something like 0.03 millisecond grade a gray um you've got 480 HZ so uh everything is going to be fed to you at a very quick rate to the point where like Clarity motion Clarity especially along with those near instant pixel response times it's just perfect like you flick your mouse and your screen just looks great um it's also got g-sync if you want to I think that you
know when you're rocking a 480 HZ monitor at this price point which we'll talk about in a little bit you're probably going to be using a pretty big graphics card alongside it and I don't know how much you're really going to need adaptive sync cuz you're not really going to be in the like 60 to even 120 Herz uh or 120 FPS range most of the time I think it's totally fine one thing that's really cool though if you for some reason maybe it's the contrast and you just want to boost everything you
love the look of a TN panel you can turn on FPS Pro mode which lets you practice on a simulated LC CD before you get wrecked in the next CS2 tournament everything's just kind of boosted there's not a lot of contrast if you're playing fpss and you want to see in every dark shadowed area this is probably the mode for you I don't think it looks the best but I love a lot of contrast it's an OLED panel it should be able to do like a million to1 contrast ratio with those perfectly deep blacks
especially with a 1300 it's Peak brightness rating that's strong let's try FPS Pro Plus uh this mode should highlight enemies or outline them okay we're playing Halo now where G where enemies actually have outlines to them unlike counter- strike and uh we've got the FPS Pro Plus mode turned on and I've got to say it's very noticeable how outlined they are and from a competitive standpoint okay sure I get it that's going to give you an edge but just from a visual standpoint I'm not a huge fan
but I love immersion I'm not trying to win every time whereas like but but if that's what you want it's going to help you do that this man can't hit a single shot no I hit him a bunch of times there what are you talking about sure as for just gaming on this monitor it looks really good uh I don't know how else to say it when you finally get to try OLED with a high refresh rate and HDR content it just looks incredible you have such massive contrast your scenes look perfectly highlighted where every pixel
is a dimming Zone um it's nice and sharp thanks to the decently High PPI for 1440p at 27 in and 480 HZ you're really there's not much that's faster than that there's a couple monitors at 500 and uh maybe 540 if you overclock them and that's about it right now so okay the gaming looks great but what if you're using this for more than just Esports let's check out HDR footage if you do happen to buy this as an Esports monitor there's a huge Plus in that being a nice new OLED display with micr lens array
plus the HDR experience for whether you're watching Youtube with HDR or movies or honestly most modern AAA games it's going to be really good it just looks so Crystal Clear it looks very color accurate which we'll touch on in a bit here and it's just a fantastic experience I feel like a lot of people try HDR with a bad Monitor and they don't really get it like ah it looks like weird or bright or whatever not in a good way you've really got to try it on either a high-end mini LED with a ton
of zones or OLED and that's when you'll get that real experience and you'll kind of just click with HDR once you actually experience really good HDR I find it hard to go back one great feature that they've got is their inzone Hub and it's pretty good we got our display settings display HDR Cinema game check your brightness stabilizer you know change brightness and contrast everything through nice little sliders okay setting could not be changed I that's oh that's because it's HDR you can't usually mess
with contrast and HDR that's fine those are usually set to pretty rigid standards anyway but if you're an you can do just about whatever you want change the gamma curve crank the sharpness down I don't know why you'd want to but you could brightness right here boom it takes a second to like think about it and make the changes but it does the OSD itself with a navigation nipple is perfectly serviceable for whatever reason say your computer isn't running and you want to change modes on
the OSD that's totally fine uh pretty simple system you know you just have a list and then you go over and make a selection um they have a lot of options for you in terms of testing results it ended up being pretty good and essentially hit all of what they actually stayed on the box we got about 12296 nits of Max brightness which is basically right on the money for their 1300 nits claim as for color accuracy and SDR mode we measured a very impressive Delta e2000 average of 64
with a Max of just 1.27 as for HDR hlg our best measurements were done in in cinema mode where we measured an average Delta e ITP of just 11.24 with a Max of 27.7 for that's pretty good for Delta eitp finally as for latency it's great it's an OLED it's 480 HZ we're measuring just a bit over the theoretical perfect and then when it comes to end to end it's barely adding anything so you're just going to have a really solid gaming experience and there's no way you're going to feel any kind of lag or latency
when you're trying to interface with the display the real question is how much does it cost well it's not cheap it's "$1,100 however if you basically want the" best of the best plus all of these super cool Pro features and this really Sleek stand that can do a 360Â° swivel that I haven't seen on like any other high-end display at least not nothing recent this is kind of it and if you're willing to pay for it I think it's a pretty solid buy thanks so much to Sony for sponsoring this video if you want to
