today today is a very special day for today we have a brown box on short circuit you know what that means that means networking and this is a fun one this is the oh God I don't know how to say it deio deiso I'm going to go with deiso for the rest of this video but this is a router and a pretty cool one because it's designed to run open source firmware in particular you can see it right there open sense or OPN sense however you want to say it which is a fork of pfSense and I much prefer it
over pfSense for a number of reasons but the main thing is this device is made by the company that manages the open sense open source router project it's pretty big I mean right off the bat we've got a getting started sheet of paper what does it tell you to do pre-installs with open sense Business Edition that is the commercial paid version that gives you a few extra things we'll talk about that a bit later and then we've got the power cables standard C13 to c14 because this is
meant to go in a rack I guess and pdus usually don't have normal plugs oh they do give you the normal power cables and then just a USB mini very simple packaging there's not a whole lot in here this is the DC 4280 from deio what did I say I was going to call it de deio I don't know in terms of ports we've got four sfp28 25 gig ports four SFP plus 10 GB ports and four RJ45 base 2.5 gig ports there's a USB over here we've got a console port for serial connection two power indicators for the power supplies
and I think that this is a reset button probably and then all that's left I guess is this Grill airf flow it's 3D printed though that's super cool what's around back dual redundant power supplies I mean I guess they probably are serviceable from inside but they're not hot swap they do have individual power buttons and there are two of them which is nice we've got a grounding screw and then fans a big part of the design of this thing according to their website is that they spent a bunch of
time modeling the air flow and cooling so that this could use the least amount of energy possible on cooling not being wasteful and also cooling it well because there's a fair bit of Hardware in here I guess we should just open it up right hopefully I don't break it cuz I would like to try it later I was like I'm going to be smart and bring the no to a screwdriver LT store.com that has torque spits I didn't check if they were the right torque spits the only CPU information they list is epic 3000 CPU
the fastest epic 3000 CPU available for the most demanding Network loads on this specific one so it's a 16 core dual die chip also inside is 64 GB of ddr4 memory which we are going to see in like actually seconds and a 1 TB mvme SSD which is a fair bit of storage um for a router warranty void if seal broken come on guys what is this that's a load of these are apparently development units so um it could be ever so slightly different from the production Hardware but from my understanding I believe they
did do some 3D printed stuff for this which I think is what these are that's cool wow this is very like clean I want to take the front off too cuz I can't really see everything oh God oh God there's different sizes of screws now two different types of screws is not that bad I mean there's the same threading these are just shorties beautiful hey there we go damn that's pretty we got the power supplies over here as I suspected they are internal they are not hot swap per se but they do
appear to be easily swap there's these big chunky connectors that run from each power supply to the board they do have little screws connecting them but you just disconnect those screws I imagine and it will just come out let's find out hey there we go yeah okay so those are pretty easy to swap 12 Vol 16.7 amps so that works out to like what 180 Watts or something like that 200 watts each okay cool I see what they mean about like optimized cooling hey they made their own 3D print things why what is this do
you see this this is so strange why does it have that shape does this like reduce turbulence or something I know like on their product page they have a photo of the airflow simulation like the fluid dynamics and it looks very smooth cool I guess they're 93% efficient power supplies what else we got is there anything about the cooling in here aside from just this sick photo it's a 42 DBA it's pretty quiet it's not like dead silent but if you were in an office space with some people talking you you
definitely wouldn't be able to hear it or if it's in a closet you're not going to have any issues there how do these come in what the heck oh ouchie that didn't feel very nice these bits just butt up against the motherboard and then there's nubbins that stick into the fan holes so this is just like friction vibing here cool simple I like that you don't need screwdriver to take that apart but also it was a little finicky to get in and out we got Ram here what's the ram transcend 16 GB unbuffered 3200
megat transfers per second put that back in and then what's the SSD also transcend it's a 1 TB is it like decent I don't know I'm sure it's fine there is two slots though you could put a second one in there and then like raid them that's cool I think when you install open sense there is an option to boot it from ZFS cool yeah I would slap another SSD in here although now that I'm thinking about it this is a very expensive device there probably should just be two ssds in here or at least
give you the option to order it with two there's a slot there seems like an opportunity to make some money I don't know we've got absolute chungus heat sinks over here oh hey look we can see the inside of the the duct it's a less Advanced shape than I was thinking oh look and then the fans you want to swap the fan oh just slides out of there I would like to see the CPU let's see the CPU these screws on this heat sink don't have Springs it's just hard mounted those are nonfer
screws okay great use Ferris screws they have magnetic capabilities meaning you can pick them up when you drop them hey look at that that's a CPU it's definitely like a an embedded one it's not socketed I don't think we're going to get any information by scraping off the goop but that's what it looks like do I scrape off the goop I might scrape off the goop look at that just says AMD epic you bastards it's an epic embedded 3451 max turbo frequency of 3 GHz wonderful now I need to make it have
goop again no there's lots of goop on here I'd rather just like reuse their existing goop I wouldn't recommend this usually but this is like a brand new device so it's probably fine but also don't do this let's put this back on there we go okay that's how you do that in case you were wondering okay how do I get this one out probably have to take the  that yeah there we go okay cool what is this this is an EZ e 810 C1 that makes sense the A10 this is an Intel uh Nick it's a network card for
what though all right right this is the 100 Gig network card just in chip form this Powers the 4 25 gig ports the 10 gig ports run off of the S so to my understanding along with these RJ45 ports but they needed a little more horsepower to run this 100 Gig and they're using an Intel 810 I found something that would be perfect for this um obviously our thermals just in general now are completely invalid but I've got some of the honey well PTM 7950 phase change thermal pads
that we actually sell in LTT store now uh this stuff is super cool you put it on and it's like a solid and then once it heats up it turns into a goo and kind of fills all the crevices but this stuff is like damn near indestructible I think "it can handle like 150Â° C for 1,000" hours or something crazy like that which is perfect for this application because I know that this thermal paste pad goop stuff is not going to have any problems down the road okay it's on there honey well on there there we go
okay Pro tip don't take that off other than that we got power distribution on the back that's a Nick so RAM storage power supply hookups lots of ports let's put this thing back together turn it on and uh route some packets very quickly hopefully but not before this message from our sponsor pulseway managing your it system shouldn't be difficult and our sponsor pulseway makes performing important actions on your system simpler while having complete visibility into your network from
anywhere all you need is pulseway on your phone and you can monitor manage and troubleshoot your workstations it works on any operating system so take control of your servers and it systems with pulseway today by trying out a commitment free trial at the link down below okay I think it's back together I hope seemingly I don't have any more part oh damn it I know how it gets airf flow now I wasn't really looking but these are exhaust fans which means it's going to pull in air all along the front
here all around all those ports and then it just happens to get sucked through in a few particular places now if you're wondering why I have this thing I'm not just doing a short circuit on this because it's cool I'm I'm also doing it because of that um it's because we're going to be using these as our routers for the office and I say routers because we have two of them let's turn it on very curious to see how loud this thing is hopefully we didn't modify that in anyway that's super not that loud and
there's actually quite a bit of air flow coming through this considering the noise level let's hook it up okay so ports zero is assigned to land address oh good there is actually a port labeled zero okay and Port one is assigned to W and uses DHCP to obtain an IP address so we will plug in that this is our incoming internet connection into Wan which means this box should now have internet and then we need something to plug into zero we've made some changes we now have two computers on the table
this is my test bench it's an epic 70 402p with a connectx 6 card dual 25 gig and then we have a mini form ms01 which is a 13900 H kind of laptop based little mini computer which has the same network card in it as well we're going to be using this one as like a server and this one as like a client so we can run just just a basic speed test through this box just to see what it can do cuz supposedly this thing can firewall at 60 gbit which is quite a bit it can also do threat protection at 7.5 GB which is
pretty cool like IPS IDs with presumably surcot I just want to be able to test if we can do like 50 gig between the two I don't have a way to really like easily plug in 60 gig per client into each of these and like combine those at least in a a way that will be quick for me to on set so it's just going to be 50 gig but realistically that's still a lot to be frank so let's try it now that I'm thinking about it this mini form right here I think is 600 bucks us maybe and this network card you can get used for
like a 100 bucks it has half as many ports you only have 2 25 gigs and 2 10 gigs but pretty cost effective option considering the cost of this obviously few downsides there but eh okay so this should have DHCP server on it by default hey there we go let's go through the wizard host name thicky domain name damn we'll use Google DNS it's a pretty basic Setup Wizard it's enough to get you with a DHCP range and your when connected but it's not really going to go beyond that um especially for what we're going to
try to do with bonding a bunch of connections this is uh it's pretty basic this is what open sense looks like if you're familiar with PF sense it's basically the same interface a lot of the menus are the same but you just take the menus from the top bar and bloop onto the side I personally think it's a little easier to get around and I just like the fact that it's more up to dat but I could spend literally like 3 hours going through every single menu so I'm not going to do that I'll show you a
couple quick ones we've got the dashboard here uh in firewall we can see our firewall rules I've created a couple networks already for the test we're going to do in a little bit so ignore that we've got inter spes you can list them all and set assignments you can create vlans and Aggregates and connect to VPN like open PPN or IP SEC you can control your DHCP server here this is what the settings for DHCP server look like if you've used open sense or pfSense before these will look very
familiar to you we're currently using Unbound DNS and that's what this looks like so if you're more interested in the ins and outs of open sense as a firewall and routing software there's lots of other videos we'll link to down below that are cool that give you a good overview of it but broadly it's a fast secure open source self hostable routing firewall software it should be running open sense Business Edition by default uh you can just switch it over to the non-b bus edition if you want but it
does come with a one-year license for free with it and then after that it's â¬149 you get access to a integrated goip database which you can already kind of get for free but it's just easier you get a virtualization image of it which is again just kind of easier uh open Central that could be useful for you if you have a bunch of these or even just two it's like a centralized monitoring setup so you can have multiple of them exposed in kind of one One dashboard and other than that it's basically uh a an
ebook that tells you how to use it better and a 20% discount if you want support but the other thing is you're just kind of supporting an open source project which is cool on its own we've been running the business Edition for like over a year now and not to say that we had any issues with the normal version the Community Edition um but it is nice to just kind of have a little bit more peace of mind when you're updating it knowing that it should just be fine we have everybody's favorite
Flex Optics Universal direct attach cables these things are awesome they come unprogrammed or you can order them programmed if you want you have to pay a little bit of a fee but the basic thing is you can program this cable to be recognized as any number of other vendor cables I could program this side to be Cisco and this side to be Dell and this side to be melanox whatever you want to do so that when I plug this Cable in it thinks it's a melanox cable and this side well we're
plugging into an Intel mix so I'll tell it that it's an Intel cable and both devices think that they're using supported cables they should just work it's very nice you can run into situations where if you have like let's say a Dell switch and you're having problems and you contact support they're going to see oh that's not a Dell cable sorry we we're not going to support that this way they don't know not that I'm endorsing line to your support reps but it's a it's a consideration so let's
program some uh they put little stickers on here so you can tell which side is which if you program them differently if you plug a fiber transceiver into the flex box it'll actually tell you the light levels so you can also use it as like a uh a light meter if you're having problems with your fiber you think you're not getting enough gain you just plug it in to whatever transceiver you're using and it'll tell you exactly we've got everything cabled up with two of our 20 5 gig Flex optics cables to
each computer our minis for them and my test bench I've installed proxmox 8.1 on both of them and set up a container each with its own network so we've got really four networks one per cable here then I installed I perf and started running it so now in theory I see blinking lights there is traffic on all four Nicks so if we go to our dashboard Here There You Go 25 gig in on each interface 25 gig out that's total 50 gigabit that's uh that's a fair bit of traffic I mean considering we're at
209% CPU usage mind you this is with an "MTU of 9,000 I suspect if we went to a" normal MTU uh which is like the max packet size you would probably have quite a bit more CPU usage uh it is going through the firewall it is passing rules we're technically passing traffic kind of like inter VLAN routing but really it's inter Network routing inter subnet routing because each of these is its own subnet SL Network um the traffic has to get pasted look at all those packets they're routing to places I mean
in terms of the rest of it clearly it's it's quite fast um it's not getting any louder I think my test bench is louder the knct to a fans on there I I don't I don't notice any sort of ramp up if we go to temperatures says it's vibing at like 50Â° C that's not bad remember we did take the heat sink off so those numbers mean pretty much nothing yeah it's a router it rips the hardware is pretty cool I like that it's built by a company that makes cool software I do wish it had two ssds though I guess I
haven't said the price yet uh it's "â¬6,000 which" isoo that's a lot of money when you compare to other offerings like if you were to buy a fortigate for instance that can do similar throughput you know it it's not out to lunch but it is it's a fair bit of money especially considering this minis Forum right here if you're to buy that with 32 gigs of RAM and a 1 terabyte SSD it's $830 plus you buy like a dual Port 25 gig Nick or you could do 100 Gig Nick and split that into 425 gigs like this
box has um you know you're looking at "1,000 maybe" "$1,200 it's a hefty premium to pay I" don't know that I would buy a product like this for me it's always been very much a DIY approach but it's still very cool cool and it's awesome to see a company that we like that makes good software make some cool Hardware
