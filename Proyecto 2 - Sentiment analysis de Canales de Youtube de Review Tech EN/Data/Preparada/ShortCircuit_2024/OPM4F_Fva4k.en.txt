Sony sponsored this short to find what people are listening to so let's see if we can find someone to ask sir what are you listening to uh I'm listening to the W show Welcome to the W show sir what are you listening to 10 hours of Silence occasionally interrupted by metal pipes clanging what are you listening to huh what are you listening to oh the Sony link buds fit yeah they're really really cool they got like 5.5 hours batter life in the buds but then they got like 21
hours in the case and if you put them in for like 3 minutes you'll get a whole like another hour of listening time no I meant like what music are you listening to it's great because I have them in my head ears all the time cuz they're so comfy cuz they got these like air cushion things so they stay right in my ear without like having to dig way deep in there you can change out different parts of them but I kind of like the green already the marble green so I kind of just wear them in the nude you know
I'm not asking one of my favorite Parts is that they have the same great sonyc that you'd expect but it automatically changes in case you're in like a noisy like area or if it's a quiet area it's like less and I only got them for like 200 bucks the only like buds sound awesome but I'm trying to ask what song you're listening to oh
