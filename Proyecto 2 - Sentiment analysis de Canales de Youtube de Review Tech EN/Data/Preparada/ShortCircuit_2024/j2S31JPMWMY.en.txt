2 and 1/2 years ago we launched the LT backpack which has been a huge success "for us delighting almost 50,000 Tech" enthusiasts but just because it was successful doesn't mean it's perfect where does my umbrella go in the allnew LT commuter backpack which I first teased to you guys about 6 months ago when I was walking the streets of Taiwan in a nutshell the commuter backpack takes everything that was great about the original LT backpack and puts it in a smaller more stylish package the best
part is that if you buy it through YouTube shopping right now you will get $30 off while supplies last look at that thing looking at them side by side you wouldn't even believe that this has 20 L of capacity and because we moved the water bottle holder to the outside while also doubling it up on the other side to hold an umbrella or foldable cane you give up surprisingly little in terms of the total carrying capacity now obviously we had to make some cuts to hit the lower price Point gone are our
trademark Carabiner Clips but when it comes to Quality we remain as uncompromising as ever it's made of the same reprieve fabric that's manufactured from recycled water bottles and happens to be water resistant it uses YKK water resistant zippers with a custom LTT pull and it has a dual riveted reinforced handle meaning that you can load this thing up with as much as you could freaking want and hang it by the handle every day without worrying about it ripping off our custom molded foam
padded shoulder straps make a return this time with a a new contoured shape that helps to accommodate narrower as well as wider frames and keeping with that theme of quality we've gone with metal adjustment straps here and a yes certified dual layer bottom meaning that if you're the kind of person who's like me and gets home at the end of the day and just slides your backpack across the floor even if you wear through that bottom layer there will be another one there to help you out and there's so
much to say about this we added multiple attach points for the chest drop depending on your preference or if you just want to hang other accessories off of the bag we upgraded the material that covers the custom molded back foam we added a tighter luggage strap so it shouldn't flop around and of course making a return is our RFID blocking hidden Pocket in the back for your passport or your wallet since we're down here the bottoms of the straps are also rivet reinforced and this is cool if
you're not that into the whole water bottle thing on the side more hidden pockets for extra capacity here's mine I use it for my mouse Boop can't even tell it's in there I guess on the subject of my personal bag now is as good a time as any to show you guys how I load it out by transferring everything over to this brand new one we'll start with the sunglasses pocket which of course uses a nice soft micro suede material that's not going to scratch your lenses then keeping with the theme of keeping your
stuff protected we've got this awesome laptop pouch the team works really hard to have the water bottle holders on both sides of the bag while also allowing this zipper to come all the way down so you can really see what you're doing in here we use a combination of our standard rip stop material and a screen safe micro suede to ensure that your devices all stay safe when you're carrying them also this is great both of the pockets are suspended a little bit above the bottom of the bag so even when
you've got your devices in there if you set your bag down hard you don't have to worry about them taking any damage also in here we've got a nice little zipper pouch in the bottom for living that dongle life and a couple of pouches for things like battery Banks wall Chargers and cables nice it isn't completely without compromise unlike the original LTT backpack which can fit even some 17 or 18-in class laptops this one is designed to fit most 15.4 and some 16s like the MacBook Pro 16 but is really
most comfortable with a 13 or a 14 now let's whip open our classic bag of holding which by the way also has a super low zipper so you can get it open and get your stuff out like your convenient LTT Tech sack packing materials we try to minimize plastic packaging turns out they're still the way that makes the most sense for stuff like this oh before I put this in more Pockets zipper pocket on the bottom I like to keep my valuables down there but apparently we're calling it a
snack pocket so you can put whatever you want down there screwdriver pocket complete with our trademark zipper just in case you accidentally drop a bit or something into the bottom of it Pen pocket for your bolt action scribe driver pen LTT store.com and then the rest of this is kind of up to you I keep some chapstick portable SSD an amulet to protect me from 5G extra SD card the sky's kind of the limit if you have anything that you really don't want to come out though one of these flaps is
magnetic pretty nice little addition oh yes the bag of holding portion makes a triumphant return from our original backpack allowing you to pack it with pretty much whatever you're going to need I've got my tech saac in there I've got my hoodie and that's pretty much it wait where is the air tag pocket again oh hold on we've got a little spot here to put your keys metal of course cuz we like building stuff that lasts and us there it is right up there slip your air tag in there and unless they've watched
this video a wouldbe backpack Thief is unlikely to find it by the way the team asked me to point out that this is a really good spot to put your mouse cuz it's a stretchy pocket compared to the rip stop material that we're using on all of the other ones there's a lot more to tell you guys but first I got to tell you about our sponsor for this video Shopify who we've been using for LTT store.com since 2019 thanks to their intuitive tools and robust features we've been able to
