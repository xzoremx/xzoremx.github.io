if you have no idea what these products are I don't blame you I mean obviously they're headphones and they're clearly made by nothing but the naming scheme guys the naming scheme you can't have a product called the nothing ear and then nothing ear to and then follow it up with the nothing ear and then nothing ear a how does this fit in the product stack they say this is supposed to help improve Clarity included accessories are a little tiny USBC cable three different sizes of ear tips but silly names aside
there's a lot to like here priced at $99 and $149 these things supposedly pack a ton of performance into a very reasonable size package if I was nothing I'd be saying it's going to be a whole new era okay in all seriousness though hold on a second hold on a second before we play around too much with these things let's talk about the differences between the two SKS they both offer over 8 hours of playback if you have active noise cancellation off and only about half of that if you have active noise
cancellation on and it's even less if you're on the phone so while the active noise cancellation has been described as pretty darn good although not on par with the airpods pros it is going to come at a significant cost for battery life both of them run for about 40 hours if you include the batteries in the case and you don't havec enabled and both are compatible with the nothing X app which can be used to tune the EQ profiles which is by the way something you're probably going to want to do given that
they're a little on the base heavy side out of the box even if their overall Clarity is actually quite nice and very competitive with even higher end audio brands for the price by the way shout out headphones.com for putting together these frequency response curves for us if you guys want to check those out we're going to have them linked down below now let's talk about some differences the ear A's the less expensive ones are available in this fun yellow color so you could look fun like
this while the ears are only available in their classic colors although I got to say I am loving their industrial design on these things they're apparently using a super super clear plastic some kind of polyurethane material that gives it a very glass-like transparency of about what is it 89% also inside it's got ceramic drivers rather than the more traditional drivers in the E A and in practice we did find that this improved Clarity and the Sound Stage though by 50% cuz we're going from $99 to
$150 n that's a lot tougher of a sell but definitely some improvement of course I haven't listened to them yet this is all notes from the labs and from headphones.com so far got to say I am not finding the case to be the most intuitive thing in the world but it's not bad I think I could get used to it and it's pretty packable it's bulkier yep definitely bulkier man if it was me just for the size of the case alone I think I would be leaning toward the ear A's speaking of cases the ears
are ip55 rated which honestly I find kind of hard to believe like this doesn't seem to have any kind of meaningful seal in it I don't see how it's going to keep any water out uh whereas the ear 2 H whereas the ear is see I don't know what to call these things oh you had a perfectly good naming scheme sort of is and then you've made it even worse sorry the ear A's are ipx2 anyway they both have USBC charging and will get you about 10 hours of playback on 10 minutes of charging which is
pretty good as far as fast charging goes and the ears have wireless charging at 2 and 1/2 Watts so if you want to vampiric sap power off of your phone then you can absolutely do that or you could just use a wireless charger I guess that's also an option can I just say shout out having a pairing button like seriously I hate obviously it works fine but I hate having to go dig up the manual for my freaking wireless headphones every time I want to connect them I have to have
them in the case and you have to like press on one of them or something I can never remember like apple has made it clear they will eliminate buttons whenever possible even they have a pairing button so just include it oh wow that active noise cancellation is not bad um hold on a second first let me just have a look at oh oh there's squeeze it makes a little breathing noise oh that's weird like someone breathing in your ear noise uh hopefully that's something you can configure nice
clear indicators for the sides are nice to see too look at that big red dot big white dot Big Red Dot big white dot actually they wow those really stay in very comfortable for me although some folks did complain that they didn't have enough assortment of ear tip sizes I'm finding the mediums perfect for me though you can configure the controls for them so single pinch is not configurable that's how you answer calls and all that but you can long press you can double press and hold oo you can
configure that to some action on the right I've got noise control and then on the left I've got Voice Assistant which can apparently include chat GPT that's been preconfigured for me on the white one so maybe we'll try that in a minute and this is a funny one headphones.com pointed out that turning Bas enhance off doesn't seem to work for now but turning it on and all the way to the lowest will serve to turn the base down a little bit compared to what is the default low leg
mode will apparently enable by default when you're in game mode and achieves about 100 milliseconds of latency it said 112 that sounds like a because it is but realistically Bluetooth 5.3 hasn't got any magic bullet to solve audio latency once and for all this is cool their ANC includes a fit test so it can actually compensate if there's louder noises or even if you don't have as good of a seal and with the ears if you pay the extra 50 bucks they've got a personal EQ configurator that will kind
of play test sounds and then try to create a curve that will match your hearing and actually Gary from the lab said that it worked quite well for him they had to really chop out a lot of the high end he's getting kind of up there  so he's right here I wouldn't say that about him except right to his face oh but first we should probably listen to this message from our sponsor and it's dbrand all I've been told is that it's something to do with nothing's ear earphones imagine if they use the
resources that they dedicate to pranking me for something constructive Maybe they could build a clear phone case that doesn't have problems oh my God how many boxes do I need to open another box yo lonus we heard you like unbox so we put an unbox in your unbox so you can unbox while you unbox you know I don't think it says anywhere in my contract that I have to play along with these jerk   we don't make anything for this device go to short.com to see what they do make
H YouTube music here we go is this loged in his Jake can I mess with him well he seems like probably a Coco melon Enthusiast I mean crazy frog for sure definitely Nicki Minaj Leonard Cohen you know what sure done be like who are you oh wait welcome lius oh no whose account am I in no all right well I guess we're we're going to we're going to be listening to some stuff then wow Live From The Ed Sullivan Show do you remember this performance can't hear a word you're saying got thec on one moment please did
you find at any point that it felt like there might be too much stereo Separation on these things good gravy it sounds like half of the singers are way over there and half of them are over there I mean most people wouldn't complain about a wide Sound Stage let's find something a little more modern though just so I can have some idea what the clarity is like I definitely see what you mean about the base heaviness though it's a lot it's kind of beatsy decent Clarity especially compared to
some of the early beat stuff but it's a little much I got to say even in the non andc mode these don't have pass through  they that's a big missing point cuz even though I can kind of hear through them they still isolate really well and if I wanted to be able to have any situational awareness while I'm wearing my earphones this would be a knock against them oh no I have transparency on right now I couldn't even tell this is cool they have adaptive noise cancellation though so it can detect if
you're in a really heavy environment like on an airplane or a lighter environment like a coffee shop for example and amp it up or down yeah that transparency man is uh I'd want to be able to turn the base enhancement off entirely but they sound really good obviously it's been a couple of years and the industry's made a lot of progress on on active noise cancellation but that that pressure sound that you used to get with the older implementations I get none of that on these what's the general consensus on
the nothing ear headphones hilarious the nothing ear one headphones were released in July 2021 they got a ton of attention for their unique design and features that is what I'm talking about your own assistant on your own headphones has no idea what product I'm asking about because your naming scheme makes no sense nothing okay they're also super base heavy this seems like even more maybe I haven't adjusted the EQ yet base enhance oh God it's already at level one yeah that
doesn't seem to do anything does it it's a shame because like her vocals sound great if they weren't being overpowered if you weren't Side by siding them though honestly I think you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the sound signature of these two headphones so unless you're really into the wireless charging the additional battery life the better IP rating of the case and and the more comprehensive tuning controls man the ear A's kind of looking killer subscribe to Short Circuit
