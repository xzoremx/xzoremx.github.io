so much to unpack it's OnePlus Nord that's their value brand buds 3 Pro there's no non-pro so why are they called Pro is it because they have active noise cancelling in the truly Wireless earbud world does the word Pro simply mean active noise cancelling and if so do we have apple to blame for that I don't know if my hands are really greasy right now but I am streaking up everything this is kind of cool it's got a sparkly look to me that means recycled plastic I don't hate that at all more on
that later what else is in here oh it's like a clam shell it's me is this their logo what is this guy who is he the labs did open this package up before these silicone ear tips were in a little packet and a charging cable with OnePlus red it's a to c and it's really short this is as about as short as they come on the bottom of the case we have a pairing button and a USBC port and then you can see the lid is mat it's not speckled this is brand new plastic baby decent feel pretty small case and
the buds themselves stem design oh but they're tapered they're kind of chungus on the ends that's different it's glossy near the ear and then the stem is more of a soft touch there are three microphones on each earbud there's also you can see the kind of pogo pins for the charging that's where they make contact with the case oh you can definitely screw up which one goes where and when I plugged them in I had charging light on the front oh it's yellow actually there are three microphones on
each earbud there's one of the bottom here there's one at the top of the stem and then there's one right by the driver there and interestingly there's also an indicator for this being the right earbud and that is a hole probably a vent for the drivers they come in two colorways black or Jade it's kind of green I think the design language overall for some reason is giving Smurfs to me they're just kind of bulbous they don't go very deep in my ears which could be related to an issue that
I'll tell you about a little bit later as far as the feeling of them being you know on my body and not going to fall out they feel secure they're IP 55 rated so that's pretty good on the dust support um lots of your phones just don't even certify the Engish protection for dust and debris five is the second highest you can get for that and then for the water protection a lot of earbuds just have four which is splashes these have a five which I believe is jet sprays from all angles um the next level
up would be submersion they're not ready for that the buds themselves nine 38 for the case 50 for the total on the nose that's wow it's like they plan that trying the large tip it actually doesn't feel like it's sealed any better than the medium I think the problem here is how how far in they go not how girthy or narrow the tip I chose was the app does have a fit test that we will do later first I want to see how they sound and how they tested from the lab but we'll do that after

basy I usually don't turn your phones up to the max while I'm doing these videos cuz it's usually unbearable um this is not unbearable that doesn't mean that they don't go super loud it could just mean that they don't get super harsh and uncomfortable at loud volumes I mean they're definitely loud enough you're going to be able to drown out the crappy music at the gym with your own crappier music of course at the volumes they're going to leak sound a little bit too for the people around you now let's check
out how they measured you can see that the frequency response is kind of v-shaped there's a big bump in the base and an even bigger bump in the Trello but one thing to note though is when we plugged these into the ears of our mannequin head that tests earphones and then we ran the app fit test we could only get a fit of average not a good fit we got good fits on our own years but not for the mannequin head and so that kind of shakes our confidence and our test results a little bit if if it had a
better seal it may have had an even bigger bump in the base over here around 60 HZ which would make it even more v-shaped and maybe even more base below 40 HZ we don't know this for sure that's just a charal interpretation of what maybe could have happened the app does offer three different EQ presets the default is balanced but you also can increase the base that's the red line on the screen here or you can turn on serenade which is weird because it lowers the Bas but keeps the treble the
same you might think that's getting it towards being more natural because on the balance profile the Bas is overcooked however since it just makes the graph more and more skewed it might actually sound less balanced to you so summing up the sound profile you're going to hear base kicks are going to be really prominent vocals are really forward the mids are kind of depressed a lot of people will like these but if you're after a neutral sound these are just not very neutral control out of the
box let's take a look at the controls and the app you can adjust the controls independently on both left and right by default single tap does nothing which is actually not uncommon because it helps reduce in inverted Taps double tap is for the next song triple tap is for the previous song and long touch press and hold does nothing and by default they are completely symmetrical so I guess for plain pause they just want you to take it out of the ear that's kind of crazy I'm going to turn that on to oh
play and pause it's the only option they give you for single tap when you hit it you do get a tone like me options for double tap way more okay you can also make that play and pause previous or next you can do the voice assistant or game mode interestingly you can't make triple tap play and pause they just think that's preposterous and here's the volume controls long touch can go volume up or volume down I would put down on the left and up on the right let's see how well that works oh wow that takes
forever to engage and then the steps are pretty slow too when you hit it it actually gives you like a 32 one go kind of sound in your ear it goes beep beep boop now it is adjusting that is so weird it's like it has to unlock before it's going to start adjusting the volume it just takes so long I would I would never use that imagine someone comes up to talk to you and you're like hold on a second let me just turn this down hold on this s is still pretty loud okay now I'm ready like all noise canceling
earbuds these days they have the transparency mode off and active noise cancelling but these ones actually have different levels of noise cancellation mild moderate and Max and we did some measurements but just with Max it's not the strongest active noise cancelling we've ever measured but again we had that seal issue and that could be at play in particular you can see around 40 60 htz range that it's really not doing very much compared to just having your earbud in with the active noise
cancelling off just treating them kind of like earplugs that's what what the green line is you can see that the red active noise counceling line is actually higher than the passive green line from "around 1,000 to 2500 htz meaning that" the active noise cancelling actually blocks out less sound than just having them in your ears in this range and this is something we've seen before we're not sure what the mechanism is there but it's not unique to these buds OnePlus advertises up to 49 DB of active noise
cancellation we don't know at what frequency that claim is from we only got you know not even 30 um again grain of salt because we didn't have a great seal in the mannequin I'm calling it that now let's do a mic test now the phone has been taken away so you know the sound's coming through the earbuds you can see rolloffs at the very high end and then also around 100 Hertz or 200 HZ and that that is actually normal you want the base to roll off a bit so that the people on your call don't hear all the
Rumblings around you the reason that it rolls off at the high end is actually just because of the way the Bluetooth works but this is how the mic sounds I've just done a fit test and I found out using the medium siiz tips I only get an average seal on both years but if I wear the bigger ones I get an average seal in this year and a good seal in this year cuz my head ain't symmetrical in terms of battery life little bit crazy 5 and 1/2 hours on the buds and 20 hours including the charging case if the
ANC is on which normally I would would say I'm going to have that on all the time however since thec doesn't really do that much and in light of what I'm about to tell you I might just have it off when thec is off the battery life like more than doubles to 12 hours on the buds and 44 hours with with the charge case and the buds that is a crazy proportion usually it doesn't get that much better jeez and if you charge him for 10 minutes you get 11 hours of playback again with NOC that's a
that's just silly let's talk price for $80 us honestly I think I'd rather buy the cmf buds instead they're cheaper they come in more fun colors they got that cool dial on the case which I don't care about but just overall they sounded better uh there's I don't see a reason to buy these instead of those sorry OnePlus that might hurt a little but if you can't get the cmf buds these are okay I just I think you can do better they're okay I don't love the seal I don't love the look they're kind of just
they're kind of meh but they're only 80 bucks they don't feel very Pro yes they have a ANC kind of I'm going to just call these the Nord buds 3 come at me OnePlus thanks for watching guys if you haven't seen our cmf buds video go check that out save your money
