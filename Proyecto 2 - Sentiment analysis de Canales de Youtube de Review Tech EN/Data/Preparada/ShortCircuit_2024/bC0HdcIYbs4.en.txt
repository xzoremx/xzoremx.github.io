I love tiny computers and I love all of the cool premium innovations that are being done in the space which is why I'm excited to look at the sh Thor Zone Nano q r and s a really cool small form factor option that has been had a lot of hype around it lately and oh look at the color on this and also interesting packaging this is a there's like no cardboard I guess there's cardboard inside the case but other than that it's just fo and the outside of it I love this color already this is sick
it comes in three colors it comes in a graphite which is what I imagine this to be silver and black white black and black some of the front pieces appear to have fallen off in shipping is that supposed to be like what happened is that supposed to be glue did this come out oh it Brokey okay A bit of a rough start on top of the hype for this case there's also been a little bit of controversy about QC issues Thor Zone they're a really new case manufacturer they've only been in the game for like 5
years I think they had a Kickstarter a couple years back that was successful uh they released and got the case to a lot of people but obviously it was not without troubles um like any sort of Kickstart operation scaling up is always difficult but they're back again and it well it seems like they still need to work on their QC because uh that's tough but we can talk about that this is actually a feature they have swappable things what front pieces when they don't fall off these are supposed to be
replaceable with like a walnut or a carbon one I think the Walnut looks pretty sick it reminds me of like the fractal North or the Terra this is their bigger case this is the r I do want to take a quick peek at their smaller case and also see if we got a different color so this is what the silver looks like it's funny that the packaging didn't match the color cuz this one the packaging matches that one they said nah too too tired too hard the color is very uh Mac it Johnny IV would be proud the
outside frame on this is anodized aluminum and the inside is steel mostly it's kind of like a frame with a really nice shroud that goes over the outside of it and I'll show you what I mean in just a bit so the two sizes the S and the r are 11 L and 16 L respectively and both are fairly compatible with a lot of different Hardware the r supports up to four slot gpus whereas it's just three slot gpus on the smaller one and there's a slight bit of difference in height for
CPU coolers um but this being kind of an AO focused case at least that's how I see it you're not going to have too many problems with compatibility because of our part selection we're going to go with the big case also I think the color is better this doesn't come with instructions there is a QR code on the box that has a link to the instructions I printed them off for my convenience and I forgot to double-side it so I feel bad about the environment to unlock it we just move these and then look what's in

far this is an acitech pump uh it's their gen 7 pump acitech you might not know of them but they actually make like most of the aios for other companies um you can see that this one's really small so like what a lot of companies do is that they get this AIO they swap out like the cold plate they swap out the housing and then bada bing bada boom you have a different AIO with your own brand name on it this is a very basic AIO this just has a header for your pump you'll have to plug your fans into different
headers this also doesn't included with the case it is an optional add-on for €110 which is basically $110 but I'm not doing the math editor will do it right here tip put a soft cloth underneath to avoid scratches like an LTT store desk pad oh look at that so in our accessories bin we have screws handles and the light rays which are just RGB strips these are both options as well you don't have to purchase them but uh the handles apparently they're kind of neat so I'm looking forward to those and then wow
the screws are like in a foam housing look at that that's bougie for all of the fancy stuff they give you they don't give you the hex key to unscrew some stuff so thankfully it's a relatively common hex size in H2 so you'll likely have one in Your Arsenal but if you don't a key would have been really nice oh cool some magnetic uh mesh fan filters for all of the sides what am I supposed to do there's a spot to the top for a 120 or 140 mm fan and other than that I believe that all the fans have to
be attached to a radiator or like your GPU or something to accommodate more configurations of Hardware say you have a taller CPU Cooler or a smaller GPU and you want to get it closer to the side for some reason you can adjust the spine it's just a matter of loosening this thumb screw down here and then once you get the sixth screw out it looks like yeah it just kind of slides over there shifting spines is something we've seen a few times in cases the fractal Tera is probably the most popular example of a
case that has a shifting spine and it's honestly a great feature that allows for way more compatibility because now as I said you can put a pump here you can put a bigger power supply you can have a smaller GPU or you can get a really big GPU and compromise on the CPU cooling it's awesome we're going to keep it with the at the we got to have three slots so I think we are actually keeping it over this way but we're like slightly taller than three slots as you can see so if
we're at that position we don't it no worky this is the colorful iame 490 that you may have seen in the all screen PC on LTT it's a beefer triple and a half slot which means four slot cuz you can't have half a slot it's it's it's tough to fit into much so we're going to go with the largest configuration and I guess I'll put all those screws back in after taking them out we do put our LED strips in right now according to the instructions and those go on these little spines you can see if we look at
the layout of the case motherboard around here power supply around here here's where our radiator is going to go and and it's going to be an intake that's going to be blowing air to both of our to both halves of our system and so you can see that this side has all of these little mounting points for radiators and our fans and this side is solid because of RGB baby let's go I know this is like a premium case but it is funny to me that they are like yeah we're going to have tooling to put
screws in here so that you can exclusively screw these into here that's like what this is for why didn't they just save money and give me some sticky boys so the light rays are an additional €30 which is kind of a crazy price point considering that these are not even diffuse light strips I guess the plus side is that they do work with signal RGB the motherboard all right we're getting somewhere now in addition to our 490 we're going to be putting in a AMD ryzen 979 50x so uh
pretty beefed up system not going to lie but I mean that's like what this is for you're not going to be buying this case if uh you ain't putting some real beef in it you know nonf Ferris screws these aren't magnetic come on how much did I  unbelievable now we're making progress it really they really did put it down to the wire if you look there is like this goes like exactly to the width of this I think you might even lose some compatibility if you put the LED strips in because if you had one of those Rog
motherboards that has like the SS D Mount like up here you might bump into this like even this the the the plug for the LED is actually like interfering with my ability to plug this in a little bit the following steps are only necessary when using extremely long gpus so you can actually unscrew these screws at the Four Corners and you can take the whole front of the case off if you have a very very long GPU that you need to get in there all right power supply time The Cooler Master V100 it's an 1100 wat
sfx power supply that kind of cheats the sfx spec by having a these little things sticking out but it's still crazy that they fit that much power into such a small small little guy it would be nice if they had like the other components printed in the instructions so you kind of had a little bit easier time you know orienting yourself but they don't I find this this level of GPU seg uh very concerning um and there's no screws or anything to mount it into the actual back panel like you can see we're just
kind of hovering here all the support it's a lot of stress on the pcie slot so I'm going to just like kind of tie it in while I'm working with it and then uh hopefully that'll prevent that cuz once the side panels in it's not going to Psy too much there I'm really like wondering if I missed something so I thought that this like power supply was going to be kind of like mounted like on these two top bars here but what it's actually going to be doing is just hanging from these little bars as they insert from
here and then it will screw in through the back side and then this will just be like attached there a little bit weird again again a little bit less stable than I would kind of want especially for a case that comes with a handle which means like maybe you'll be moving it around but again once we get all the cables and maybe things will kind of hold themselves into place though I don't usually want to just rely on the rest of my Hardware to hold my Hardware in place one thing I do like is that you
can see on the mount right here is that we do have again uh an adjustable height for increased compatibility that's something like everything in this case seems to have that we like just don't have enough to get this power supply and this orientation that's cuz I screwed it it upside down like a dumb wait if I go the other way if I screw it in like this it plugs the wrong way around and I don't have quite enough slack to get there oh no I do a lot of times people are worried about like hot
air going into their power supply that's not really something you should be worried about power supplies are raided to withstand a lot of heat in your case and in this case it's actually going to be helping us by encouraging our flow through cooler and exhausting stuff out the back so this is actually a good way of orienting this and you don't have to worry about it it's not like it's going to get choked out because we have a flow through cooler if this was a solid back
GPU I would flip it around the other way to make sure that you're getting enough air to your power supply but in this case it's going to it's going to have no issues with air flow that's going to that's that clears it that clears it but we're going it's funny that there wasn't that much Cable Management to be done because there's not that many cables there's no front I/O really there's just the power button and the RGB ends right by your motherboard so this Cable's really easy to just install though it is
kind of a it's a little too short to be like conveniently routed the acch AIO didn't come with any fans luckily I got these really cool metal Phantom Alpha cool that we saw at CES like last year and um I was planning on using just one of them for the top depending on the color so they're they're not going to be matching but we're going to use them yeah they come in matte black they have a ched out version um and then this one I think is gold and they also have a white version
the gold though look at that luckily we have some 280 fans from the rad that I was going to use and uh we'll toss those on because these uh they're 120s we've got our fans on our radiator now and we're about to put stuff in and now I am seeing that this isn't as spacious as I once thought first off this cable is kind of getting in the way in a big way it's kind of crossing over where we want our radiator to go it looks like you're able to pop this out and flipped around
boot I do not have the strength to do so it's got these weird Clips in it another thing to worry about is all these cables coming from your power supply because uh they could get jammed into your fans so I think we're going to be okay it's just going to be a little bit less than pretty after finagling with the screwdriver we were able to pop this out we're going to turn it so that it goes 90° the other direction and then we're going to pop it back in let's just get this screwed in and then we'll deal with
the cable routing now we just got to get our two radiator fans plugged in and then we are good to go I need a y splitter yeah the last thing that's going in is our fan and I need to make sure which screws we use the long screws for these fans all righty and now these screws are going to be nicely hidden by our little posts that Andy nicely fixed for us by putting the magnets back in we just about done filler right on up important thing to note we put a 120 fan at the top this also supports a 140 mm fans at
top so if you have a bigger fan go for it Moment of Truth to see if it posts or stays on the power supply has no switch so the other issue the other thing might be that my uh front panel connector is plugged in incorrectly they're going now this is looking great and I just missed the chance to go into the BIOS and also don't have a keyboard now we're going to try and get this thing on what is happening why is this been disconnect oh my gosh oh no look at what happened to
the magnetic dust filter look at this oh oh gosh oh wow look at this look at that you got to be really careful that's their rated height that's default so here's something you should be really careful about is that this pcie cable if you have it extend all the way over this pole it can get caught it looks like they don't actually show anywhere in the actual PCI installation instructions that you shouldn't run it there but in an earlier picture they have the cable run in between the motherboard on the other
side of this pillar but like it's still going to be the motherboard is still the the furthest extension and I guess we need to adjust we can't adjust the spine so this goes here it plugs into there but there's no depiction of that it actually has to go behind this little post which if you've already had your motherboard mounted like they ask you to in the manual you might not be able to squeeze it like I can't get this because of this m.2 slot on the back of the motherboard I'm not going to be able to
get this in around there so I'd have to like remember to have that routed ahead of time what happened what is going on here look at what the okay you have to be really really careful about uh your cables and stuff inside because it's a really tight fit there's not a lot of wiggle room between the outer walls of the case I was like I slid it in there and now it looks pretty freaking sick not going to lie that I'm now really excited about this again uh now this case actually supports a couple
different orientations you can put the feet of the case on in multiple spots oh we also have to install the handles so yeah the case feet are included with the rest of the screws and stuff and these are just like little stick on ones they go into these little holes so you can Orient your case anywhere where you have these holes the locks are disengaged it's just that I think there's just so much pressure from the cables Andy can you put like a hand here there we go you just need to make
sure that your cables are really tucked away cuz it we we didn't have this much trouble getting it out before the cables were in here we go so now what I was trying to say was that if we want to get the handles in we have to take out these bottom posts and I don't want to do that cuz boy am I tired then you get the handles at the back like this it's kind of a weird spot for Handles in terms of carrying the case but it does allow you to mount it vertically without having your cables be
totally blocked off right so you'll be able to have a nice case that's taller but takes up less desk footprint it's not perfect there's some issues with like overall refinement like especially on this middle piece I mean and you also saw that the front things fell off but the finish on this middle piece is kind of rough the GPU mount's really sketchy ended you having to use cable ties and stuff like that so I would love to see like a proper bracket integrated into this system and the final kind of big
issue is the price this thing ain't  364 which is a lot of money and the smaller cousin the S is €320 but you can also get both of these cases as open frame cases basically without the outer shell for €249 for the small one and € 274 for the big one so you're kind of paying like 90 bucks just for this outside shell um which I mean listen cutting big pieces of metal is very expensive and I think in terms of Aesthetics they have knocked it out of the park in terms of Parts compatibility they've done a great
job uh in terms of the build experience uh I'm impressed by the manual especially for a small company there's air flow on every side of the case there's room for lots of Radiators and our other coolers so if you're like kind of looking for something in the space that has a similar amount of Hardware compatibility but probably isn't as premium of price for the big guy I would say look at something like the subd mesh Licious that's a great case that's about the same size it's only $160 compared to
like the 360 that this is and if you're looking at something comparable to this in terms of volume look at the form dt1 if you can get it oh look at this blue I know right it's so nice we're just running cinch and combuster at the same time we're not having any problems like obviously our CPU is running really fast after toying around with like fans and stuff I kind of realized there's a bit of an issue is that this is the right side up orientation based on the nanoq logo which means our feet should be
going under here so that we can display it properly but the feet that are included they don't provide much clearance and that is where our radiator fan is what I think would be worthwhile would be actually having this flipped upside down this is the bottom so that your radiators can exhaust out the top top and everything can kind of breathe a little bit better unless you're on a hard surface this is really going to choke your intake even on a hard surface that's not a lot of clearance quick
little pickup turns out that they actually are fixing a lot of the problems that I had with it in the production version they're fixing the GPU Mount apparently they're adding another screw to the back hopefully they add a little bit more cuz I still worry about sag even with their solution they also include a hex key in the box now thank you it was annoying to have to get my own the front little logo is now flippable so it works in both orientation of the case whether you have
the rat up or down and they're fixing the uh magnets so that they don't uh like fall off but they haven't fixed the pcie cable which I'm still a little worried about so who knows overall thoughts I just think this is a really cool case it's really expensive but it is very premium there is a little bit of controversy about QC from their previous case and it looks like they're still kind of working on those considering that they sent us one that kind of broke on the top as well as some weird finish
issues um despite the fact that they're  but gosh is it not just beautiful I mean look at it do you know what else is beautiful people who subscribe to Short Circuit so why don't you click that button down there and then you can watch more awesome content uh and if you got time right now why don't you check out my unboxing of the fractal Tera it's a pretty cool case I own it myself
