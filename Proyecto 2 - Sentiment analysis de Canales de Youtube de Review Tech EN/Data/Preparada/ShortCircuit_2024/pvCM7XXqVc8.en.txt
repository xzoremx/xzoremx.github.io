I've been rocking my pixel watch one for two years since they came out it scratched to heck honestly cuz I just didn't want to have a case on it which honestly kind of makes me less likely to upgrade to this new watch because I don't think anyone's going to buy my old scratched up one and I would have to do something like that because these watches are not repairable at all so if I can't get someone else to use this or buy it it's going in the landfill and I just can't sleep at night with that the
other problem for Google is that the on paper these specs are not that compelling to really get me to upgrade there's a little diagram here of how to take the watch band off of the face there's a little quick start guide I really like this paper packaging it's all recyclable that's cool it doesn't make up for the fact that you can't repair the watch there are two sizes of bands in the box so you get one of that side and then two of this side and then finally the watch itself boom this is the chungus 45 mm
version new to the pixel lineup is sizes it is is great that they have variety I would still be using the small watch but I think they're accessing a lot more people out of the population having this bigger offering because otherwise it just looks too dainty and Tiny on a giant man's wrist this is 40% more screen real estate than the smaller pixel 2 but even the 41 mm has more screen real estate because the bezels are thinner I'm hoping that I can compare the bezels of my one to this
three once we get going here and the final thing in the box is the charging dock which is woo over 3 ft long it has the same design as the pixel 2's charger which is different than the ones annoying that all three watches didn't have the same charger I would love to have an extra charger but even if I buy this watch I'll only have one cuz I won't be able to use my pixel 1's charger let's get this thing paired up to a pixel 9 okay Fitbit a couple comments one of the most interesting
things actually about this watch and maybe this is uh speaking to how kind of lame this upgrade is but one of the nice things they've actually taken features out of the payal garden from Fitbit most notably the Readiness score on my watch if you want to have your Readiness score which tells you like hey you're ready to hit the weights today or do a big workout because you got a good sleep and you're well recovered versus maybe take it easy today that Readiness score is behind the pay wall of the Fitbit
Premium app for my watch on this one it is not and that is awesome I I think they maybe just felt to compete with other watches they had to do that and they should because you should have access to all of the data that gets collected by the sensors on the watch in my opinion they still have pay wal stuff but it's things that you would expect like classes and AI insights and stuff like that that personally I'm not going to use some other new stuff that is not payal is what's being described here you
can make custom workouts for yourself such as I want to run this long with this level of intensity and then I'm going to slow down and walk slower at this level for this many minutes and you can tailor your own workout which is pretty cool again I'm never doing this I hate running I hate running long distance that's for sure I'm going to Sprint if anything and then I just go by how much sweat I have and I don't need to watch to tell me I'm out of breath that's what I'm talking about enhanced
recovery by tracking sleep and stress couple of safety features being touted here the one that I think is the most notable is safety check where you go okay my daughter's going out for a 25 minute run uh so it sets a timer and when that timer expires then her live location is shared so like hey she supposed to be back now by now where is she I can check that out that's that's pretty cool by the way that's not just for parents you can choose which of your contacts you want to share that live
location with could be for your partner or your roommate whoever as far as watch specific apps you've got the camera and Spotify already installed and then for recommendations number one SoundCloud baby SoundCloud check out my band who's using SoundCloud what particular order are these coming in at if it really is random then These Guys these more obscure kind of apps are definitely winning all right the watch is starting up and this sweater is beautiful but way too hot for right now and so oh my God
we need to talk to our sponsor GMA K who is featuring their tk75 Pro mechanical keyboard it has all the features you'd expect like a hot swapable PCB multiple layers of foam try mode connectivity and self-facing RGB and that's not all it's even got a volume control knob high quality ktt hin linear switches and a full aluminum chassis to help this board stand out from the crowd the best part it's under $100 check it out using our Link in the video description if you buy the 41 mm
today it'll still be 10% bigger in screen size than the pixel 2 because of Slimmer bezels but they love to hide these bezels with a black screen don't they another big thing is screen "brightness double the brightness 2,000" nits Peak on the new watch compared to the pixel 2 which is going to be great when you're outside on a sunny day if you live in a place that actually ever gets Sun yeah I can see that this is a pixel one but that is a lot brighter even this watch will light up a dark room so combined
with it being bigger that is going to be a lot brighter that's how thick the bezels are they really don't look that much thinner than pixel ones even so I guess that's 10% because it's a circle and it's on the Outer Rim but it doesn't look materially bigger for Ingress Protection this is ip68 rated up to 50 m that's five atmospheres deep that is really deep you guys that is beyond the base basic diving certification you need Advanced diving certifications to go that deep 50 50 m is deep so that is
really impressive they say you can swim in the ocean with this thing salt water whatever wear it in the shower you're good to go you don't have to think about it and that is what I expect from basically any smart watch I don't there's no way I'm taking my watch off to go in the shower tell you that puppy has the same chip as in the pixel Watch 2 no new s so or anything there it's Snappy enough you're not mining you're not crypto mining on this thing thing but there are some cool new features
including maybe an underrated one called morning briefing it basically just it knows the first time you look at your watch in the morning and it just gives you some key stats like this is how well you slept this is what the weather's like today and this is what's on your calendar pretty cool you can't really tailor what comes in that morning briefing but it does try to act with some intelligence and give you you know novel information in terms of controls you can control your phone's camera from
the watch which is useful but not new you can control your Google TV it's basically your remote you can control the volume next episode all that stuff from here which is very cool especially if you lose your remote a lot which I do my couch just has so many cracks between the cushions it could be anywhere and you can use this as like a viewfinder for your nest camera so somebody Rings your doorbell you're washing the dishes your hands are all soapy you just look at your watch and you can you can not
only see them you can even talk to them although I will say that I hate using this thing on speaker phone and talking through it it's very quiet and um sounds bad you're on my wrist and you know what this thing doesn't look outlandishly large on my wrist like Apple watch Ultra does I could honestly rock that I'm talking to you with my hands on steering wheel kind of position so the watch face is not oriented toward my mouth anymore how does that sound it sounds pretty good sounds like you're just on speaker
phone on a regular phone I'm speaking at a volume that is normal for me maybe abnormal for some I'm not really quite sure you never can be sure can you all right I think it's loud enough I'm going to hang up on you now yeah it's like a little fuzzy uh you sound further away You're a bit quieter you sound like dog poop man you were like a really compressed little man at in the bottom of a can yeah I don't know if this is a pixel one is they're all like this or if mine got smashed but this is junk the
battery life claim is the same as for L year which is 24 hours with the always on display on it does kind of suck to have to charge your watch every day that said charging is 20% faster this time around and the charging speed is such that it's it's kind of solved you basically never really have to charge this for longer than a half hour if you get the smaller size the larger watch has a larger battery and you know you might want to charge it for about 45 to 50 minutes to get 80% of the battery but
if you don't run it down to zero cuz you're charging it every day you only really have to plug these things in for about a half hour 45 minutes that's basically your morning routine go have a take it off when you go have a shower you know what take it off brush your teeth you come back it's already charged really not a nuisance I personally am a morning charger person because I like to wear it at night and get that sleep tracking info should you buy one or should you upgrade pricing 350 bucks for
the smaller one an additional 50 bucks for the big one if you want LTE to have a SIM card in this puppy then it's an additional $100 on either model against competitors in the market the Apple watch starts at 50 bucks more than where the pixel watch 3 starts and the Samsung Galaxy series they start at 50 bucks less so it's kind of in the middle one thing to note though is this is launching at the same price that the pixel 2 launched at last year the pixel Watch 2 is being discounted by 100 bucks
so maybe you should just go get one of those for 250 or if you're a pixel one user like me you can just keep on using it because honestly I don't think the differences are that big maybe you like the new colors that you can see here there's different watch face colors and band colors you do not get to choose which band goes with which face but of course you can buy aftermarket or different colors of bands separately My overall feelings about this product is that it's it's great that Google is you know
pushing the ball forward every year I don't think it's compelling enough to upgrade from even the first iteration I'm glad that we're making these incremental improvements but they are so incremental that there's really no point in unless you make calls from the watch a lot cuz damn that sucked if you guys think I'm wrong and you would upgrade from watch that's even 2 years old let us know in the comments and check out our other watch videos like Li recent coverage of the OnePlus
watch that I think he's still wearing
