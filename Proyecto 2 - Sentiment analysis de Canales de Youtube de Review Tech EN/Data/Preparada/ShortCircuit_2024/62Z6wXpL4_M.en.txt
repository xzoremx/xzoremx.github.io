two years ago James checked out version one of the goie AI sync box well they're back again sponsoring this video for us to check out Gen 2 they make one that's compatible with their TV as well but we're going to check out the PC one we're the AI sync box actually takes your HDMI input from your devices and then has an output to your TV and using that signal it can use its AI calculations to actually project lights onto your wall so you can get a more immersive experience but let's see
what it comes with here paper quick start guide which is more paper oh this is the sync box itself oh wow it's got four HDMI inputs and one out that's actually one more than last year's model and these HDMI inputs are actually 2.1 as well meaning you can go all the way up to 8K 60 which you probably won't do cuz you don't have an 8K TV but that means you can do 4K 144 which is fantastic for gaming and 1440p at 240 it's got everything and then it's also got two outputs here in type c and
that's for connecting the lights that actually come with this kit here the last connector is just the power on the back here and then RGB strip all along because this sits on your desk in front of you while you're gaming and it can do RGB diffusion as well and these are the two goie light bars here they each sit on either side of your monitor with the LEDs facing the wall away from where you're sitting so they can diffuse on the wall here and they connect with your type-c to those ports we talked about
earlier got some nice sleeved HDMI cables for two of them I guess one going in from whatever console or PC and then back to your monitor in this box here we have the RGB icw LED strip which now featur features 75 LEDs per meter instead of 60 it's all rolled up nicely for you with a 3M sticky on the back for you to be able to stick it to your monitor 15 more LEDs might not sound like a lot but it really does help with more color contrast and more variety in your color diffusion oh these are the
stands I thought this was actually just the goie logo itself there's one power cable there that's the barrel end Jack comes with a little screwdriver what are we screwing 3M sticky pads this is for the light strips for sticking behind your monitor on your TV your TV cabinet whatever that's a very big bag for six screws these towers are also RGB icw meaning they added a white LED over last year which helps with brightness color accuracy diffusion again overall these RGB lights are better than last year's
we're going to go install our RGB strip on the back of our monitor really quick where did I put the me clips oh there they are looks like we have some clips left over from our last video that might make this very easy to mount then installation's overall pretty easy you just need to peel the 3M off this but you want to also make sure you use the included alcohol pads to wipe down wherever you're going to be sticking it in our case around the clip area along the sides here they have actually short
sides on the LED which go on the short side of your monitor and then the long side so it actually is kind of hard to mess it up this Kit's compatible with the 27 to 34in gaming monitors and then the TV one ranges from 55 all the way up to 85 depending on which kit you buy using some of the clips to hold the corners down just so they're out of the way but it was pretty quick install overall we unfortunately have this open cap in R monitor which caused it to kind of do this W motion it still sticks very
well it's going to be totally fine once we actually get the LEDs on have to swap out our display port cable for the included HDMI ones this one goes from our GPU into the Inn on the goie box which again this features four HDMI ins so you could use it as an HDMI switcher which is pretty cool it's not even advertised for that but hey why not the USB from the strips here going into this output and then the HDMI from the monitor is going into the HDMI output and then our towers are already
plugged in as well are they labeled left and right they're labeled G for go wherever the hell you want a there we go okay so the two buttons on the side here this back one is for power this one is the toggle between the four HDMI ports and when you're toggling each section kind of lights up to let you know which one you're in so 1 2 3 or four took a little bit to figure that out but we're here with our computer connected let's see if we can actually test the colors here oh wow without even fully setting
up the yet you can see the light Trail going all the way down it's pretty cool I think later in this video there's color wheel too W that's not the coolest feature though it boasts a feature called cogn glow as well which is an AI tool that can read whatever game you're playing and give you led effects based on what you're doing which we're going to check out but an example is if you're healing an apex it actually like charges your health bar it's pretty cool let's go let's play a game so just walking
around the map you can see changes based on whatever object we have so we have kind of a more yellowy Brown object and the light even changes going out to the daylight it's pretty cool but let's test like a flashbang let's see if it just blinds us here I definitely turned that one to bright white we haven't even adjusted the settings in the app yet so I don't know if this is Max brightness or not but maybe on Max brightness it'll actually like flashbang you which would
be kind of funny it does give a feeling like you're entering indoors just because it's so bright from the outside and then as you walk in everything kind of just dims around you and the good news is if you already have some lights set up you could actually pair it with this box already using their AI dream view which allows you to maybe sync all of them together increasing your Ambience the environment around you as you walk in it all dims or flashbang yourself we didn't pair this led just
because we wanted to test the kit that it comes with and it's already pretty good even on this blue wall which is probably like the worst case scenario so our brightness was actually at 100% which is fine but you can also adjust relative brightness so you could just have the bars go brighter than the backlight or vice versa but there's a saturation slide here I'm going to crank that up to 100% is it different okay in in person it's very subtle oh wow that's way more noticeable
when it's already very dark and then you flashbang that's pretty cool I could imagine like having a full room of this it' be pretty funny if somehow like you're playing a game and actually just go blind there's one effect I think in League where you get like a double kill and then a triple kill and even a Penta kill the lights will change I'm not that good to test that one but it's those kind of features that the AI box really shines through for in-game events to help increase your immersion some other
Mis stuff it's compatible with smart home features with matter support vrr as well as autol low latency mode and overall I think it does really help to the immersion of whatever you're either watching or you're playing for $280 the PC kit including the two lamps the LED strips the 4-in-1 HDMI box which doubles as an HDMI splitter it's a pretty compelling offer to help increase your immersion in your game or your movies and the TV kit actually starts at 240 so if you just want to increase your movie
watching or your couch console games I think it's kind of a fine offer to have and it looks sleek too but let us know what you guys think down below thanks again for sponsoring this video maybe go check out the first version that James did almost two years ago so that way you can see some of the differences
