do you have a PlayStation 5 professional yet what you do we're late well whatever we're checking out the PS5 Pro and I am actually pretty excited about this thing I know that a lot of the coverage of the PS5 pro has been focused on the 200 plus dollar price hike but there's actually a lot of value in here that I don't know if Sony is getting quite enough credit for for starters there's the GPU upgrade the new GPU has 67% more compute units for an estimated 45% better Real World
performance in games okay most people probably won't notice the difference but there's more we lose the disc drive which is actually a gigantic bummer but what we gain is a 2 tbte rather than 1 tbte SSD and it wasn't even a full terabyte on the original console and we get another 2 gigs of ddr5 memory that is dedicated to the CPU giving us the enre 16 gigs of gddr6 memory for the GPU once again I have sequestered myself not looking at other coverage in order to bring you guys the freshest Impressions
and I feel like my wife I thought it was going to be bigger they really Managed IT they made the PS5 shape after all this time not look completely stupid I think it looks kind of cool do people think it looks cool oh boy I don't have the vertical stand on yes I understand that the vertical stand cost what what is it 30 bucks or something like that which is really 30 bucks yeah I think this could have been included but here's an option don't buy it it's fine who cares what it's not going to fall over
it's fine it's fine I'm going to go on bamboo handy right now and there's nothing but there is a PlayStation 5 slim vertical stand so whether you use a mail order printing service or you just find a friend that has a 3D printer or local maker space I believe in you I think you can figure it out let's talk about the key benefits here Sony I think has actually done a pretty good job of not overselling what the PS5 Pro is it uses a combination of a more powerful GPU a little bit more system memory and
probably most importantly their new spectral super resolution which seems like a kind of in between amd's own FSR which is their upscaling technique and/ sharpening technique and nvidia's deep learning super sampling which is an AI driven upscaling technique so Sony's is AI driven but doesn't seem to be quite on the level of nvidia's at least if digital foundaries coverage is to be believed which pretty good about that stuff it should be noted though that this is in PS5 Pro enhanced games and in
a lot of titles you can expect more along the lines of just smoother frame rates at the same visual fidelity or in older backwards compatible titles in some cases a little bit of subtle upscaling so far pretty mediocre sales pitch but we haven't touched on their more advanced Ray tracing according to Sony they're using a new generation AMD Ray tracing engine that isn't even present in amd's own dedicated gpus at least not yet which should result in some more impressive lighting effects
all of this can wait for the side by side that we're going to do a little bit later first let's take a closer look at it physically ah yes Kensington lock HDMI 2.1 supporting up to 8K output though I couldn't help noticing that not only did Sony remove the 8K branding from the original PS5 it is also not present on the new PS5 Pro they talk about variable refresh rate they talk about 120 HZ 4K gaming and HDR but no mention of 8K even though technically it will output it and these new upscaling
techniques could actually help with that power input for the what is it 390 W power supply I got to imagine that's overs speec for this thing just based on the size that's a big cooling fan okay maybe she does do 400 wats good gravy look at that cooler it's not that heavy though a couple more USB ports USBC this time with one of them being 10 gig super speed and of course our power button I know I mentioned this already but once again guys there is no disc drive and as we covered recently that is
going to cost you in the longer term but is also probably just the future we're headed towards whether we like it or not oh one other minor gripe even though the size is very similar to the PS5 slim the  a little bit of power to keep the clock accurate once the power plug is yanked so once these button cells die you can get kind of flaky behavior from computers and computers that are shaped like PlayStations upgradable SSD I still cannot get over that Sony didn't go proprietary you know memory stick mini
disc they have such a long Rich history uh memory cards for the original PlayStation good guy Sony well bad guy Sony who did the right thing this time technically Sony sent this and told we're not allowed to tear  won't I mean she probably still works hey let's find out after this message from our sponsor War Thunder thanks War Thunder for sponsoring this video take command of over 2500 highly detailed Vehicles as you unleash a world of pain on your enemies War Thunder makes it easy to drop in and

lights that look like lights that are casting light like look how much more detailed the Shadows are on the stairs oh we should definitely go to Fidelity mode then that'll be a 30 FPS mode wow they somehow uh put even less clothing on Tifa smooth I haven't played this yet that's the original that's me person this is my game you don't buy the outfits you earn them okay that's way better but then that's 30 FPS oh gross oh that's say oh buddy just the ability to never have to play in 30fps mode that
would be a major factor for me one thing I've seen though is people claiming that if you sit far enough back from your TV it doesn't make a difference so let's go back to Performance mode cuz I'm definitely going to notice the FPS difference and then let's move away from it very noticeably softer even from here and these are only 42in displays so this is a very very reasonable distance from them as soon as things are in motion like the lighting the lighting across his six-pack this is a cut scene
and these G these games have really good like cut scene rendering so I'd be interested to see once we're in the battle how it feels he put fire on my body okay I get iling on the the back rail you're in CLE yeah I'm getting Mario and I saw a little bit of flickering on the stairs when we were coming into the Coliseum however I also saw it on that one so it seems to be just like a rendering eror of some sort or maybe a realistic representation of like crappy LED lighting you're not
Marvel Sony they already sold me the game but they can't just let me play it Fidelity Pro still runs at 30 frames per second yeah but I think it's a native 4K okay but here's what I want to see is my performance Pro going to look like your Fidelity uh I did performance the fact that we're looking this closely tells you pretty much everything you need to know let's go back to gaming distance I mean like if I'm buying a PlayStation today anyway and I just you know I'm like H I don't know whatever I
have A200 extra dollars burning a hole in my pocket sure what whatever buy a pro do you want to see your FPS mode versus my FPS mode you know what this is actually quite playable especially compared to Final Fantasy rebirth yeah like this is fine this is probably somewhere between 45ish FPS wait wait wait I think it's lock 30 it looks better than 30 that's she she's like feel it too like she feels responsive there's no way that's 30 FPS it's just not I I might be wrong I'm so console branded now and the
difference between 30 and 40 is is very very well okay most people don't care but I can I still think it's a little silly to be remastering a game that's this new but I don't mind it too much when it's a $10 upgrade if they made me Reby it yeah I'd be freaking pissed this looks exactly the same let's get to the game playay yeah yeah yeah we're going to get to the game play motion blur off  option that's 30 FPS for sure yep oh uh yeah I'm getting a little less  bucks I'm going to go down to balanced
and I'm going to see if it still looks about the same but I'm getting way better fps I mean I guess it depends on how good you are at the combat I spent a lot of time slinking around in the foliage okay David do you want to change yours to favor uh performance you can tell there's a bit too much of an oversharpening filter applied to yours the upscaling is doing some work but I don't know if I'd never seen this we're doing side by side cuz it's fun to play these kinds of games if it wasn't
side by side I could not tell you which one is which and it's nice that there's 55 plus games that are already PS5 Pro patched I expect that the games that are more poorly optimized are going to see the bigger boost whereas all these Sony first party games are all pretty freaking tight on the PS5 that the jump and Fidel wouldn't be worth it which is tough because that's why you buy a PS5 is for the Sony first party stuff yeah so not a bad machine you're getting the extra performance you're getting some
