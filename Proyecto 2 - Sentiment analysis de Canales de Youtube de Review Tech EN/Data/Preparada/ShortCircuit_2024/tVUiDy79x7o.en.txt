I don't know what to make of this the brilliant Labs frame sounds kind of great they're AI glasses with a micro OLED display 40 G weight that's pretty good not to mention claimed all day battery life with their Mr power accessory but I've been bamboozled before and anything with AI on it has a huge huge uphill battle ahead of it to sell me on it so let's unbox this bad boy and see what we can learn about oh step one tutorials step two download the app no step one finish unboxing it then
I'll get to the tutorials we've got a  pieces I feel smarter already oh my God this is the charging cradle okay that might be the cutest thing I have ever seen I want wear it with it how do I look all right first impressions I definitely can't completely see through the micro OLED display there's a bit of a border here where the glass and the other glass interact however it's usable is this a picture of their team or  it okay all right they're a small company they're a small company they
still got to work on those little details like making sure that you're drinking your own Kool-Aid nose piece definitely helps a little bit with me I got to say weight distribution not bad like I could shake these off if I really wanted to but I'd have to really go full Tailor Swift you know and man it really it really like sits on the bone there oh do I want to talk about how it looks I don't know why don't you come talk about how it looks how do I look I'm going to have my hand here just in case I need it 
that's that's it you look very French oh really okay mhm in like a trendy way or in like a we surrendered immediately way uh like you drink 20 espresso oh okay I'll let you take that as you will here's the Pogo pin contacts for the cute little nose piece charger which by the way is USBC you love to see it wow tiny PCB in here you know it's kind of shockingly impressive like I don't look at these and go oh yeah wow they're full of electronics it's hard to hide it because you can see it obviously
but man I mean these frames are no thicker than some trendy frames these days and they've manage to pack a Flippin computer into it the batteries hang out at the end here which gives them a pretty good balance compared to a lot of VR headsets or smart glasses that I've worn in the past and the construction feels pretty cheap um so make of that what you  Sure Stop bending them there's a camera right in the front here which supposedly can be used to ask questions about the
world around you and even tell you how many calories you're about to consume good freaking luck with that and the micro OLED display is designed to give an approximately 20Â° diagonal field of view whatever that means the main features are visual recognition powered by open AI realtime translation either live translation from speech or text although how it plans to do speech translation without speakers is a little confusing if I have to have my phone out anyway it sort of raises the question
why couldn't this be an app AI web search powered by perplexity and image generation an example they give is asking to see what your couch would look like in a different color again I'm sort of confused as to why I wouldn't just use my phone for that especially given that well who knows I don't know I mean it's got a screen on it okay cool am I allowed to use the app now after you talk about our sponsor after I talk about our sponsor net XT their c500 is A500 wat 80 plus Platinum certified unit
and this level of efficiency means less power consumption and a cooler quieter system it's fully modular so that it's easier and cleaner to Cable manage plus it's 180 mm form factor means more k space and better airf flow see why cybernetics gave it their titanium rating and get yours today by clicking the link in the video description here we go tutorials it's always cool when companies put their tutorials on YouTube cuz you can tell how many people bought it oh wow not many going to go over the
process ofing e vertical video so here we go you just got frame in the mail really can tell you can tell X Apple you've got frame in the mail you've got frame you got a frame you got the frame it's not a proper noun stop it Apple started this with the whole iPhone thing it's an iPhone not iPhone bring your device close oh it needs the nose on to pair hey frame found here we go now the site claims all day battery with the Mr power accessory but it's not super clear if Mr power is a battery bank or not
updating software hey there we go that was painless mostly after the world's longest update we're ready to go hi I'm Noah let me show you around tap the side of your frame to wake me up whoa hey there we go oh there's a sweet spot for sure if it's a little bit too high you see upside down here and right side up here if it's an exactly exactly the right spot hey it sounds like you might be talking about adjusting the display settings or lens alignment ooh do you need help with specific  sure tap me
in tap to finish all right all set what would you like me to do next I thought you were going to help me with the display alignment okay there you go you have to tap it twice H it's kind of jarring like tapping your whole glasses make sure to adjust the mounting bracket to level the screen horizontally and ensure the base is secure how would I rotate this display surely that's not a thing right no you used a quarter of my credits what what what' you do to use a quarter of my credits belt
I walk away for what a couple of hours while they get everything set up and he uses a quarter of my credits okay there's some stuff to talk about here it's free but you get a limited number of credits and I think they're working on a paid tier but it doesn't exist yet so for now you just have a limited number of credits that you can use for AI tasks like Voice to Text uh responding to your questions or recognizing objects can you guys even see this at all like hey Noah tell me a joke joke about a
giraffe oh my God it doesn't register the tap like half the time tell me a joke about tell me a joke about a giraffe and a priest who walk into a bar I mean it's just chat GPT right giraffe and a priest walk into a bar the bartender looks up and says what is this  contest I'm laughing but not for the  reasons what am I looking at right now this is quite possibly the least convenient way to do hand in front of a screen displaying abstract digital patterns or Graphics wait why can
nothing recognize the LGT store Northern Lights desk pad we've been through this before with that other piece of AI thing damn it can I drink this no you can't drink that it looks like a small electronic device or remote control how would you describe this snack I'm actually having more success tapping the right side even though the computer parts are all over here it looks like a packaged snack possibly chips biscuits or crackers but I can't determine the exact type from here why not it's Miss
