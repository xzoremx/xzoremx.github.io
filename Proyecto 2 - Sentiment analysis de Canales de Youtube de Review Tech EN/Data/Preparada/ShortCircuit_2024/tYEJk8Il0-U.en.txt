N9 years ago I reached out to Lexar trying to get my hands on this super cool modular card reader Tower dock thing called the workflow hr1 they didn't reply to me so ultimately I bought not one but two of them which we used for years they're super cool you can use the modules either inside the tower which can be either USB or Thunderbolt or separately if you need to take them on the go only one small problem Lexar totally abandoned this product line is what I used to say not
only did Lexar send me the brand new workflow but they actually sponsored this video checking it out and this thing looks absolutely sick now instead of being Thunderbolt 2 or USB 3 it is Thunderbolt 4 instead of having four docks it can support up to six docks plus a couple of USB ports one type a one type c in the front and it even supports daisy chaining up to six of these devices according to the Thunderbolt spec including having displays in line with it and whatever
else it even supports USB power delivery so if you have say for example your MacBook hooked up to it or something like that you can charge your MacBook at up to 140 WS while you use it we'll get to that in a second first I want to take a closer look at this bad boy there's our 140 W charging there's our Thunderbolt port and there's our Thunderbolt daisy chain there's a cooling fan there's a cooling fan intake I guess we've kind of covered it oh no we haven't right not all of the bays at
the front are made equal two of them are 40 gbit per second so that's the maximum speed supported by Thunderbolt 4 and then the other four are 10 gbit per second and the savy among you are probably going to have figured out that you're not going to be able to saturate all six of these bays at exactly the same time the construction is aluminum feels quality especially when you compare it to the plastic construction of the old one and oh I'm curious will the old modules oh nope not even close
uh let's see what else comes in the Box okay professional workflow customize your needs with versatile modular readers and and portable ssds we've got support for dual slot SD UHS 2 a regular SD and a Micro SD UHS 2 uh portable ssds in two and 4 terab flavors as well as support for CF Express 4.0 type A and type B with backwards compatible for CF Express 2.0 we also got a thunderbolt cable they say this is a is this a a gan brick yeah okay 140 W Gan brick and then adapters that I don't need for
international plugs yep that's a short cable Thunderbolt 4 has some issues we've overlooked something haven't we in the Box you might have noticed there isn't a single module yeah just like the old one it's not a a cheap solution the SD card module is going to cost you around 50 bucks the CF Express modules are around 100 bucks and the ssds are $300 and $500 respectively for the different capacities all right and in terms of included accessories they just come with a USB cable and then the little modular
reader itself so just like the old generation one you can use USBC and use it as a standalone device or you can slot it right into our reader here is it Direct agnostic can I just put it in either way I want oh yeah okay cool it seems to not care but all the text goes this way so I'm going to keep it consistent oh this is a 40 GB per second module cool let's put it in that side oh okay I got a 2 tby SSD let's go ahead and throw that in a 40 GB per second module CF Express is so fraking
expensive this CF Express type B card one terabyte is "$1,000 and I don't think Lexar is even" that out of touch with the market reality for this one like it's just these are these are really expensive cards do I wonder why that standard hasn't really taken off Christmas party yeah yeah for sure buddy one last thing they also include a type A to type c adapter in the Box all right I'm going to put my type A in the other 40 GB per second slot there we go do I have a micro SD yeah oh there was one that was
still in box that I could have unboxed all right well there you go that's the unboxing experience man did they send over all of this media for this video dude do they know that I would have done this for not the sponsorship for just like this really expensive media cut that cut that all right got all the Lexar baby dude what you can have 36 card readers on a single port not to mention that some of them are dual like SD and micro SD ones ridiculous okay so some of these have
some stuff on them right hey look at that all footage 472 gabes okay here we go 23 gigs let's go good gravy 2.6 gigabytes that's with a big b gigabytes per second we are moving around 10 of gig files just like they are nothing what kind of speeds are we going to get on our SD cards let's try let's try copying one of these files to our SD card uh let's go with our fullsize SD not bad not bad 20 200 200 and something megabytes a second dude I know for those of you who don't care
this is not going to be that exciting but for those of us who do care being able to move footage around quickly and seamlessly is a huge deal there you go there you go see that the big number is off the graph now so we can actually see the SD card transfer now let's say that we wanted to transport some footage back with us okay so we've got that what was that like a 30 gig file or something like that on our SD card uh it's pretty typical for us to carry something back if the camera operator is traveling
separately or to make two copies so if two people are traveling each of them has has one and using a portable SSD like this is a really good way to do that so I'm just going to rip one of my uh CF Express card readers out I'm going to throw that SSD in there and then I'm going to copy from my SD card to my portable SSD sorry it was 15 gigs 15 gigs she's cooking at around 240 250 megabytes a second which is about what we'd expect for a v90 SD card of course that's not as fast as this SSD can go
but we'll wait until this is done first now let's try pulling off of our our CF Express type B and throwing that onto our SSD man this makes me wish we did shoot on CF Express I don't want to pay for CF Express but boy do I ever like the speeds like yeah just casual 850 megabytes a second no problem we shoot that uh we shoot Tech link on them we shoot TechLink on CF Express why in just speed oh for exactly this reason because Tech linked is edited and uploaded the same day it's shot every second count so
sitting and waiting you know 10 15 20 minutes for inest not really an option especially when you can do it instantly like this all right now let's take one of those files let's take our 23 gig file and copy it off of our SSD onto our desktop okay it looks like this SSD will do anywhere in the neighborhood of around 850 to 900 megabytes a second whether we're reading or writing that's a little shy of what Lexar said we might be able to in the real world but still fast enough that you are able to move footage
around extremely quickly Lexar wanted us to point out that the SSD is ip68 water resistant and comes with a 5-year warranty and the rest of the modules come with three-year warranties and include appropriately rated USBC cables you can't take that for granted anymore so the CF Express ones come with 40 GB per second rated ones and the SD ones come with 10 GB per second rated ones I for one am super happy to see this back I know that this won't be that meaningful to some of you but to me it
is a pretty freaking big deal it might be too much to ask but I'd love to see Lexar expand the lineup I mean it's just Thunderbolt and USB ports so conceivably nothing would prevent someone from you know creating a a third-party USB accessory USB hob or something like that that plugs into it if it's sitting on the desk right next to your computer or uh a carrier sled that allows you to put an m.2 drive in and then just kind of close it up and pop it in there I mean the guy is kind of the limit when it
comes to modular stuff like this just got to see the ecosystem be built out and don't make me wait 9 years for an update it's not cheap but it is something that as you guys can see I mean it wasn't cheap last time if you have the workflow for it it can be worth it even though it's uh what is it $600 for the dock this time around yeah like I said like I said before not cheap but uh definitely cool thanks Lexar for for sponsoring this video and sending over these goodies thank you guys for watching
