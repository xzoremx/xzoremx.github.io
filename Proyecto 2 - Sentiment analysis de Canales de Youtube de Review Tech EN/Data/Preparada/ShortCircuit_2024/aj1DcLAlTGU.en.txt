Dell buddy are you okay your XPS laptops recently have been both incredibly engineered and just the worst things that I have seen in a long time because of decisions that you did not need to make so I'm in the very strange position where I'm going to be recommending this right here this is the new Dell Inspiron 16 plus and it looks to be even better than the XPS 16 because it's not stupid haa up first is our power adapter this thing will deliver 130 wats and that is over USB type-c love to see it plug it
in turn it on Wow here it is this is just a big slab of laptop right here there is so little design going on and I'd like to say that I want a bit more of that but we have seen what happens when Dell goes full in on design you end up with things like no IO fortunately we have that here a Micro SD card slot headphone microphone combo Jack thank you Dell don't remove that from your other laptops USB type A another type A wow they know that exists too we also have Thunderbolt 4 HDMI 2.1 one of the
strangest is that on the igpu version the HDMI is 1.4 which means you can't even do 4K out of it so be very careful when you're looking between the two models because the one with the dgpu and the igpu are completely different this is the power brick that came with this right yep yes why is there a barrel Jack hole over here apparently this might be because people that already have deployments of a whole bunch of these maybe they want to use a barrel Jack with their existing systems I don't know
it's kind of strange you'd expect this to just be like another type c or something like that the first thing that I'm noticing that is a huge upgrade compared to the XPS series is the fact that this is just nice to touch all of the edges are nice and rounded there's nothing sharp what I am sure of is that it feels good what I'm not as sure of is the size of this trackpad on First Look I feel like they could have definitely made it a little bit bigger there are of course
some other things that let you know that "this isn't a $33,000 laptop we don't" have any Gorilla Glass here and the plastic around the bezels not the greatest in the world it probably makes the screen pretty easy to replace but we have a matte display and we also have this Segway to our sponsor motion gry motion Gray's sit desks come in a variety of models sizes with easy to follow instructions and all the tools you need for assembly included right in the Box check out their Ergo 2 Series
some of the most affordable desks of their type on the market with a two segment frame and a quiet but powerful single motor it has a height adjustment range of 28 to 46 in and supports up to 176 lb of weight that's about 80 kg for y'all metric folk pick up one through our Link in the description and use code Linus to save 10% off your purchase 4.8 lb that is quite a bit of heft for a machine like this and when you combine that with the power brick that is 5.8 lb that you're going to have to carry
around in your backpack that's going to be quite a bit to have on your back and you can comment down below about how oh I had a gaming laptop and I was able to I don't care that's quite a bit of way this display is not the greatest that I've ever seen if I'm honest I was expecting it not to be the best ever this is not a top-end laptop and it does not come with OLED or anything crazy like that but when I saw that it was Quad HD 120 HZ 300 nit Peak brightness isn't great but the rest of it sounded
very promising but the let down is that it's just kind of grainy and I don't understand why there's no touchscreen digitizer to get in the way you guys are just going to have to trust me on this one but it's just not what I was expecting when I saw the specs of this display it is still really quite good given the price point it's just not quite where I wanted it to be looking at the labs test results this display does measure quite well we're able to get 326 nits Peak brightness Which is higher
than the 300 that's advertised with a Delta e2000 of 2.29 you would definitely be able to use it to video or photo edit in a pinch even if it isn't something that I would trust if it is my professional job to do stuff like that but it should be noted that you do not want to switch this out of the default color profile that gets you nice srgb everything else is going to just look strange and probably in ways that you don't want one other thing that is a little bit odd about this display is
that you have the options of 120 HZ or 48 HZ o that's some 48 HZ does not feel good 60 you can kind of get away with 120 feels way better all right let's have a look at what's under the hood for the processor we have an Intel core Ultra 7 155h that has 16 cores six performance eight efficiency and two low power efficiency cores and those performance cores will go up to 4.8 GHz making this quite a rapid little guy we also have 16 GB of RAM at 5600 megga transfers per second and it says form factor so DM O
So this might be upgradeable I love to see that we also have a 1 TB mvme SSD Wi-Fi 6 E from Intel like to see that Intel's npu which does not meet the minimum specs for co-pilot even though they did steal a key for co-pilot and also an Nvidia RTX 4060 now this is going to be a little bit of a controversial pick so you can go for the 4060 in this but you only get 60 watts of power out of this chassis which is not going to be getting you the full  you know what I really like this
keyboard it has a very satisfying snap to the key travel and the stability of these Keys is fantastic like look if I push on the corner whole thing going down way before it's getting below the chassis I think I'm going to give this keyboard a solid a and bonus points still for having an actual Escape key in function row and I don't have those stupid Capac what is certainly not going to be getting an a though is the track pad the size I can get over it's made out of myar instead of
glass I'm going to give the track pad of B minus I expect Intel CPUs to run hot but we're in the menu and it's already at 100째 like oh dear oh God what's happening why is this so terrible this is actually unplayable right now all right we are back in rocket league but I have Hardware info open we are looking at 100째 on the core but we are not having any more issues with the dropping down to like 7 FPS maybe what we needed was just a restart so if you're looking at a laptop that is mostly just for like
schoolwork and office stuff and things like that but on occasion you want to be able to game this is probably going to be a pretty good option all right we've now been playing rocket league for 2 minutes this is not a very accurate way to do this but 46째 where's here 46.8 all of it is very hot labs when they were doing their testing and they had extended gaming sessions found that the keyboard got up to 53째 C which is the sort of thing that will actually burn you if you touch it for too long that
said the keys themselves are pretty nice and cool and the bits that I'm actually touching are okay but everything surrounding the keys will actually give you a first-degree burn if you hold your hands there for long enough ow and in here we have a four speaker setup two on top two on the bottom this is another situation where dedicated graphics gets four speakers integrated only gets two totally different laptops but let's see if it  bumps ooh that's even better when you have a solid surface below you the
treble bounces off of it and it actually sounds really quite decent I think given the price of this those are perfectly acceptable speakers hopefully we'll be able to actually do proper testing on the sound of laptop soon I am very excited for that all right let's see how the webcam looks it's really not too bad it's exposing well for my face there is definitely some ghosting issues but it is 1080p okay it does definitely struggle at times like I am both blown out and look like that I have been in
the sun without sunscreen for 48 hours but if you're lit in a somewhat reasonable way it is able to figure it out and if you want people not looking at you boom there's a little switch right there that just completely disables it I love to see that thank you for putting it on there Dell unfortunately we don't have any IR emitters so we don't have Windows hello facial recognition but we do have a little fingerprint reader right here so you can get into your laptop nice and
easy nine Phillips screws later two of which are captive so they pop this off we are inside and this is actually looking incredible for upgradeability given that the year is 2024 we have our SSD right here and spot for a second SSD right here now the second SSD will have to be a very small boy but at the same time you can get 2 tbte ssds of this size Chuck it in there it's way better than nothing and that's what most other brands will give you we also have an upgradeable Wi-Fi card
right here so you can go to Wi-Fi 7 in the future if you so choose and the most incredible bit we have upgradable Ram soams hell yes so many laptop makers are either going to just not having any upgrade ability or just even worse the chip makers aren't even allowing it looking at the cooling solution it is shockingly robust given the CPU temperatures in here we have four heat pipes two fans and we also have four heat sinks which looks like it should be able to dissipate a fair bit of heat
well not that one's going straight into a hitge but the rest should be able to dissipate a fair bit of heat even if it didn't really do that in the real world what I suspect is if you rip this thing off and throw some liquid metal in there you'll be able to get much better temperatures and if you're going in here to like upgrade the Ram or something in a couple of years anyway that might really bring this thing back from the dead what certainly won't be dead though is this laptop well it will die
eventually but it will take quite some time because it has a 90w hour battery in it we able to see over 10 hours of battery life on this away from the wall which is quite impressive given that it has a dgpu and an Intel CPU one final test for upgradeability wow they have a super small SSD in here by default so you could just Chuck it right there get a fullsize SSD and Bam you're off to the race and it passes the double-sided SSD test so you can check a double-sided SSD in there the repairability of this has
really helped my overall opinion of it so many laptops don't have that so then the Dell Inspiron 16 plus is this a laptop that you want if you want to do hardcore gaming hardcore video editing professional photo editing really hardcore anything at all no but this is a laptop that is not crap at anything it has good enough gaming performance a great keyboard a good enough display if you're just doing casual video editing or photo editing and it will just be a friend for a long
time because you can upgrade it man have I mentioned yet that you can upgrade it it's just a pretty good laptop just like you're a pretty good viewer hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day see you later
