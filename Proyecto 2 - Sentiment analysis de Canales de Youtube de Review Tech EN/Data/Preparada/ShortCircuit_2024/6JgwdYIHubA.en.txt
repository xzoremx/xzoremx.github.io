the Asus g16 and 14 are some of the best gaming laptops on the market but what if they have one feature that you really want a touchcreen well that's what we've got here today this right here is Asus Pro art p16 and it is basically the g16 but in professional makeup let's have a look and this video is sponsored by AMD how much power is AMD going to get to consume well apparently 200 Watts according to the power adapter which just powered with asus's proprietary rectangle connector thing it's like USB
type-c but more efficient and less convenient let's see does this tell me to plug it in and turn it on yep there we go plug it in press the power button hell yeah where your Story begins not a single thing happened until you got an Asus laptop well my first impressions are this is one slab a laptop right here there's not a whole lot going on design wise on the back I guess coming from the G 16 that might be kind of nice if you don't want like a great big LED animated display back here 
fingerprints the p16 comes in at 4 lb or 1.8 kilog that is pretty darn good given the power that I know this thing has inside of it also the I/O is very solid headphone microphone combo Jack USB type a USB 4 HDMI 2.1 and on the other side fullsize SD card reader I love to see that so many others are going to the small ones this is fantastic if you're doing stuff like photo shoots and you want to be able to just quickly throw your SD card reader in there and of course another USB type
A around the back there is only exhaust actually looking at the specs it's only 17.3 mm thick which is pretty darn good normally expect something to be more around 20 not that 2 and 1/2 mm is really going to change your day all right opening up here it is very similar to the g16 which does share the same chassis I need to move this off of the uh mat here but this is one hell of a stiff chassis like I am properly sending it here and like I can't quite tell when it's the laptop moving and when it's the
table underneath it they're pretty  yeah this keyboard is fantastic it doesn't get full full marks like I think that they could have a tiny bit more texture and tactility to the actuation of the keys but uh yeah it's pretty good I'm going to give this a solid a for the keyboard and I think the trackpad might get an A+ like look at how much space they have used up with this thing they literally could not have more of it here overall the tracking on it is fantastic fantastic I have not run out of space on
it at all and of course we have this little thingy up in the top so if you want to use it you can swipe from the top right just like that you can now see that it's turned on using the dial here you can see that I can just change the system brightness wow this screen goes dark imagine this right here is Lightroom and we're changing the brightness of a photo or something like that it's actually a really nice sort of analog way to adjust something like this and also you can adjust if co-pilot's on
by hitting the button oh that's pretty good what I'm looking for right now is that we have an OLED panel with a touchcreen digitizer on the front of it and I have seen a lot of panels in the past where the two won't quite line up because the touchscreen digitizer was made for an LCD panel this right here does have a tiny bit of those artifacts like you can kind of see it as a graininess but I can only start seeing it about right here and I would normally be using this
computer right about here where it's not a problem at all so it's not a problem at all for the display we've got what Asus calls their Lumina OLED so this is 16 by10 4K and unfortunately it is just 60 HZ but because it's OLED your response times will be lower so it's not going to be brutal to use like a 60 HZ LCD like this is still pretty Snappy and responsive even if I can sort of see the pointer Trails there if you can see that on the monitor it also has a max brightness of 500 nits 100% coverage of
DCI P3 Inc comes color calibrated from the factory so you can just trust that the colors that you see here are the colors that everyone else will see assuming that their monitors are also color calibrated roughly of course though the thing that we are looking for is this WOW touchscreen maybe you care about it maybe you don't but if you do this is a pretty good laptop to be looking into but of course if you have a beautiful 4K display that is no good if you don't have the power to back up the
programs that you run on it but but fortunately we have that here with the AMD ryzen AI 9 HX 370 this thing has 12 cores 24 threads and goes up to 5.1 GHz with a 70 W TDP for just the processor itself which means this should be fairly rapid for professional programs for memory we have 32 GB at 7500 megat transfers per second which means it's probably not able to be upgraded but it is also very fast we have a 1 TB SSD mediate Tech WI ii7 an npu that is good for 50 tops of performance and of course
your GPU which is an RTX 460 which is good for many more tops of AI performance if that's what you're looking for my notes say that the 4070 which is optional will go up to 321 tops I'm not totally sure what the 4060 we have here is capable of that said though it definitely has 8 GB of vram don't worry about the AI it's 40% more efficient that's the bit that really matters your battery life is way better with these processors all right let's try out some of the AI grunt of this
with Muse tree this apparently allows you to generate AI images and become more creative either way it's a bunch of image generation that is on your computer so it doesn't have to send all your data and crap to the cloud and you don't have to be spending money using generated tokens and crap so create my muse tree how to ruin the portter potty okay so here we have several porta potties that's not quite what we're  poty there we go this is what all of your computational resources are for we
can burn the world down with AI but at least we'll have strange looking dog outside of portapotty giant cat knocking down  no I wonder if it will be better with just out my help at all there we go that one's sort of something we just spend so much time on that all right let's have a little game of Rocket League here so we're looking at about around 100ish FPS with this 4060 the responsiveness does seem like it's really quite good and the colors of this dis display are fantastic
it is a bit of a let down that it's only 60 HZ but at the same time I am currently getting like 120 FPS well screen recording and this is a pretty decent time especially for a laptop whose intent is not really gaming it's supposed to be a Creator first laptop in here we do have asus's ice cool Pro thermal technology which gets us up to 120 wats of combined system power which is pretty impressive given the size of this thing you were just able to hear the fans on during rocket league and
even though when you lift it up it's kind of loud against the table it's pretty silent and this does also have liquid metal inside of it these speakers don't kick ass I'm going to be mad okay  decent oh yeah there we go you've got the base the treble is clear it's not just the Starting All To Hell and you can tell by the fact that I'm kind of yelling right now that it's plenty loud good job Asus they have a webcam turnoff switch right here I do really like to see that and this webcam also looks
pretty darn good I'm not getting any super strange colors on my face that I can tell it's struggling a tiny bit here when I point it directly at a bright Studio light but it's still mostly exposing for my face if I turn around here it still is exposing for my face really quite well it's not blowing out even though this side is way darker than this side so whatever image processing they're using is pretty darn good and of course it also has Windows hello facial recognition up top and a fingerprint
reader in the power button right here which is my favorite combo for getting in because no matter what you're doing you can probably get in through one of those ways all right 11 T6 screws later two of which were underneath rubber feet and we are in do make sure if you take this apart that you organize where all of your screws go because they are different lengths keep it organized like with our little magnetic spots with our Precision screwdriver set from LT store.com in here things are looking
pretty good down below we have a 90w hour battery which an hour testing was able to get 8 hours and 5 minutes in our endurance test which is pretty good but not exceptional but also really quite good given that this has an OLED display and those can really use a lot of power I sure that is Ada of by the AMD processor in here for upgradability on the right we have our 1 SSD and on the left right here you can put a second one will a double-sided SSD go in yep double-sided SSD all good in here we can
also see asus's thermal design which is pretty interesting we have four heat pipes none of which are particularly large but we also have three fans this one down here is good for just cooling down stuff like your vrms your ssds pulling in air across everything and it is sectioned off via a little bit of foam from your main fans which are Prim arily just going to be shooting air out of those heat sinks back there now before pricing AMD is doing a giveaway down below so you can get one of these
for free which would be very awesome this one that we have right here with 32 GB of RAM and a 4060 is a Canada only model that comes in at $2600 Canadian or about "$1,870 us which is not too bad of a deal" but strangely in the US you need to go much more expensive and much more more computer the US config starts with 64 GB of RAM 2 terab of storage and a 4070 for $2700 that's a lot of money but that's also a lot a lot of computer so yeah if you're in the US maybe drive up here to
get a cheap laptop the people are nice so it'll be worth it just like AMD was really nice to sponsor this video check out the links down in the description enter that giveaway and have a great old day hit like get subscribed and I'll see you later
