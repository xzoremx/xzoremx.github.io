even if the Aon Neo slide was the worst product ever which it's not I probably still love it because this is the cutest packaging that I think I have ever seen for anything ever you slide a little VHS tape box out of a VHS tape sleeve and inside you are getting one of the most unique handheld gaming PCs that we have seen yet we're expecting performance to be about on par with devices like the Lenovo Legion go and the Seuss Rog Ally since it's using a ryzen 77840 u which is functionally the same
as the Z1 extreme except it has some additional AI nonsense bolted onto it but you are getting it in a form factor that might be a little bit on the thick boy side but includes a full freaking physical keyboard I mean that's one of the biggest pain points when you're using anything other than a steam deck Windows is just not designed to be used with joysticks and buttons and boom having access to a keyboard like that combined with io's ispace software which has pretty good joy to Mouse the last
time that I touched it should make it a lot easier to do things like enter a product key or log into your Microsoft account or just all that crap that you have to do with Windows let's have a look at accessories real quick all black just matte black absolutely everything nice compact power brick this bad boy will do up to 65 w love to see it also love that it uses a detachable cable so that I'm not stuck with whatever length they happen to ship me oh various region adapters for the
wall wart it looks like it comes with the North American one pre-installed at least for me this is cool though I also get a couple of USBC to usba dongles this could either be useful I guess if I wanted to use a usba cable off of here I probably wouldn't do that or if I wanted to convert either of the devices dual USBC ports to a USB type A let's pull these off so we can take a closer look on the top you're going to find a fingerprint sensor power button volume rocker one USBC Port this is USB 4 so
might be able to use it with some Thunderbolt accessories might not your mileage may vary we've got a total of oo those are they really do feel really nice two hall effect triggers two regular shoulder buttons and then two additional L4 R4 buttons I don't know cuz this would be your threes and then normally four would be here but it's not it's here they're pretty hard to reach without accidentally touching the shoulders but if you have bigger hands I could see using them for something I
guess on the bottom we've got another USB 4 Port I really like to have the option of having it either plugged in the bottom or the top cuz if you're sitting the bottom is great instead of having it hanging off the top and kind of dragging it down but if you're lying in bed having it come out the bottom is a great way to damage your cable down here there's also a Micro SD slot and a couple of stereo speakers kind of wish they were forward facing but io's done some pretty good stuff with the audio on
their devices in the past so they might end up sounding pretty good on the face we've got very serviceable ABX y buttons a really nice compact form factor especially considering how big some of these devices have gotten lately look at you Legion go these joysticks also haul effect with RGB accent lighting what feels immediately like a pretty serviceable d-pad and then of course your start select whatever those are on an Xbox controller an iio space button and a return to desktop button the big
star of the show is of course the display and ah yes that's right you guys saw that the 30° of tilt that IO is extremely proud of unlike previous similar devices that we've seen before like the GPD Win 4 this is a more powerful and B the first that we've seen that has a screen that tilts like this for they claim and honestly I can't see any reason to doubt this improved ergonomics this yeah that it means that I don't have to here you can't really see this because of the gorgeous Dropout hoodie
that I'm wearing LTT store.com but in order to be looking straight at the screen i' would normally have to bend my wrist back at this angle instead they do the wrist bending for you keeping you aligned while you're sitting at a desk and resting your console on the surface of it ah this is a problem while the display reached a whopping 500 nits that's 100 more than what they rate it for and achieved pretty decent performance when it comes to color accuracy it's 60 htz which is a big
disadvantage compared to the Rog Ally and the steam deck OLED not to mention the limo of Legion go though I don't know how many people are buying that one but it is not touchscreen after filming we found out it's just our pre-production unit that doesn't have a touchcreen retail units do thank goodness let's go ahead and fire up a game shall we or talk about our sponsor step into 2024 with confidence thanks to manscaped and their performance package 5.0 Ultra it includes the lawn mower 5.0
Ultra so you can now mow your lawn if you know what I mean it includes their weed whacker 2.0 for your ears and nose so it doesn't look like a kraken is trying to escape from up there it includes their crop Soother and crop preserver to keep your nether region smelling fresh though it should be noted that no one at Short Circuit or Linus Media Group or any of its Affiliated companies recommends hurting yourself trying to check anything like that but what you should check is the performance
package 5.0 ultr manscape.com circuit and use code circuit to get 20% off free shipping and two free gifts holy crap this fan moves air I guess that's one of the advantages of having a thicker body is you can put like I can feel this blowing air this fraking far away from it that looks like a gigantic cooler okay I guess now's a good time for us to talk about the various performance modes that are available on this device rather than just naming them after wattages they've
got AAA game mode which runs at 23 Watts but we turned all the way up to 28 Watts so we could see exactly how much it could do in our testing they got normal game mode retro game mode and office mode which are 20 watts 15 watts and then 9 Watts respectively we are obviously in AAA game mode right now because a this thing is consuming about 28 Watts between the CPU and the GPU and B it is crushing Doom maternal despite being a little tiny handheld device oh had a little bit of lag there
but what are we set to because I think that this is set to a very unreasonable level of detail right now this looks absolutely spectacular yeah it's set to ultra nightmare quality that's not fair let's go to medium especially at 1080p resolution on these mobile chipsets anything above that is a lot to ask even for an older AAA game like do maternal you can see right now though I'm getting like 50 55 FPS this is very playable I will say though ah coming from a device like the Ally which
is what I'm daily driving right now the screen is a little small and it's not just you know oh I'm old and I can't see very well like your HUD elements are just kind of tiny sharp though I mean 1080p at this size what is this like 6 in okay 6 in that's a lot of pixel density I mean that's like having a 4k monitor that was only 12 in diagonally literally I turned the speakers off before to get some idea of how loud the cooling system is and I got to say given how long we've had Doom maternal running
this is pretty impressive not to mention that the CPU and GPU are both in the 60° range right now that is extremely reasonable honestly if I was the one designing the fan profile for this I'd probably let them run a little bit hotter and just have it be even quieter though even this is not necessarily a problem let's turn on the volume a little bit yeah they're downward firing and I've seen some pretty incred magic done with downward firing speakers but it does not appear to be present at this
time uh okay let's uh let's lose do maternal this is cool though ah shortcut I see um I don't know I don't know what I've done hello buddy hello no um that's another thing a&amp;o is proud of with this device is they support gyroscopic a ging so that's something that you can actually configure in a wide variety of games with third party tools I do need to figure out how to fix the resolution of this display real quick though come here you that was weird oh the RGB on the joysticks uh we found the
configuration to be a little rough IA space I really really liked it in the first couple of iterations and it feels like there's a lot of things that have almost regressed at this point there we go RGB lighting effect RGB breathe personally I'm not a huge fan of having RGB on these anyway just because I find it really distracting when I'm gaming I always turn it off whoo no way the keyboard is back lit though yep okay that's pretty cool that I care about because if I'm in the dark
trying to type I can find my joysticks right like but if I'm in the dark trying to type something that's really useful to have this is nice quick toggles brightness ooh you can change trigger sensitivity that's really nice Hall of Fame triggers yeah yeah can adjust the gyro sensitivity that's super cool as well it's just a matter of whether this will come up when you're in game or not that's the trouble that I've had lately wow you can totally just set up your own profile it's doing the thing where the
mouse and the controller are both trying to fight for control this is not good let's see cyberpunk on this thing in mute fan mode it'll have to ramp up I just want to see how quiet it can manage to stay uh oh dang it I don't have an FPS counter I mean I can tell you guys it's in the like 3540 range oh God the I thing is in the way now oh God oh God it's controlling everything oh God oh God all right hey look did I nail it or what though FPS 38 why do I even need an FPS counter I
don't know we are running in Steam deck optimized mode with Fidelity effect super resolution but we're running at 1080p which the steam deck wouldn't be and we're still getting I mean 1% lows of 29 33 35 this is not a very dense area right now it was a little bit lower before pretty darn impressive and we found that performance was really solid across the board it makes sense given that this is a Z1 extreme with good cooling did I say good cooling cuz I think I kind of mean great cooling now
that I put it in silent mode yeah they're up at around 70° and the controller is a little bit too hot I'd say maybe don't operate in that mode unless you're extremely sensitive to  it that's freaking awesome even battery life is decent it's got a 46w hour battery so that's squarely in between the original steam deck and the newer steam deck OLED which gave it okay under an hour in our stress test but that's true of realistically any of these gaming handhelds and a very respectable
over 4 hours in our endurance test so you'd expect depending on the profile you're running in depending on your screen brightness you're going to be getting anywhere from probably a couple of hours of gaming to in excess of 4 hours or even 5 hours if you're just playing you know some Sprite based kind of retro Style game and you keep your screen dim H nice small dead zones on the joysticks though that's always nice to see yeah really responsive of course nothing we've talked about so far really
addresses the main selling point of this device and that's the keyboard so enough cyberpunk let's play some Mavis Beacon Davis Beacon online let's go my battery just die it did warn me fairness it's going to be $6.99 in the Indiegogo for the base spec that is with the Z1 extreme equivalent though and then as you go up in Ram and storage and all of that the price goes up quite a bit now it should be noted all of our performance testing was at ddr5 at 6400 but the Finish device is expected
to go a little bit higher with a new bios we just didn't have that available to us at the time of testing so it might perform a little bit better as well hello buddy can you oh I guess this is the thing right during testing we encountered a couple of instances where the screen just powered off this thing's on but the screen no worky hopefully that's another thing that they could sort out in firmware like the lack of a touch screen ioner has let us know that these issues will be resolved in the
full production units oh I I guess I realized I didn't even really comment on this mechanism it's great as long as you don't try to use it one-sided that's not great that's fine that's fine that is not very fine yeah I don't think we're playing Mavis Beacon I think we're defeated just like you'll be defeated if you don't stay subscribed to Short Circuit so you always know what's going on
