the last time I looked at a smartwatch it was the $70 cmf watch Pro 2 and it did a lot of stuff pretty dang well so it makes it hard to justify a $300 Smartwatch from the likes of Samsung but the cmf watch wasn't perfect there's a lot of weird software quirks and I'm expecting that Samsung is going to bring a far more luxurious and a bit of extra experience to the table that cmf just can't provide and just looking at it already from the hardware alone you can tell that this is a more premium product
I think the band with its nice ribbing for my pleasure is uh pretty cool I also like these blue and orange kind of accents these little tiny little bits of fabric I like them a lot but before I get too entice by this let's see what else is in the Box we got a long Samsung box and inside we have a charger uh classic Wireless this is my preferred type of charging it's a magnetic cradle um you can lay on the watch in any direction and it will charge which is nice which means that you don't have to
Fumble around to try and get it lined up exactly how you want on the other side it is a a bunch of oh that's the look ain't that just the it's bound it's a bound book it's the cutest little book you could read it to your mice friends other than that that's all you get outside of that you get the watch 7 the first thing I noticed about it is it's missing a fan favorite feature that would be the rotating bezel that they got rid of and then they brought back on the six classic now we have a just a
normal screen bezel that is touch sensitive so you can still kind of do the turn the bezel action you can still scroll like that but it doesn't have the same physical satisfaction speaking of physical satisfaction we got nice buttons on the side that are very clicky as well as actually capacitive if I'm not mistaken they can detect if you're just touching like this on the bottom we have Optical sensors for tracking stuff like your blood oxygen and your heart rate we have a infrared thermometer
right there a pressure vent for when you're going swimming and stuff like that and then on the side here we got our little microphone it is Aluminum but has a nice premium finish the lugs are 20 mm apart and have a standard Mount so you don't have to use some sort of weird proprietary connection system you can swap this out with any watch band that you might already own and it's going to be really easy to find replacements love to see it and on the front we have our display behind sapphire glass and it
looks pretty dang nice and I'll give you a little sneak peek at it after you get a sneak peek of our sponsor thanks to NZXT for sponsoring this video their C1500 is a 1500 watt 80 plus Platinum certified power supply this level of Energy Efficiency means less power consumption and a cooler and quieter system it's fully modular so that's easier and cleaner cable management for you plus it's 180 mm form factor means more case space and better air flow get yours today using the link in the video
description off camera we went through setup nothing to note pretty smooth setup and this is the watch face you start with and um I I don't really like it that much it's trying to do like a weird interesting like number thing like right now it's 2 p.m. or I guess it's almost 3 but this has a two in the background it's just not very readable to me um and I also just am not a huge fan of the style luckily a lot of these watch faces are like very customizable you can change the background color you
can change your hands you can change your hand color you can change your complications so if I don't want UV on the side I can go through a whole host of different ones that they have I will say that it's not as flexible as say some of the pixel watch faces where you can literally just put like a link to any app on your device here the app has to support the Samsung like home screen it's not quite as robust luckily just to the side you can put various different widgets from all sorts of different apps
anything that seems relevant to you as well as you can navigate this quickly by using that touch sensitive bezel wow when you're moving through these you have these dots at the top that indicate your place in the menus and it does not like line up in a simple way with the uh bezel so I find it's a little imprecise so it doesn't save me much time compared to just swiping like that maybe we can fine-tune it I'm not quite sure they have lots of like tons of watch faces as well as you can
download any watch face you want from the Google Play store or maybe if they would prefer they probably want you to go through the Samsung store but who's going to use that this is my preferred watch face I like it cuz it has many complications on it I can do the weather I can see the forecast step count battery speaking of battery this thing uh it's pretty good uh I used it for a little bit earlier and it got a day about a day and a half on a full charge without me kind of stressing too much
about it that's including having like Health sensors on 24/7 but the always on display was not always on I always saw like a movie and stuff like that and I kept it off I would expect that if you're like kind of heavily using it and you want tracking on all the time you can expect a full day to a day and an overnight sleep tracking session and then you're going to need to get this on the charger which is good for me cuz I like to just keep my charger at work though it really would be nice if I
didn't have to really stretch it through the weekend Samsung has been making uh their watch OS for a long time it's tried and true it's familiar you get way too many included Samsung apps that you just don't want but you do have access to all sorts of apps that you can add yourself um and the nice thing about the Samsung watches is that it integrates really well with all of these apps basically every app has support for the Samsung watch in some capacity which is great because for my main use case for
SmartWatches it is the health tracking and Samsung does quite a good job their health tracking app is really robust um there's tons of stuff in it there's a lot of free uh exercise videos and stuff like that if you if that's your speed it honestly does a lot more in a single app than anything that Google currently offers I feel like in typical Google fashion a lot of their stuff is spread out like between their fit app and then there's their Fitbit app and the Fitbit app has been getting a bit better lately
in terms of kind of bringing all of those tracking features and health features into into one single area but Samsung feels like they offer a lot more without having to pay a subscription uh which I appreciate I also found that heart rate track in seems accurate and they actually can measure your body composition with this watch which to preface there's not really a good way to measure your body composition even the dexa scan which is a current gold standard for measuring body composition can be very very
inaccurate and varies wildly depending on how much water or food you've eaten it's it's hard to do this claims to be as good as a dexa scan I don't know if I believe it and I don't really have a good way of verifying it but it should be known that this is going to be using bio impedance which is like it'll send a small current through the buttons and to the bottom of the watch and it creates a circuit and the amount of resistance you get will be roughly what your body composition is if that sounds kind of
crazy and imprecise that's because it is I think it's cool that they offer it because even if something is relatively imprecise and is inaccurate you can still see a general Trend especially if it's the first thing you do when you wake up but take it with a grain of salt I will say that that using the UI is really Snappy and really fluid and that's probably thanks to their new exos w1000 chipset that they have in here on top of Speedy performance the chip also provides you with LTE and GPS so you can
take this pretty much anywhere in the world including into water because it is ip68 water resistant and the casing is rated for up to five atmospheres of pressure I also think that the way this thing handles notifications and stuff like that is really good it syncs well with the phone at least it's a does a great job of syncing well with a Samsung phone Samsung can be a bit annoying when it comes to working with devices outside of their ecosystem for example you can't use this with an iPhone at all even the
$70 watch or any Fitbit can be used with an iPhone it's dumb it's dumb that they close themselves off from that market it really just allows people to kind of funnel into the Apple watch ecosystem which is like cool it just seems like a I don't know a bad idea if your Samsung to just like let them take it and although it works with any Android phone you won't be able to take advantage of the Galaxy AI features on here unless you have a new Samsung phone how much are you missing from that tough to say
depends on how much those AI features matter to you I personally don't care but it's just frustrating that they are locking these features and trying to pull the same annoying anti-consumer behavior that Apple does when it comes to trying to lock you into an ecosystem as opposed to just playing nicely samung I just want you to be better than Apple let Apple users use your watch because Apple's never going to let us plebians use an Apple Watch right for me the 40mm version of this watch is a great size I
think it's a great product it feels fully fledged I've run into almost no bugs in my time using it it runs super smoothly I think the battery life is adequate but it's kind of Overkill at its $300 price point for someone like me who is mainly looking for those Health tracking features like tracking my heart rate because I have atrial fibrillation or tracking my workouts when I'm at the gym especially and and this is a big thing is I think for a lot of people you really only need like that $200 $150 fit
bit to get 90% of what you want they don't come with the same premium build and I do I I will say that I think that this looks a little bit cooler and a little bit better than say your average Fitbit it's a little bit more generic a little bit less sporty so it doesn't look quite like a tracker more like an actual watch I think for most people at $300 you should really consider something a bit cheaper unless you really want to go full Nomad no phone and put a SIM in this thing I love it
Samsung knows exactly what they're doing when it makes a smartwatch but I wouldn't put my money towards it would you let us know in the comments down below thanks for watching short circuit if you like this video why don't you check out my last video on the cmf watch Pro 2 it's a lot cheaper at $70 and the software might be a little bit wonky but it might just be the right fit for you
