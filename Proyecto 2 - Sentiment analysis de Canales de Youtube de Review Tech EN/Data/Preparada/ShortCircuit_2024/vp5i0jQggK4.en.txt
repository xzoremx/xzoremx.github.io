now I don't usually start a video with a shout out to our sponsor but if it wasn't for dbrand I would not even have my hands on the Huawei mate XT ultimate design this phone is so exclusive that these are going for about "$9,000 on eBay right now the hilarious" part is they don't even make accessories for it no cases no skins no nothing because it's China exclusive and I'm pretty sure they don't let DeBrands SK into China anymore after all this they've pulled over the years so we've
got that in common anyway without further Ado massive shout out dbrand for getting this phone over to us however the hell it is you did that unlike a lot of our recent phone videos there's no Labs testing or anything it arrived we jumped through a bunch of freaking ridiculous Hoops to set up a Huawei cloud account and I jumped on set I am so excited to see this thing you will pay for this that's my garage door why is my garage door open that's a really weird anded up thing to have in the
packaging is this from dbrand yes wow it's freaking huge I have looked at basically no media coverage of this thing because I wanted to experience it in person it's got about the same crease as I would have expected on like a first generation folding device but what jumps out to me is the astonishing thinness I'm daily driving an iPhone 16 plus right now this is the thickness of the iPhone in comparison it's on a whole other level I am loving the design too Huawei has gone from being just like a copycat
brand to this looking absolutely incredible dude it's basically as thin as it could possibly be and still have a SIM tray I've seen concept devices for like a trifold for example on the Samsung booth at CES the difference is that even their concept devices weren't this thin that is not an IR emitter shut up it has an IR emitter this is a device that I look at and I go yeah they couldn't have fit a headphone jack in here not this one on the right volume rocker what appears to be a fingerprint
sensing lock button USBC Port look at this can you even see the edges of it how is there room in this thickness at the edge of this port for the entire display stack is this leather it can't be can't be real leather it's got to be a faux leather but it feels really good oh oh it's folded oh dang that is so cool oh buddy in there yeah that's cool it's like a folded metal oh oh oh what what else is in the Box oh important reminder thank you Andy right I forgot Andy's my cameraman today oh
this this Buddy ain't waterproof I'll tell you that much don't go where it's cold don't touch it with anything sharp don't touch it at all don't fold it if it's under 5° oh - 5 I can see why they didn't bring it to the Canadian Market this is the kind of thing that feels like they built a concept car and then they were just like you know what it we'll make a handful of them you know like it reminds me of that uh that Sony OLED from 2008 they were just like yeah this thing makes absolutely no
sense at this price and size we're going to do it anyway oh it comes with Huawei earphones now I know that these are a thing that's good shut up 88 watt charging on this thing there's no way yeah okay this is an 8 Watt wait why does it come with comes with a car charger does it come with a reg oh dude this thing is the whole package regular charger 66 WS two cables oh it comes with a case that's great this carbon fiber oh my God I think this is real carbon fiber the reason I think it's
real is a it looks real and B they know there isn't going to be a single accessory on the market for this so whatever comes in the box that's the only possible case that body can get for it which means if you have the kind of money to afford a phone like this it better be a good one how much does this cost in China it's not even that much "like to be clear $2,800 is a freaking" ton for a phone but you'd spend almost that much on a top tier iPhone especially if you pay for Apple Care
which this includes similar service too it includes four Replacements of the screen protector in the first two years and a full out broken screen so it's not beyond the realm of what people are spending on phones it's just that uh that's for 16 gigs of RAM and only 256 gigs of storage I don't even know how they put a n chip in here let alone 250 you can get it with up to a terabyte of storage but that's going to cost you "$3,400 $1.2 in display absolute freaking" game changer for on the-go entertainment
3K resolution 92% screen to body ratio I believe it look how tiny these bezels are it's like a Samsung Galaxy fold plus a third phone this thing's crazy like pretty good anti- glare treatment it's not perfect but like guys that that's a studio light you know oh that's cool it prompts you for the password down in the bottom right cuz it knows how you're going to be holding it oh you can tell it if you're right or left-handed or if you're holding it shut up shut up Andy
said if you're holding it with your left hand no way oh they did the work man I've been using a fed since the first generation Samsung Galaxy fooled okay and with those early ones you could really tell like it was basically stock Android but like with some tablet tweaks and you know they didn't really have it all figured out dude it moves where the pin prompt is depending where you swipe that is freaking awesome it's little touches like that that make all the difference in the world with a device
like this it comes pre-loaded with a lot of garbage that I know is pretty typical for Chinese devices we've talked about three screens two okay how does it feel in the s that is smooth the way it transitions you guys also this is totally a high refresh rate display what are the compromises people 90 htz which is good enough obviously 120 144 is better or whatever you're extreme gamer but if you're an extreme gamer you're not buying this phone now that I finally got it folded
down the whole way dude it's not even thicker than a bfold from Samsung and it's a trifold wow yeah it's thicker than a traditional candy bar phone but it's not totally unreasonable either like again as someone who used a fold for a long time it feels pretty good in the hand and not only that but this is such a usable form factor man do you remember how small the front screen was on the first Galaxy fold like it's tiny I made that work this would be basically no compromise is
no no I would go like this boom fold boom I got some movies to watch I want this thing so bad like so bad does it even work on Canadian bands come on wuwei it's not like we jailed your executive and kicked all your infrastructure out of our country or anything I'm going to try it I'm putting my Sim in it boys you can uninstall their garbage I can uninstall WWE wallet maybe blah blah blah yeah sure see you later okay cool so I don't have to keep any of that stuff in single window view
you could swipe up and down to either side to scroll oh that's a nice usability tweak dude this is crazy it's so thin it's so light let's talk about specs we got a Kiren 9010 7 NM chip in here 10.2 7.9 or 6.4 in display no particular Peak brightness rating though uh hey you got the Play Store and everything wait what the hell is an aurora store no Google Play services you can't even force it dang it so wait what am I how am I what am I supposed to watch on here then we
"did find one source that says 1,500 nits" "we found another source that said 1,000" nits either way it's pretty flipping bright this is not like your first generation folding displays where they're super dim and basically unusable outside looks a little yellow it's got a bit of a red cast compared to the iPhone but in terms of the brightness and SDR content I do not see any disadvantage here I will say this though the color accuracy is probably good enough for just about
anybody who's not doing color critical work on their phone and can your iPhone do this holy crap no your iPhone can't do that it looks like even when they're powering the whole display the overall brightness is close it might be a little bit less bright oh man the auto rotate it's like it's off like it's 90° off oh it doesn't know what mode I'm in oh that's uh H that's a that's a downer and a half you could see it's working fine in byold mode but then I switch over to trifold herp
herp perp the lock button like right there you're going to accidentally Mash that constantly but this is like caveman technology by comparison this is awesome you got to put all your apps in like a little like shuffly thing like a peasant d don't you even have a bigger screen Apple oh oh I want to try the camera though it has a variable aperture camera how the crap did they pull that off oh oh no way you can go all the way from f1.4 to F4 basically that affects how wide the hole is through which the
camera is shooting which affects the depth of field and affects how much light gets in so if I want to open it up all the way I can get real bokeh like not fake AI bokeh like real B on my shot that is super cool I can close it all the way and I can make sure that basically everything in my shot is in Focus okay let's go back to let's go back to auto mode though not the best I've seen not terrible pretty sharp actually 50 megapixels yeah you can count every one of them you can actually
read the brand of our tripod on the Huawei can barely make it out on the  hey man look at that look at it like stretch out more that is so cool dude I  bad wow that's some big sound boys one  here they're pretty muddy but given the space constraints I'm still very impressed I'm also impressed by how little the folds are bothering me once I've actually got content on the screen you can see as I move it around and catch the light you'll catch a glimpse of them once in a while especially when
it's directly reflected towards your eyes but overall pretty good at most of the angles that you would actually care about even though it does have an older processor in it they've got a 5600 mAh battery in here that'll help a lot you'll probably get a day out of it all right let's put on the case this little flappy guard thing kind of gets in the way when you go from Bold to trifold but apparently it's there cuz people were concerned about the unprotected screen here and like this
way it it's right there when you're holding it so I guess that's something oh yeah I was going to try out the stand oh yeah that could work there we go okay oh yeah oh yeah okay she's stable  stabilized oh yeah there we go no problem bud I mean look you laugh laugh all you want but this was an engineering challenge that someone at wuwei had to solve and they did a pretty pretty okay  nope a little inconsistent oh ah it'll be better without the case I think so much better nope it failed I think it
comes down to when I enrolled it it was kind of wonky because I had the case on I would definitely recommend enrolling with the case not on I want one so bad but there are multiple deal breakers here even if it did support North American bands which it may VAR well there's no Google services on here which doesn't mean oh yeah well just go get the Play Store and add Google surface no they won't run on it not unless you like I don't know rooe it somehow but then you're going to lose a lot of the
optimizations that Huawei has made to Harmony OS you literally cannot put the Play Store on here and you can't run Google apps like Google Maps for example wait Google Maps works ah I see the rotation bug pretty brutal and even though we have it set to English right now there are many aspects of the device that remain Chinese only there's no IP rating so you drop this thing in the drink it is dead and setting up an account in Canada was extremely difficult because Huawei devices are
aband in the country over security concerns finally the S SOC and Camera are well actually I thought the camera seemed pretty solid but the so is very last gen estimated to be about on par with a Snapdragon 888 which came out in 2020 I really want one though and I want you to subscribe to Short Circuit thanks again to dbrand for making it possible for us to get our hands on this thing I uh was not expecting it to blow my mind this effectively you can go check out debrand products for other devices maybe
their cases or skins or uh accessories for your PlayStation console you can check them out atl.com is that the vanity URL these days Yeah ironic that it's called a vanity URL
