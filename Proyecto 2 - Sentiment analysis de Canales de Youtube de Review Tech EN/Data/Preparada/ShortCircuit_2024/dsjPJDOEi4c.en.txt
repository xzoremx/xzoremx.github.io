here we've got the allnew Kia ev9 and it has a level of thought and care that I just did not know that KIA was capable of and this thing is absolutely fantastic I love the direction they're going in overall I think this car looks great they managed to make it like an electric vehicle but at the same time it doesn't look too stupid and bubbly it's also really impressive how they've been able to make it both boxy and aerodynamic this has a drag coefficient of 0.28 which means it cuts through the
air really well and it's also nice and quiet in the cabin although that said you have to remember that the force of drag is the frontal area times the coefficient of drag so it still is not going to be the most efficient ever in this awesome blue color I was expecting this thing to be getting plenty of attention especially since these have just arrived here in Canada but uh only one person did a double take and Buddy was getting out of his ev6 so you can be pretty down low in this thing I said
though let's look at the trunk in here we have a little bit of room about enough for a purse maybe some personal items but not quite enough for a full-on backpack but I do appreciate that they have at least something up here below the hood we have what Kia calls their Dynamic welcome lights which look really sweet and are incredibly annoying because uh this right here we have what's called their focus pattern as you can see there's a bunch that aren't even lit up in here and to change
that you have to give them $250 as a mic transaction so if I see anything other than the default patterns right here you are a chump you're an idiot moving to the side we have these really cool Arrow rims right here which I think stand out quite a bit compared to the stupid diamond cut rims that you find on everything else and also these tires do have foam insulation in them to help with nvh which really AIDS just how quiet this thing is in the cabin also it's a it's really freaking long this
thing's over 5 m long so check if it will fit in your garage you might have to move some shelves this being an EV they had to do something funky with the door handles and these ones right here that just pop out actually work really quite well around the back I continue to like The Styling like these lights right here and we also have a great big power lift gate that opens to reveal a trunk that's really not all that big in here we have enough room for about two backpacks and an Alex but that can be
improved fortunately if you only want to transport four people you can put the rear seats down and gain that space back and if you only want to transport two people the front ones can go down to giving you just this massive flat space right here where you might not be able to put a piece of plywood but you can put quite a bit of stuff as a bonus back here we get a full 120 volts 15 amps and there's a second one up there for a total of 3600 WS if you want to put a whole gaming rig in here or several
around the side we have our charging port and now I wasn't able to actually find the exact specs on this right here either way you're able to go 10 to 80% in just 24 minutes which is really impressive for something with nearly 100 Kow hours of battery this being a three row SUV I'm guessing the rear seats are essentially useless but let's give it a little look here okay not too bad not too bad oh oh okay honestly I'm pretty impressed I have decent head room the seat goes
forward and backwards I have charging back here and with these captain seats all the way forward I actually have pretty decent leg room like my knee is touching but I'm 6t and I was expecting to just be not able to sit back here at all this chair all the way forward can I sit in it still damn not bad aside we hitting my head on the camera I'm actually pretty comfy it's it's tight it's definitely tight but you can fit six actual full grown adults in here I'm kind of shocked if you don't have people
in the back though these seats are awesome they are heated they are cooled they are full most I back forward up and down these are better than the majority of seats I've sat in in the front of curvs let alone the middle also has a little foot rest which is way too small for me here we've got a sun shade that blocks the sun and the haters and up here we have a control panel which is pretty average but what's really interesting is they actually have two completely separate HVAC systems for the
front and the back so if you're doing stuff up there like you don't have anyone in the back it can fully turn this one off for better efficiency finally we've got a nice little bit of storage right here where I was able to put all of my turn-ups and potatoes when I forgot a bag at the farmers market hopping into the front seats these are some of the best seats I have ever sat in and with a single button press I can go into Lounge mode oh yes I don't entirely understand why you want Lounge mode but it is
pretty neat when you do it the first couple of times that said though aside from the gimmicks these are the best seats that I have ever sat in we have this little mesh thingy on the back of the headrest that feels a lot like those fancy Mercedes pillows and just so much adjustment we've got bolsters we've got your IR and even massage seats up here it is like nothing I have felt in AA by a mile in here overall the quality of the materials is exceptional we don't have piano black crap everywhere there
is some kind of glossy plastic here that's scratching a bit easily but everything else is great we've got these nice Fabrics we've got the fake Leathers we've got Plastics that are textured in such a way that I think they're going to wear really well compared to what we've been seeing in the past and we also have proper climate controls we have temperature here fan rate there and none of that junk climate and media in the same spot stuff that KIA has been doing for the last little while this is so
much better with my only small gripe being that you completely block all of the HVAC information with the wheel and in your hand it took me a really long time to figure out that it's all right here the infotainment is pretty standard Kia Hyundai stuff and it's overall just excellent they have some of the best and easiest to use stuff in the game and of course you're just going to be plugging in Apple carplay or Android auto anyway storage in here is also great we have a normal glove box which somehow is a
selling point in EVS right now a tiny little compartment that's about big enough for sunglasses here and a nice little area here that's large enough for a DJI transmission kit Warrior purse now turning on the ev9 is a little bit strange we've got a power button on a stock for some reason and you just give it a little twist here and it allows us to drive straight into the segue to our sponsor thanks to carlux for sponsoring today's video well the ev9 finally has Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto
some other cars such as Kia and Hundai in the recent past do not with the carlux Pro Plus you can say goodbye to the tethered life this wireless adapter runs on Android 133 touts an a core Qualcomm Snapdragon chip making it one of the fastest and most stable boxes on the market and with SIM card compatibility a bunch of pre-installed and downloadable apps such as YouTube and Netflix it can be fully functional even without a phone connected so say goodbye to intrusive cables and check
out the CarX Pro Plus at the link down below before we set off I want to quickly show out the 360 camera on this which is just exceptional it is an optional upgrade but I would recommend like there was a model y that could not get into a super small parking space but using this thing right here I was able to now even though this thing's 5800 lb we have 380 horsepower 516b of torque    this thing does a 0 to 100 in 5.3 seconds and if you want to get the all-wheel drive version that does go up
to six but that still is quite rapid that said though the 200 horsepower rear wheeel drive version takes over nine so maybe Splurge for the all wheel drive or  this it's pretty fun given how freaking huge it is the biggest difference though with this compared to every other Kia that I've been in is that the suspension is set up exceptionally this thing is very very heavy and you can tell but at the same time we're going over a really bumpy road right now it's nice and quiet
in here there's zero rattles and it's just really nice and comfy it's so nice that KIA was able to take what this car is intended to do which is just fairing around children being comfy and really really nail that in a way that I feel like they have not in the past we don't have any fancy air suspension adaptive dampers none of that it is just very simply well-tuned well thought out and good job guys by hitting the paddles on the back of the steering wheel you can change how much regenerative breaking
you get although I would suggest sticking to level three cuz that's where you get the most and I just really like Regen braking or go all the way to I pedal which gets you full regen braking and you can do full one pedal driving with this where without touching the brake you can come to a Full Stop one thing to note though is that when you enable ey pedal it disables the disconnect actuator system that's a disconnect on the front axle that separates the wheels from the electric
motor doing that gains you 6 to 8% efficiency so you will have longer range if you're not in the eye pedal but that said I found the range to be pretty good in this and I've just used ey pedal the whole time I like it all right we've got some Corners here we can just dip her in give it a little bit of gas and it feels really really good it's obviously not a sports car we have 5800 lb of mass and Kia are not magicians so you can definitely feel it and if you're going around corners that are bumpy at higher
speeds it can it can get a little bit confuzzled but that said the the steering is really accurate really responsive and like you're able to take Corners at speeds that you do not expect for this thing to be able to do again great job Kia on the suspension tuning of this thing and here we have the 14 speaker surround sound system from Meridian and it is fantastic it plays all the way down to 30 HZ so not quite the bassiest base but it is clean down to 30 HZ it also has excellent not
staging but surround sounded this it's a large car so they're able to just really bring it out and immerse you in the sound my only complaint is that the staging isn't perfect I do find that the center channel just kind of collapses to the mid that's right here which is a little bit unfortunate I do really wish that the center channel had collapsed to the center but that said it's pretty darn  by the way we just released these hats on LTT store.com this one's a prototype that I've been wearing for a year
working great another area that's excellent are the assists this has adaptive cruise which goes down to 0 km an hour and it's just overall really smooth really confidence inspiring I quite like it it also has auto lane centering and Lan keep assist both of which work quite well although that said I think that I work better so for the most part I turned it off but maybe you'll like it also great is the range the GT line that we have right here is good for 505 km if you're not into the
gas too much or if that's not enough for you the rear wheel drive can go for 563 km if you don't care about getting chopped by Priuses and finally the price now in Canada we get quite a good deal on these this one right here that we're in the absolute top trim is "$81,000 Canadian but if you're in the" states the same top trim is "$76,000 which is uh a lot more expensive" so overall the Kia ev9 it's freaking fantastic I cannot believe how much Kia has improved on their formula of like
the ev6 which was just didn't really do it for me and now we've arrived here to something that I hope all of the design decisions get carried over into their other cars the climate control and stuff just so much better the ride quality is exceptional and it's just so comfy so quiet so easy to use if you're looking for something to just be a very simple electric car for your everyday life it's great I really like it just like I really like you for watching this video hit like get subscribed and just have a
fantastic all day see you later
