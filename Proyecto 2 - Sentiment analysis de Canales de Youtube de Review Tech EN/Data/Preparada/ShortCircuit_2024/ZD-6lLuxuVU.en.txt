we're visiting Lenovo at CES to check out the Lenovo thinkbook plus Gen 5 and let's go somewhere a little bit quieter  it what now you might think me a fool but I knew exactly what was going to happen because this is the plus Gen 5 hybrid and what does that mean well that means it's not just a laptop that runs windows it's also an Android tablet and cool anybody can dual boot Android or emulate Android but it's not quite like that as you may have known noticed Windows is still
operating what the heck well they've done some pretty clever work here and I'm really excited to talk about it so this laptop is powered by an Intel Core 7 Ultra 155h which puts it kind of firmly in the thin and light category not the most powerful processor but still meteor like and one of Intel's latest it also comes equipped with 32 gigs of RAM on here the laptop itself is made of aluminum with brush aluminum on the sides the bottom panel however is plastic um but it's still a very premium finish
and I think looks pretty slick it comes with a thunderbolt 4 port on either side as well as a combo headphone jack we also see at the back nothing but just some venting we have lots of vents on the side which bodess well for cooling almost like our sponsor thanks to be quiet for sponsoring our 2024 CES coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include power supplies case fans PC cases for said
case fans all-in-one water coolers and high performance air coolers with fruits in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are hard to hear this year at CES they're showcasing new white PC cases white fans and even white hard drive cages step into the world of quiet cooling with be quiet at the link down below and one of the biggest giveaways is that this is a tablet as you can see these cameras out here we'll talk about those in a minute
let's keep on the laptop front the laptop itself contains two speakers but when you are docked you get to take advantage of the additional four speakers that are in the tablet so you get six speakers so theoretically it could get pretty loud who knows how good it will sound again thin and light laptops not exactly famous for uh sound quality so right now we're hearing the audio from just the two speakers in the bottom of the laptop and listen it's pretty loud in here and uh these don't sound very good uh
but when we attach our  it starts playing the audio through all of the speakers on the device the six including the six on the side and the bottom and it still sounds not that great but you get to take advantage of a touchscreen it comes with Lenovo stylus you have a great touchpad but the real cool thing is that if I if at any moment I want to switch I can just press this one button and suddenly I'm an Android baby and now we have an entirely separate l Novo tablet we have a webcam on here and a webcam
shutter something that you typically don't see on a tablet it uses a Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 which is the highest that's currently available in tablets it has 256 gigs of storage in its own right and it has 12 GB of RAM on top of the 32 GB that are already in the laptop now those are not sharable between the two operating systems it's exclusive to this device so instead of say like dual booting or even using a virtual machine you're really literally just running two devices that
combined into a convenient form factor it runs Android 13 and I mean we're talking about the tablet which is also the screen so let's talk about that they have a 2.8k OLED display that runs at 60 HZ clearly being a thin and light they're not really going for the gaming aspect it they don't even tout a GPU you're going to be using your Snapdragon Graphics or your Intel XE integrated graphics on the top of the display is where you get to find your volume buttons you also have on the bottom here
a power button sadly there's no fingerprint reader on this power button or anywhere on this tablet um but it looks like we have Windows facial recognition it looks like you can take advantage of face and lock I don't know if it uses the IR sensors that it will use for Windows hello so it might be less secure than the windows version of the face recognition but again still nice to have some sort of biometric option here and the cameras two 13 megapixel cameras that one is an ultra
wide a 0.6 times Zoom not sure exactly the degree field of view but we can go up to eight times but that's just digital punches that looks nasty um but hey it's a tablet I've never used lenovo's camera software so I'm not going to comment on that but uh I I don't know what AI scan means stop putting the word AI where it doesn't belong Lenovo stupid but now is where things get interesting which is how the heck do we connect to the PC we have two slots on each side that connect onto
these plastic posts and then here is where we have the connection it's a proprietary connector but it is display port as well as we have our charging port and and a data port for USB so if you wanted you could transfer a file via USB cable to your computer but that would be super inconvenient wouldn't it they've actually thought about that and they include a 10 GB hybrid folder so anything they you have saved in the hybrid folder will be saved to both the 256 GB of storage on the tablet as well
as the 1 terab of storage on the laptop itself it's basically doing a advanced kind of copy function and I asked Lenovo about the size it's only a 10 GB folder it's not user adjustable which is a little bit frustrating cuz say you're maybe I don't know transferring movies onto your tablet to watch it would be nice to be able to have like a larger file or if you're shooting 4K video on those 13 megapixel cameras maybe you have a lot of files that you want to transfer at once or have on both it
would be nice to adjust it but I still think it's really cool because look at this I just take this off and I can go to my hybrid folder here and I have the exact same word document look at that it's on both of them when you have the tablet docked you get to take advantage of the touchpad and the keyboard but my windows is being held hostage they also thought of this and it's not the most elegant solution I would have loved to see some sort of like pass through between the two devices but if
we go to Windows we're able to use something called hybrid stream which will open up the Android tablet in a window so that I can use it and you can still use it with a mouse you can still click a text field and type in it it totally captures it as well as even if I move it down here I can still use it as a touchcreen so it's not as good another thing to think about is that this also has its own Bluetooth chip in it it has its own Wi-Fi chip this is the same deal so you can be connected with a
different set of mouse and keyboard to the tablet or here one concern I would have is that maybe you have you were using it in tablet mode with your mouse and keyboard maybe the transfer won't be that easy I imagine Bluetooth has gotten pretty good about multi Point connections that the handoff should happen I guess you would just activate it in Windows um but this is like all these considerations about trying to make two devices talk together it's pretty complex one thing we realize is
that if you turn off your laptop it's not going to turn off both the tablet it will just turn off your laptop so you'll have to remember to turn off both of them however if I press it just to put it to sleep does that put both of them  it I mean it's acting as a single computer now so we should be able to turn it back on we're back now one thing that they want to make sure that you don't do is carry this from the top of it and accidentally lose the Bottom by dropping it you know that would be
tragic you're going to break a nice piece of Hardware so they actually do have a limit if you go too far back your tablet is now locked in so I can pick it up like this um if it's less than that or if it's closed like this I can't pull the top off by accident when I'm trying to shut it closed pretty nice obviously there's still a little bit of software Kinks to work out for them but they got time it's coming out in Q2 of this year and it's going to be retailing for $19.99 they're only going to have the
one skew it's not going to be customizable it's just going to be 32 gigs of RAM with the uh Intel Core i7 Ultra H sorry core Ultra 7 uh the 1 TB Drive the Qualcomm gen 1 plus in there the 256 gigs of storage plus 12 gigs of RAM uh plus the cameras it's a lot "actually for a $2,000 product it's" pretty dang cool you also get the you also get this guy it's a slim and light form factor what you what do you want it's a goodlooking display they definitely got a good looking display
for me what I think is really exciting about this is just there's so many use cases that like we could come up with right like think about this say you're uh somebody who has to do some rendering or you letting a program compile and it's using up a lot of your resources on your laptop you can always just switch to your tablet and then then do other stuff like red documentation or anything else that you need there um it also just gives you the benefit of carrying only one thing if you are somebody who likes
to carry a lot of devices you just have to get your laptop the weight of it surprisingly uh small man this is so cool and while there is two batteries in this technically it's not like the tablet's going to charge your laptop obviously the laptop's going to pass through energy to get to the display and it will charge the tablet so it's not like you get a little bit of extra battery life on the window side in the event that your Windows machine runs out of battery you can switch to your tablet
and still get work done it's pretty smart for me this is the most convincing two in-1 laptop I've seen yet I've always found that folding laptops 180° makes them feel kind of bulky and makes them really hard to use as a tablet but being able to just pull out and have your whole system in here and here solves a all the problems cuz Windows has done this before right the surface lineup involved attaching a whole tablet like I think the original Sur Pro or something was a big tablet all of the
internals were in the back and you'd attach it to like a a headless base that didn't do anything which was a similar idea but it solves the problem of making the bottom be like a useless keyboard it's a whole other machine and the price is fairly reasonable you get two devices and a pen but you know what else is reasonable subscribing to Short Circuit thank you so much for watching uh if you want more CES coverage I don't know maybe this will be the last one that comes out who knows but subscribe
