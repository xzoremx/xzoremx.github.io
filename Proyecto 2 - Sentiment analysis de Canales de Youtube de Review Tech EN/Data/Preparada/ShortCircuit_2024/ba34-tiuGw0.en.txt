14-in gaming laptops are the new hotness and this right here just might be the best one this is the HP Omen transcend 14 and it's oh not how I thought the box was going to open and it's got headphones in the Box here we've got the hyperx cloud 3s and there's actually an integrated wireless dongle inside of the omen transcend 14 so these right here you can pair without having to put in a stupid little take up your USB type A or anything like that that said though this is an optional extra okay laptop can go
over here it in here oh plug in the laptop hit the power button you're good to go for the charger we get this 140 W brick and it is delivering that power over USB type-c which I really appreciate although I also would appreciate if this was just a little bit smaller this is a really heavy Breck all right let's have a look at the main event here ooh now this does come in both black and white and I would really recommend the white one just because look at this look at that
wow they're using the same coating that Razer has meaning that it's just oh my God you touch this thing just for a second and it looks gnarly all right 3.68 lb not too bad or 1.67 kg what is quite decent for a 14-in gaming laptop is the I/O on the right here we have two USB type A's to make sure that the wire always hits your mouse if you're using a wired one on the back we have a USB type-c that has display out and power delivery and HDMI 2.1 that's wired directly to your dedicated graphics card
for extra fpss on the left we have a single Thunderbolt 4 and a headphone microphone combo Jack one thing I am noticing here is they have a lot of heat sink in the back of this it isn't quite like some of those Asus ones that go all the way across but it goes pretty much  across I do have to say this is quite a good looking little laptop it's made out of all aluminum on the chassis it is very very solid I can really Reef on it right here display oh also very so whole laptop's walking instead of that bending
it does really have that r laser blade look although I'm not 100% if I'm sold on the look of the keyboard This has sort of a toy like experience especially once we turn it on but overall I do think they have done a really good job let's do every laptop Maker's favorite test or I just push on the laptop really hard it's it's a little bit soft there on the left of the trackpad that's that's actually quite a bit of deflection it doesn't really matter there keyboard though really stable
everything around the keyboard excellent there's almost no space between these Keys which makes it really nice and smooth you just run your finger across it just like your balls with our sponsor thanks to manscape for sponsoring this video if you're feeling a little overgrown trim your Hedges the manly way with manscapes lawnmower 5.0 Ultra it's trimmer blade and foil blade are interchangeable letting you choose from buzzcut bald to Jeff bezos's bald and to navigate through those more

six performance cores eight efficiency cores and two low power efficiency cores for memory we have 16 GB of ddr5 running at 7467 megga transfers per second so that is wicked fast and also means you definitely cannot upgrade it for an SSD we have a 1 TB Joey from WD Intel WiFi 7 love to see that npu because everybody needs Ai and an RTX 4060 now this does come with up to a 4070 and there's a 4050 available as well and I am a little bit sad that they didn't give us the 4070 model so that we could really
Apples to Apples compare it with the G14 that we have here so maybe in the future we'll look at those side by side but for now we cannot verify hp's claims that this is the best cooled 14-in gaming laptop what we can verify though is that this screen is sick top down it doesn't look nearly as good as it does with my eyeball I am seeing a lot of glare too I can really see my shirt which is surprising cuz it's also very bright this thing right here goes up to 650 nits and that is full screen window
brightness which is just incredible I say this every time that we have OLED in here OLED just looks really freaking good and this is no exception it also goes up to 120 htz and down to 48 although sadly it does not have g-sync it's just doing power saving with dropping the frame rates it's not actually making your games nice and smooth like you would get on the G14 now our Labs did test this display and it's a little bit interesting we weren't able to find any color profiles for it so by
default everything in SDR is pretty oversaturated as it just kind of moves out into the much larger color space that this thing is able to produce but that said if you just whacker into HDR and windows it's great even in SDR content the accuracy is way better when you have Windows and HDR and your HDR content is some of the most accurate we have ever seen on a laptop what might be my least favorite part of this laptop though is the keyboard which is very unfortunate not because it's bad it's
actually absolutely fantastic we'll get said that in a sec but it looks stupid I I I shouldn't say that I shouldn't say that it looks kind of like a toy I thought this was like a $800 laptop and then I actually felt it I was like oh wow that's aluminum those keys are great has an OLED screen oh this is actually really nice it's just unfortunate that that very first thing that you see are these Jelly Bean looking things the good news is though  on it's not my favorite keyboard that
I've ever typed on before a gaming laptop it is excellently tuned you can be wicked fast on these Keys cuz they have a nice low actuation force and you  rip for Pure typing I would give it a very solid a and when you factor in that this is a gaming laptop the lightness of those keys brings it also well it's still an A but I really really like it the trackpad that's below it is also fantastic it's sort of just a trackpad there's nothing standout about it but at the same time it hasn't annoyed me at at
all the tracking is accurate has a nice satisfying click here even if it isn't like a new Force touch fancy thing it does the job before we start gaming I just want to do my PSA of turn off enhanced Point Precision it makes you worse at gaming this right here the 4060 clearly is not the most powerful thing that we have ever had in this office but at the same time it's doing a pretty decent job this laptop is nice and quiet we're able to get 77 FPS in cyber Punk 113 in F1 2023 and 58 in Total War
Warhammer now it is too bad that we aren't able to really compare this cuz this has the 4060 and our other laptops of similar size have 407s but at the  overall all right the whole laptop's vibrating it's kind of [Applause] fun that's pretty solid it gets pretty nice and low I can hear the highs and the mids and the bass all at the same time which is kind of rare on a laptop this seems really quite excellent Omen transcend then all right yeah macbook's way better that's not
surprising the macbook's really good if they had a touchcreen on this I would recommend it over all of the other gaming laptops but what I can recommend though look at that contrast ratio freaking OLED love it the webcam on here is 2.1 megapixels 1080P and also has Windows hello up in there so you can log in with just your face and my face looks really red on this actually and now blown out it's not super well exposed for it looks sharp and I look very shiny I am completely blown out
here and I don't think that my face looks like that at all of course we do have Windows Studio Effects in here because AI so we can blur the background we can have it so I'm always making eye contact with you even though I'm actually not and we can do automatic framing so I can go over here and maybe it yeah it zooms in on me just like that so you can see oh wow the colors look kind of correct way over here for some reason okay it seems like it might just really struggle with that light no I'm
out of the light and I still look like a tomato just dark four Phillips head screws later and we can get in and see that absolutely massive Vapor chamber it's still kind of warm they call this The Omen Tempest cooling go and it uh has a fair bit of dust in here actually given how long this thing has existed look at that I guess it's fine because it's gasketed so it's just staying in here instead of going all through your device like it probably would otherwise in here we do have an SSD that is removable and
according to C 31415 he has commented that many times seeing if I can fit a double-sided SSD in there and so let's try it out H okay okay I guess this is a good test because that's what it should be doing just flat like that and then if we take our double-sided SSD Chuck it in here Eco boing not ideal but if you really want to force it you can all right buddy was correct I'll leave this SS here try it in the future now besides the SSD you can upgrade nothing the Wi-Fi card
unaccessible Ram not accessible what is great in here though is the battery in our Labs testing we able to get 10 hours and 2 minutes out of this thing which is absolutely fantastic on a gaming laptop like this especially one with an OLED screen that is that beautiful now if you do fully load it you can get just under an hour of battery life but you probably aren't doing combuster all day so if you have a laptop that you want to just do all of your gaming and going to school
it's nice and light keyboard's great screen's fantastic this is a really good jack of all trades 14-in laptop and what is also pretty good is the price the one that we got right here that came with the headphones these guys right here is "$1,889 although if you don't want the" headphones included this will be $6 $100 it also has been going on sale already so maybe you can get a good little deal on it so overall HP Omen transcend 14 I think it's an absolutely fantastic laptop it is going to struggle a little
bit differentiating itself from the competition but at the same time it's pretty freaking good if you get one but of course it's not as good as you my dear viewers hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day I'll see you later
