this is the sit jooy X1 apparently a gaming chair that has 16 features built in we're going to open it up and see if we can find all 16 and find out which color we even got now I know Colton's normally the one that does chair unboxings on short circuit but I hadn't seen a chair with this many features in this kind of style of shape for a gaming chair looking at the website after hearing it had 16 features I couldn't really figure out what each 16 were even from their own
website that's why I need to investigate  person oh my goodness I am killing so many turtles when I dump this in the ocean oh we got the gray version we didn't get the orange version Bell there's an LT orange I guess this is a short circuit you want to help no I need to prove that I can do Chair unboxings  help here's I think the back rest of it put it on the couch for now I thought these were buttons but it looks like it's just where the end of each fabric piece is joined together I don't really
know how I like that but whatever what matters is how comfy it is and let's get the back on that's a wrong hole do you need help or you no I I can build a chair by myself B listen you're no Colton you'll never be him little bro I quit you're so close oh oh now you missed it no I got one you didn't get two though oh there we go okay assembly Build That Was Easy holy cow Colton says these are hard what are you talking about before I sit in it let's go over some of the features one
feature is it rotates 270째 270 is supposed to be 3/4 of a circle if we look at this it's pointed exactly this way which means when it's done it should  me uh it's pretty close Okay so that's half a feature uh marked off let's do  arms they are in fact adjustable oh and then this is another feature they actually have storage inside the armrest here which there appears to be some stuff we missed future number four S what is this so it is the I guess arm for the cell phone holder in the other armrest here
was oh this is that threein one pillow it counts as a lumbar pillow a head pillow and a blanket that seems kind of cheap to call it a threein one pillow when two of the features are being a pillow oh okay it's got the blanket inside of it it's not great and I don't like that now my pillow is useless because I took my blanket out there was this envelope that unfortunately got kind of squished let's see what's inside here I'm not reading all that little bro that's a lot of text I'm sorry something
labeled SPS adapter I'm assuming that this is for the built-in Bluetooth speaker that's one of the other features of this chair you get to feel The Wubs in your butt we'll give it a little test drive here but I was just about to go plug the base in which connects from this end into a cable that's already installed in the chair but then this this is all you have to run it from the chair so I guess it has to be kind of near the edge of a wall which I feel like would defeat the entire purpose of
being able to swivel around Bluetooth mode sorry what was that oh it wants us to tell you about our sponsor Corsair if you're looking for a case for your new stunningly powerful PC corsair's 3500x has you covered with support for anywhere from mini ITX all the way up to eatx motherboards a wraparound tempered glass aesthetic and room for up to 10 120 m fans your PC will stay cool inside and out plus its removable glass panels make building and upgrades a breeze it even supports reverse connections for a
clean cable-free look so check out the Corsair 3500x at the link down below  here it's a chair it's comfy though I actually don't mind it I feel like it's pushing me really far forward though even though I feel like I'm leaning back the whole chair wants to push me quite forward right now there is adjustable I think feet rest on the side here o there we go never know how to react when I'm did you hear that did that come through on the audio that was terrible sounding okay I thought maybe it was the
sound of like it reaching its Max limit but the motor still trying to push it but I'm hitting the button again it's not going further oh I hit a third button what does this button do uh the other button you push was underglow yeah I guess that's another feature is the underlow all right beside those buttons that we talked about there's a USB C port and a usba a port so yep I can charge my phone it's not doing fast charging slow charging is better for your battery and I guess if you're
sitting in here for an hour or two watching a movie while it's charging that's better but I prefer fast charging so this is kind of a downgrade in my opinion Bluetooth connected thank you I appreciate it well if you're going to sit in here for 2 hours at least you have a built-in speaker let's give it a little test  that is max volume that is really quiet and does not sound good another really big downside it's Bluetooth 2.0 for you kids playing along at home we're currently on 5.4 today yeah that's not
great I would rather honestly have this plugged in and have some  speaker don't know I was trying to give it the the doubt by hearing people speak instead of just music yeah that still sounds like but if you don't like that you know what you can do there's the GPU upgrade the new GPU has 67 this is much louder I feel like because the reason I think it's louder even if to the outside people might not be this is right here in front of my face right the audio is coming from under my butt here and I
feel like it's just being shot across the floor I don't feel like I'm being immersed in my audio with this speaker versus something like this another feature they both out of the 16 features is voice commands apparently it's kind of like a you have to say something beforehand in this case easy control here I am reading mode okay switch to reading mode for you did it do anything okay let's try let's try the gaming one easy control here I am gaming mode okay switch to for
you that was pathetic I'm actually more uncomfortable now than what I was before easy I want to sleep okay s to sleep mode for you what's the difference between open and this easy mode open recliner opening the recliner is it going to go all the way is that all the way it is so what's the difference between open recliner and sleeping I I'm kind of torn by this cuz I don't necessarily mind voice activated items but this is not a good experience that I'm having right now saying such a long thing like easy
control and then whatever you want to say is kind of annoying and based on what we've just tested I did three things and it brought me to this position so I don't understand why there's that many options along with the 270째 we talked about earlier apparently has 30째 of what they're calling swing which feels like a lot more but it's probably about 30째 another feature they have is the material that it's made of it's it features 80% silica gel leather which quote remarkably smooth and soft
texture reminiscent of baby skin that's a terrible sentence but apparently it's abrasion resistant I don't know abrasion resistant babies but we should give it a try can we scratch it with something I've been commanded by  it it's smooth I don't rub my face against babies very often though don't include that in the video for the love of God put the gloves on cuz we're going to give it a cut with a knife toss me it there we go was nice and safe we'll do little classic Jerry rig everything
we'll do just a little bit and then  harder you know what I'm giving it a pretty decent amount oh but oh I think we're starting to see some which apparently it's cat scratch resistant I'm not really sure how strong a cat is my couch is torn apart so let's give it  try you know what there's definitely marks on it but I think if I did that same pressure to any type of fabric or something like that it would have cut the cut the threads and everything and made a much more obvious scratch than
this but you know it's not cut resistant that's for sure next up it also claims it's ink resistant which we'll start with the pen but we brought some other different Sharpies and whiteboard markers to give it a try well that was immediate I is it supposed to be resistant or repellent resistant cuz like oh you know what though it wipes off pretty easy it's still there but I think if you actually took like a wet  rub okay I'm actually kind of impressed with that that pen did pretty well let's
give the Sharpie and the dry erase marker a go here so we'll do a little bit of the dry erase marker and then  Sharpie oh wow I can already tell that it is doing a pretty good job that did pretty good oh whoops I even got some down here there you go I mean sometimes with ink if you let it sit on the surface for a while and then like you notice 12 hours later cuz your kid doodled on it maybe it would be harder to get off but just initially it actually did really well at coming off
pretty easy and besides just being marker and ink resist it's also Easy Clean apparently let's give this one a test all right let's give it a little  though that came off pretty easy if it was on the actual material here but if it's hitting any of the kind of open fabric side you can see that it is starting to kind of hang on a little bit more I don't know if it's staining it but it's not coming off as easy as you  let's just see how easy it is though oh  god well there we go I got all the chip
pieces out but you can still slightly see a little bit of red from the ketchup on like this flowery part here but the rest of the chair cleaned up fine it's just those exposed Fabrics all right Belle that one did pretty well what's   wait 10 years later still looks pretty good now to the most important feature flame retardant you you got to get off the chair what no it'll be fine if it bursts into flames it's not going to burst into flames what if it does then it's good
content I don't even know I got to look up how to use this bill is on standby with the flamethrower or the okay we'll do we we we'll start with  up you know what though this definitely gets hotter than like a typical Bick lighter for example and it held up pretty well for the second and then obviously because this is way warmer you can see just the tiniest bit of damage there but I think for most household lighters it would probably be okay we're going to try from a bit further away and
then we'll move closer cuz again of the  but if you're holding that fire on that long there's other issues I think so honestly I think it did pretty well if someone just accidentally bumped a lighter or something I think it's totally fine Andrew a cameraman here actually pointed another thing you're not always necessarily worried about fire if this is up against a wall with a baseboard heater or something and over time it slowly Heats it up that can also cause fire and in that case I think this 
God nice gotcha the next two features are weightlessness and it's filling which is 50% fiber and 50% feathers overall it's pretty comfy to sit in but Andrew actually pointed out earlier it doesn't look like it kind of hugs you I feel like I'm sitting on top of the chair and I think that's a pretty accurate representation of how I feel unless I do this then I'm like being held into place you know so would I recommend this chair based on the 16 features I don't know on sale we saw it
as low as $700 but the retail price is "$1,200 depending on what other shops" you're looking for a recliner $700 can be an appropriate price for one and they "can go all the way up to $1,200 it will" come down to if you feel the need to have a dedicated cell phone holder or this type of reclining or the voice activation but what I want this in my home I'm not even going to try for it at the Christmas party cuz I've burnt it and put ink on it but if you guys did enjoy this video make sure you guys like
it down below leave a comment on what you think about the chair and maybe go check out any of our other chair videos unless I burn them
