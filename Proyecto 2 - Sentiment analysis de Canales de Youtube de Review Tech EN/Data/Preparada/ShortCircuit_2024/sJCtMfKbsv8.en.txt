new graphics cards used to be exciting but now we've got supers and XTS and it's hard to know if they're any good especially when the stack is now huge and the price to Performance is not always what you want it to be AMD has come out with their new 7600 XT and we've got power colors hellhound Edition which is actually pretty cool it is a pretty badass looking box I'm not going to lie it reminds me of the old school days when there used to be like anime girls and weird ass aliens and stuff on
the boxes and on the cards those were great the RX 76 XT has some pretty cool things going for it like 16 gigs of vram and 100 more megahertz on the clock and that's it that's like literally all it's got going for it we've got 32 compute units 64 AI accelerators 32 Ray accelerators  trying a little bit here overall while this is an interesting release it's kind of disappointing because we have been given something that we've all been clamoring for a year later but nothing
else and I just can't help but wonder if they couldn't have done a better job at the price that they're releasing this at what's cool about the hellhound Edition is it's got a little OC vers silent bios you can swap that to whatever you want I'm going switch it back to OC because uh let's be real this thing isn't going to get that loud when playing games and then on top of that it's also got an LED switch I'm going to make sure that is set to on when I plug it in later cuz I
want to see how good the RGB is if it's RGB at all it's two slot card nice and slim which is great these days considering how chunky everything's getting we've got what looks like three  2.1singles HDMI but at least AMD is giving us DP 2.1 not that this thing is going to take advantage of uh hbr1 or anything like that they adverti that it's going to draw about 190 Watts but we did see spikes of up to 230 or 240 Watts under extreme heavy loads now that's fine they're recommending a 600 W
power supply so even if you have a generally beefy CPU you should be okay let's take a look at the size for test comparisons we went with an arc a770 cuz it's a little cheaper and also has 16 gigs of vram and a 4060 Ti from Nvidia for a mid-range card this is about the size I'd expect I'm actually still running a 1660ti in my stream computer and uh it's about the same size little dual slot two fan card that doesn't take up a lot of space fits in most form factor PCS our Arc card is what another
like 30 mm or something it's nothing to scoff at the last thing you want to do is buy a card take it home and then not be able to fit it in your computer I really do like how Sleek these a770 looking feel though not going to lie well that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about the RX 7600 XT and I kind of like this one too uh the hellhound Edition is pretty dope with these cool see-through fans I'm guessing that these are going to light up I'm really hoping that they're going to
light up because that would look absolutely sick otherwise it's pretty bog standard in terms of card height these days as well as uh all of your other dimensions now the 4060 TI 16 gig and the RX 7600 XT are both on a 100 128bit bus the ark a770 is on 256 so if you like that little bit of extra memory bandwidth then there's kind of a clear winner here but how does that translate to actual performance we'll find out after a message from our sponsor Jawa they make getting rid of your old
graphics card Easy by just buying it off you themselves all you have to do is go through the steps on their site to get an instant quote and a free shipping label most sellers will get paid within one business day after jaware receives the part and if you're looking to upgrade your graphics card you can find big savings on their Marketplace of cards from users just like you each card is carefully inspected and quality checked to make sure they're in working condition and it's not just graphics
cards Jawa makes it easy to sell your old rig or buy one from an experienced Builder sell your old card the easy way and offset the cost of a new one by checking out the link in the description below all right that was easy thanks to no 16 pin power connector just an 8 and a six pin nice and simple for a three lighting modes we've got ice blue off if you don't want any colors or purple purple I really like the purple that's definitely for me we're going to stick to that cyberpunk 1080p FSR turned off
so it's all Native we are getting 100 frames per second which is actually not too bad but you know what it could be better FMF is basically just amd's answer to nvidia's frame generation so we're going to enable FMF and instantly oh my gosh 180 frames a second it's not quite doubling but that is an enormous leap it's hard to say if I'm actually seeing any weird artifacting or anything that isn't just kind of already in cyberpunk but even quickly flicking around like this icon here isn't
doing that same kind of artifacting that early frame generation had let's see what it can do if we up the resolution for down to like 60 on average 63 61 okay not great it's definitely still playable let me turn on FSR gets a little better with FSR but it's still not great 88 90 frames a second and now I can really start to see some just kind of grow actually FSR is not terrible feel like it's gotten better it's also a little unfair we're using a 4K screen that's pretty big and scaling it down
just isn't quite what we should be doing so it plays games but how well let's talk performance in 1080P atomic heart obviously loses to our 16 gig 4060 TI but it does slightly better than the Arc a770 in the 1% lows and moving up to 1440p we see basically the same thing in cyberpunk at 1080p our Ark a770 loses once more but this time the averages is quite Stark despite our 1% lows being almost the same in cyberpunk at 1440p our RTX 460 TI actually really starts to lose ground here the 7600 XT actually
beats it in 1% lows by 1 FPS and loses and averages by only three moving on to F1 2023 at 1080p our Arc card really starts to struggle here losing 28% performance compared against our 7600 XT the race also gets a little tighter between our 460 TI in the 7600 XT with only a 10 FPS difference in our 1% lows what it really boils down to is price to Performance this card costs $330 and the reality is while it has fewer gigs of vram at only 12 gigs instead of 16 a 6700 XT can be bought
both brand new or or used for about the same price as this card maybe even cheaper than that so unfortunately it's just kind of a failure and I don't really understand why you'd buy a 7600 XT when unlike Nvidia where they're kind of gaing frame gen and dlss 3.0 behind the 40 series cards AMD is not doing that the 6000 series can do it too so I don't get it it took them a year to come out with this and it's it's just kind of a non-starter I don't see the point in getting one and uh frankly I'm a little
disappointed there are some minor benefits if you're into machine learning or maybe if you just really need that 16 gigs of vram for video editing or something along those lines and you can't afford a 4060 TI maybe you get this guy but even then I'm kind of leaning towards Intel and going with an arc a770 for also around the same price as this overall it's just kind of a bad time to be a budget gamer the cards on the low end from everyone just aren't performing the way they used to thanks
for watching short circuit if you want to check out another video card check out the 4070 super that's kind of doing better but it costs a lot more money
