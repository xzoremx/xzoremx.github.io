for years alien wear's laptops have been absolutely insane out of this world machines that are insanely fast that you maybe don't actually want cuz using them in real life kind of sucked well hopefully they're going to change that here today cuz we have the new M16 R2 that promises to be kind of practical but first let's have a look at the power adapter to see just how fast this might be you're looking at 240 WS which is being delivered over a barrel Jack now at that kind of a wattage it is pretty
difficult to get it over USB type-c so I will accept the barrel Jack but it's still not my favorite cuz this is a massive power adapter is there anything else in here we got a little manual do we have any stickers oh stickers heck yeah so here we have the new M16 and it is looking pretty good it actually looks a lot like Dell's gaming laptops like G3 G5 that kind of more budget stuff but this is definitely a bit more premium how heavy is this it feels pretty like given that I know
there's a 4070 in here one sec 5.4 lb that's pretty heavy but not too bad given that it's a gaming laptop and with the charger we're up to O nearly 6.9 for context that's a total carry weight just over 3 Kg looking at the iio it is quite solid on the right side we have a micro SD card reader and two type A ports that are in the exact correct spot to make sure that if you have a Wired Mouse it runs straight into the wire right there very bad placement but I'm glad that they have them we also
have Thunderbolt 4 USB type-c that connects directly to the dgpu HDMI 2.1 our power input right there on the left side we have headphone microphone combo Jack and 2.5 GB land which I really like to see looking at the design overall the materials are quite premium although it does kind of look like a laptop from like 3 4 years ago this really isn't giving me designed in 2023 Vibes but that said look at the size of this trackpad it is Tiny compared to the amount of space that they could have
used if they really wanted to go for it for comparison here is the origin laptop that we use for screen recording on our short circuit set it is a slightly larger laptop but just look at the size difference of those track pads it is complete night and day looking at the design overall again it is very reserved but it is very high quality as you can see there's very little Flex around the keyboard it's very well built we also can see where all of the cooling is going so there's a
whole bunch of vents here vents on the sides and vents on the back back so I believe it's sucking in from the bottom and blowing out there and there and there and there and it's really loud at the moment what are you doing overdrive button Works confirm that and we also confirmed the segue to our sponsor thanks to updf for sponsoring this video updf is your ultimate AI PDF assistant powered by GPT 40 whether you're on Windows Mac iPad iOS or Android updf makes editing annotating OCR siding

bright although it is a matte display so Props for that alien wear it gets up to 375 nits as tested by our Labs which means it's fine enough indoors I have it maxed right now and it's acceptable enough but at the same time you try and take this outside not going to happen you are not going to see a thing and that is compounded by the gamma leaning a little bit towards the darker end so things that are black are going to be more blacker on here so you're dark areas might be not quite as bright as
you would expect that said though the color accuracy of this panel is absolutely fantastic it covers 100% of srgb although it only covers srgb you don't get a wider color space than that we measured an average Delta e2000 of 1.42 which is absolutely fantastic you expect less than two to do professional color work so as long as you don't need the wider color spaces like d C ip3 or adobe RGB you can very much trust this display now in the future we are going to be changing our measurements a little
bit to Delta e ITP which is a better way of measuring the colors on a display and this right here as our first one gets an average Delta e ITP of 6.54 which is again really good it's not quite as good as like a Macbook in reference display mode but you know what a Macbook can't do display 240 FPS straight to your eyeballs that's right this thing right here has a 240 HZ panel and 1600p so that's like 1440p but a 16 by10 Edition which is just fantastic because I really love that even gaming laptops
like this have those slightly taller displays because it just it makes more sense for the size of a laptop and also it's just so much better for professional applications browsing the web that sort of stuff what also is great are the specs of this thing so we have the Intel core Ultra 7 155h if you really want it you can go up to the ultra 9 but I suspect that's not going to be getting you a whole lot more performance we also have 16 GB of RAM running at 5600 megat transfers per
second ooh and it says the form factor is sodm which is very exciting this might actually be upgradeable we also have a Samsung nvme SSD that is 1 tbte and also apparently you can set this up in raid Zero from the factory if you just want things to be really fast and not very reliable we also have Intel WiFi 7 on board we also have an Nvidia RTX 470 that is the top speec of this and you might know that the R1 version of this came with up to an RTX 490 which means that the new one is slower but as
we said at the start that is because they were able to make this chassis way smaller than the old one and most people just weren't buying over a 4070 anyway also in here we have the npu with our Intel processor which we now know is not powerful enough to do most of the AI things that come with Microsoft co-pilot so uh it's useless all right let's play some games now uh I did just launch rocket league and as you can hear it's really flipping loud now one interesting thing that our Labs noted is that even
if you're in like balanced mode or quiet mode or whatever if it's plugged in and you turn on a game it automatically goes to Performance performance mode which is why is this 100% GPU fan speed you can see this right here the GPU is at 50° C it does not need to be at 100% fan speed balanced maybe quiet down please all right it appears that we have gained 2° oh maybe three on the GPU and we now cannot hear the fans excellent tuning D all right this is not a very heavy game
but we are seeing 250 to 300 FPS that's pretty darn good and especially with this 240 HZ display I imagine this is going to be a pretty good time if I'm honest I was planning on kind of complaining about this display cuz if you look at it compared to like most of what other gaming laptops have now which is like oleds and stuff like that it didn't sound like it would be too good but now that I'm seeing it in game this is excellent for gaming you don't necessarily need like the darkest blacks
or the most contrast for a game cuz sometimes that can be not even as good if what you want to see is kind of dark on your display we have confirmed that this gaming laptop is much powerful enough to play this let's head out just changed over performance mode again switch to Performance preset no change settings all right we can disable it we can go in the software we can flip a switch and then it doesn't automatically go to Performance mode which I quite appreciate if you are playing a game and
it seems like things are heating up a little bit too much you can just press this button right here boom high performance mode enabled there we go from most part I don't want that we can just very simply have it be in Balan mode and everything will be happy this does also have Nvidia Advanced Optimus so you have gsync in there of course and we also have a direct line from the GPU directly to your display so it can get a little bit confused at times but for the most part that means that you're going to
have an extra 10 or so FPS compared to if it had to put those frames through your igpu first to get into this display yeah we're in valheim here and we're looking at 75 FPS highest possible "details that's at, 1600p of course our" lab also put it through the paces so we're looking at 104 FPS in cyberpunk 2077 159 FPS in F1 2023 and 80 FPS in Total War Warhammer 3 and that is coming out of the 140 wat 470 in this model of the M16 that we have right here now that was able to beat the Asus sephus G14
which is good cuz this is a much larger laptop although it wasn't able to quite match the Rog strix g16 which you'd think would be pretty similar at 140 W TDP on the GPU as well but maybe they're able to just stretch their CPUs legs a little bit more either way this is a pretty freaking fast laptop even if it is quite loud in that performance mode but loads of gaming performance is no good to you if the keyboard is trash fortunately though this one feels excellent yeah this keyboard is
fantastic I'm going to give it just a solid a there is loads of consistency between the keys there is heaps of travel look at that they feel really good they have a nice tactile bump at the top they don't bottom out in any sort of a weird way there's enough chassis rigidity that they are just working really quite well now I will briefly complain about the trackpad it's overall pretty good the tracking solid I haven't had any problems with it like right clicking when I meant to left
click or stuff like that I just wish there was more of it like I said before there's quite a bit of space here that they definitely could have put a trackpad into and it kind of seems like they just reused the old one from the laptop that had all of that extra space for fans and crap on the back and all of this was moved down but instead they just didn't bother making a new one for this gen which is kind of disappointing especially given that this is not a cheap laptop it's passible I am going to
accept the size of the trackpad just simply because Alienware did such a good job on this keyboard so I will be okay maybe plugging in a mouse every now and then if I need to if it does mean that I can comfortably type on this keyboard for hours and hours but can I comfortably listen to music 4  tiny wow there's there's not a lot going on there it's loud but there's no base whatsoever compared to the speakers that I've been hearing on other laptops like those from Asus and Razer and HP these
do not match up to what they have been able to achieve and it's especially disappointing cuz Dell on their XPS line has really f fantastic speakers and it's kind of sad that that technology wasn't able to make it over here J's probably also really disappointing given Dell's streak the webcam we do have a 1080p webcam here and it looks okay I guess I look really blocky and kind of blotchy and overall just not particularly flattered by what I am seeing but at the same time it's not
doing anything egregiously wrong it's exposing for my face as well as I can even though it's kind of completely blown out right there it's so grainy and overall trash looking that wa look at those Halos whenever I move it the like the image stays for a second I would say that webcam is perfectly acceptable even though not good at all hopefully the Qualcomm laptops that are coming out now will just blow this out of the water or they do I can tell you that for sure one thing that is very nice about this
camera though is that there's IR sensors up here so you can use Windows hello facial recognition to get into your laptop which is my personal favorite way to get into a laptop one thing I have been noticing though is that it's getting really warm around this it has the exhausts on the side that are blowing out this way and the area on the M pad even though we haven't been gaming for a while is really hot these are kicking out a lot of heat and I imagine if you to play games for half an hour an
hour or so your hand over here is going to be getting very toasty especially if you're gaming in the summer so note that eight Phillips head screws later and we are in and I am quite impressed so many laptops these days do not have upgradeable RAM and I love to see that Alienware has kept on including that here even in their mline which is you know supposed to be a little bit thinner and lighter this rate here huge bonus for me so we only have 16 GB of RAM in our model here if you need more in the
future just put in more you can just do it super easy to do this I absolutely love to see that kind of upgradeability and it moves this laptop up a couple of places for me personally also if you want to put in a second SSD you can do so right here if you did insc one from the factory and if for whatever reason Wi-Fi 7 doesn't work in a couple years well you can just replace your Wi-Fi card as well so that is about as good of upgradeability as we can expect expect from a laptop like this so good job guys
also looking at the heat sink here it's nothing too crazy we don't have a massive Vapor chamber we just have a couple of heat pipes going to our vents on the back and on the sides we've got two fans that are just pretty typical fans for your laptop but the star of this show here besides our SOA memory is the 90w hour battery now this being a gaming laptop it's not the most efficient in the world but we were still able to get over 7 and 1/2 hours in our battery life endurance test which is
pretty good for a laptop like this something like the Asus G14 does beat it pretty much every ryzen gaming laptop does beat it actually but for an Intel gaming laptop it is really quite good I feel like it's very rare these days that a computer manufacturer manages to just make something that overall is solid there's nothing about it that blew me away I wasn't like oh an OLED screen wow what if the same time there's nothing really bad about it like I can wish for a slightly larger trackpad but that's
not a deal breaker for sure and the keyboard more than makes up for it so I quite like it this model that we have right here with 16 GB of RAM terab of memory and that 470 comes in at $1900 so it is definitely a bit expensive but it is also quite in line with everyone else and in particular if you can find one of these on sale I would jump on it just like I'm going to jump jump onto the end of this video hit like get subscribed and just have a great all day see you later Labs just
asked if I want to talk about the max "spec version that's 3,800 bucks I don't" that's stupid don't buy that one just upgrade it yourself
