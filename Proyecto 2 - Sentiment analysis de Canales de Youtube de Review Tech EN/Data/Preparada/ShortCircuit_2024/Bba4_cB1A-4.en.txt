wish has loads of really weird Soundbars and Bluetooth speakers and everything like that and I think we found a really weird looking cool one today by Sai S I I don't know I don't know this is the the sh39 and let's find if it's an sh1t I don't know did it get broken in shipping it's all like bent this has an 18800 R curve which would fit in front of a curved monitor I I'm not sure I've seen that before which is kind of neat we found the thing on wish and it is a gaming speaker bluetooth 5.0 Soundbar
computer audio desktop subwoofer 3D surround desktop clock you get USB micro b that's cool haven't seen one of those in years's an ox cord for only my phone these days stereo ox cord and manual all in forign at first I thought the top was all super scratched but it's actually got this awesome peel on it so shall we do that  okay I have a pretty bad hate of piano black how about mirrored that sounds better yeah that's keep a microfiber cloth near this first impressions it's kind of
interesting that it's curved uh I haven't really seen that before from anybody which is kind of interesting even razor I could expect some sort of curve it looks like it's got all these switches on the front and these are actually like mechanical keyboard switches I can see them they're like a cherry blue or something actually yeah there you go look at that that's ridiculous looks like we've got some nice pads on the bottom to keep it from sliding around and on the back here we
have a lot of weird and wonderful ports got USB 5vt in from that micro b our ox cord our microphone input which is also kind of interesting I thought it had one built in but it's just got an input for one and the last one is a Micro SD card slot it doesn't feel super heavy but but it doesn't also feel super light either it's plasticky but it kind of feels quite sturdy which is good uh there is a battery in here it is a battery powered Bluetooth speaker this doesn't seem to
turn on so I'm going to give it a charge while you listen to our sponsor drop and there cstm 810 keyless keyboard with a plethora of customization options including a decorative top case that fits magnetically onto the bottom case giving you the ability to choose from multiple colors for your keyboard you can also pick up different keyboard weights and switch plates to tailor your typing experience and of it features hot swappable switches RGB and supports qmk via and vile so learn more about the
drop cstm 80 at the link down in the description I've had it on charge for a bit here so let's turn it on see what happens oh there we go yeah me too okay that's not a color that's a that's a thermometer so they didn't even list that on the website so it's got It's got thermometer what about this one this one's lighting look at  we have a power button we've got our mode button which I guess changes it between the various inputs on the back we've got a couple alarms which is
interesting we can set the clock next up we have a temperature display so it'll show you the current temperature it's currently 26 uh we've got volume adjustment the button in the center here is called the game button doesn't do anything I don't know we've got some transport controls here and on the last one we've got lighting control which is kind of neat it's cool that it's got a dedicated game button but let's listen to some music and see how bad it actually  sounds well I guess it sounds kind of
okay that is max volume so it doesn't get super loud yeah I was wondering why there was four speakers when the kind of the website only said there was two uh these two on the outside I believe are fake they were moving around from kind of some of the base reflex but yeah they're not producing any sound even touching them is like there's nothing there it actually sounds pretty okay for a what it's like a $60 speaker or something like that well it seems to perform at music fine but it's for
gaming so let's try for gaming you only need two speakers for gaming we brought in a curved Monitor and yeah it's a "1,800 R which is kind of neat it it fits" the curve there's the mode switch button which switches between your Bluetooth and your radio and things like that and the gaming button actually just switches it to like the USB input which is kind of interesting so it's going to charge it and also hook it up to your computer it would have been really neat if there
was some passrs on the bottom so that I could put my you know keyboard cable under there or I don't know if they just assume all your peripherals are going to be Bluetooth so now I got all these wires everywhere in this ones at the top the volume is controlled separately from the computer so I have this at 100% it makes a horrible beep when you get to maximum volume oh boy that sounds bad it's a little crunchy to be perfectly honest it's not really that Punchy and I'm not really getting a good stereo
effect either let's try it in Bluetooth mode cuz it kind of sounded a bit better in Bluetooth mode well this is this is going  it oh my God so you can be connected to Bluetooth and the computer simultaneously like maybe that's the  care can I can I give up now I I don't know it connected to the computer okay with the USB the Bluetooth I don't know if that's it or it was fine on my phone uh this is kind of the problem with buying little things in questionable Tech off of uh wish or AliExpress or any
of the other websites on the internet uh it doesn't even have four speakers the keys that are made of mechanical are actually really neat I would love to see that on more products I think that's cool uh yeah I don't know show yeah me too thanks so much for watching if you like this check out some of the other Bluetooth speakers that I've had a look at which might actually be worth the money
