is this even real I remember getting the message about this and being like but actually I kind of like it and if you're wondering what I'm referencing this this seemingly ordinary network switch to the 24 Port ubiquity switch has RGB and not just like it has lights every single one of these RJ45 ports has RGB lighting for why because why not that's exactly why but also so you can like show what devices are in there and what's connected but damn it sounds so cool we've got standard ubiquity
accessory package here crack that open Hardware kit that's going to be your rack ear thingies this is the fancy locking cable that they seem to be including on most of their switches these days and then there are the little rack ears I'm expecting in here that this is going to  much the same as previous ubiquity switches I I don't think you're going to be able to see I mean I don't know I haven't really looked at it that closely let's see maybe you can tell that they're different I guess it's
got to be transparent in some capacity what oh yeah oh yeah you see in there you see how it's white in the back you can see that right this is an Enterprise xg4 oh yeah it's black in the back because RGB before we continue much further I should probably introduce this switch this is the new Pro Max 24 Poe part of their new Pro Max lineup just like the iPhone yep it's almost like the CEO used to work at Apple or something you can see right there it even says usw prom Max I'm going to be honest I
feel like ubiquity lineup is getting a little bit confusing you have like the old switches which are listed as like in Brackets gen one on their website you have the pro series you have Enterprise you have Pro Max now you have I think what else is there there's got to be more oh there's even standard I forgot about the standard ones there's so many freaking switches there's even aggregation which is confusing because one of the aggregations is a pro aggregation and the other is just an
aggregation is that one a standard product line item and that one a pro product line item I don't know the point I'm trying to get across here is I'm just confused I'm going to put that aside for now and just focus on the things we do understand like what kind of ports are on this switch we have eight Poe plus ports over here these just run at gigabit we've got another eight Poe plus plus ports so those are you know a fair bit of wattage compared to these and then we have poe+ plus 2.5
gig which is something I've been wanting to see on a ubiquity switch for a while now and the reason for that is we have 2.5 gig U6 Enterprise access points so if I want to run those at 2.5 gig and also have Poe Plus+ I have to do that on two different switches at least up until now and then over here we' got two 10 gig ports pretty standard on a switch of this tier I like that compared to some of previous 24 Port Poe switches all of the ports are in a single line like this
so if for using little cables to go into a patch panel that's the next rack unit up you don't have to like run cables like they just go one one one one one nice and smooth which makes sense because it seems like a big part of this switch is well looks given the RGB we're going to turn that on soon we got their standard screen over there I'll rip the little sticker off and around back we've got the AC power port that's the Locking style I mentioned earlier and then this guy which is like a DC power in that
they use with their redundant power setup I really wish I would stop seeing this and just give me just give me two of these two power supplies on the Enterprise line Maybe please let's turn the bloody thing on but not before I tell you about today's sponsor pulseway which is perfect because we're talking about networking and managing your networking and your it including your RGB Network switches shouldn't be a headache and pulseway wants to make running important actions on your
systems much easier they're a mobile first platform because you should be free to live your life and use it from anywhere and pulseway lets you monitor manage and troubleshoot those systems from the comfort of your home on your phone it integrates smoothie Le slack Bit Defender zenes and more so experience system management without being tied to your desk by checking out a free trial of pulseway at the link down below got the little UniFi Express um it's it's a Gateway and an AP in
one and then our XG 24 we're wired up to ethernet so oh wait did it do a thing oh it's doing things that's so cool it's it's not going to make your your games run faster your downloads go faster or your network more stable unless I guess you had like a really bad switch before but there is some utility to this it's not just a looks cool gimmick imagine you had a rack full of switches and you're like damn where is that device and you could just click on the port and go blink I mean yeah you can blink a
switch Port normally but imagine all of the other switches are blinking right well now there's a second light that's a lot bigger and more obvious or you have you know a poop mix of like I got APS spread across and I've got you know access controls spread across all of these you know hundreds of ports you can have them color coded so say your APS are set to purple and your access control is set to yellow and then normal devices are set to black or what about this hey VLAN configuration oh that Port
set to the security VLAN it's just an easy visual thing and to ubiquity point there was a lot of people just being like ha that's a stupid gimmick but like who cares it's it's just a bonus feature the problem with this product it's not really their fault and I don't really know that there was a way around it if you have normal ethernet cables like this one that are blue have a blue boot you can't see this one's not so bad because it's clear on this end um I did try to find a
cable oh yeah here this is actually one of ubiquity own patch cables so uh talk about thinking ahead hey so you plug that one in you actually you can't see anything yeah well okay you can you can but it's definitely not as cool as this one where it's fully transparent and you can see through so if you're thinking about buying one of these switches cuz you like RGB consider the fact that you might have to replace literally all of your cables while this is a transparent one that works decently well it's not
the most optimal ubiquity sells specific ether lighting cables which is what they're calling this RGB system that are translucent so they kind kind of catch some of the light and diffuse it that's going to give you the best effect for sure these ones actually look okay because I just see it kind of bouncing off and this one actually is the hardest to see oh but also studio lights can we can we um we can turn off can we turn them off for a second oh it looks pretty cool man it's not useless if you don't
have the special cables but it is definitely not as good as long as you don't have patch cables that are are one 100% opaque it's interesting that the default is just strobing white you notice the uh the port LEDs aren't on you see how there's LEDs up here to like indicate a connection they're off down here are any of them on I'm I'm very curious to see what options it gives you for like automatic colors like for an lacp link if you had you know a few cables that were see had four cables
that were in an aggregate link you could just be like I want those ones to be green and then the other aggregate link those ones are purple you know there's lots of different ways to skin this cat that's such a horrible saying there are also three other switches in the lineup a 48 port a 48 port with Poe and a 24 Port that isn't Poe we'll show their specs on the screen somewhere here you go come on turn on for hey oh my God why are those ones blue okay the coloring right now I'm
looking at am I screen recording I'm screen recording the coloring I'm I'm seeing right now seems to correspond with the fact that they're 2.5 gig it's matching what is shown here if I go to settings I have two options neither of them are selected I can do speed or network and I can set brightness colors default let's try green oh yeah there we go that is not the green I selected maybe not the highest CRI LEDs  purple hey okay that looks pretty cool you know what I want to
see what does it look like with the wrong cables much less cool with not the right cables transparent cables much better all right I can do speed too okay if I switch to speed this is cool you can set the color of each speed you see that they added RGB to that Port good job ubiquity okay let's see hey look at that that's pretty responsive now can I set a specific port to a color I was kind of expecting more customizability I'm not going to lie in the present State it's pretty basic you
can set it based on your VLAN like your native untagged Network or you can set it based on speed what I was talking about before about changing the port color to be based on the type of device that's connected doesn't seem to be a thing it's only Network and speed and I can't also just like go in and say I want this one to be that color okay that's locate right there that's pretty helpful if you had a rack full of switches and you're not really sure which one is which and you were just like ah show me that
one that's pretty good it would be cool if you have like 10 of these switches and you did this it shut all of them off and just blink to the one I don't have another switch to test that but if that's not the functionality they should they should change that I feel like it's probably just that it's early stages and more of these kind of ideas and features will get added later on to make this more useful it's got most of the usefulness so far by device type would be nice and being able to just like
paint colors as I want would also be cool maybe I have certain things plugged in that it wouldn't recognize as a device type like say I don't know I have these ones are computers and these ones are wall ports and whatever and I want to color it myself it would be good to be able to do that if I pick the closest other switch they have feature wise the pro 24 Poe which has been around for a while they're both layer 3 capable have 400 WS of power output have the same amount of ports
they both have the 10 gigs here and then 24 other ports it's a $1 more for this one but you're also getting 2.5 gig on eight of the ports that's pretty much oh yeah you also get more Poe Plus+ ports although you don't necessarily have more power budget to use it per se it doesn't seem to be ridiculously more expensive or anything I mean $100 I could easily see a network vendor charging just for the fact that it has 8 2.5 gig ports like I I could totally see that but overall I mean it's
cool they should just put this on all of the switches as long as it doesn't really increase the price um hopefully we can get translucent cables that work good with it from other vendors for less money and hopefully they make the software more flexible I really want to be able to just like paint them any color I want or set it by device or adjust the effect maybe I just want my switch to be like rainbow they have that in the product photo you know when you adopted it it was like rainbow what why
doesn't it do that I don't know what happened oh my God thank you ah I updated to the next version which is like 0 too higher and now I can turn off breathing mode this looks way better like this I probably wait a few more months and see what sort of features they enable but it's cool and just props to ubiquity for trying to do something a little bit different in a market segment that just like doesn't change at all like oh the there's faster ports woo so if you like this video and other
