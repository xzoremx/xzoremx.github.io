it's a sad day the XPS 15 that I loved so dearly Dell's killing and it's not the only one too the XPS 17 the 13 the 132 and one all dead because they've got some brand new laptops right here at CES 2024 here in Vancouver we have the XPS 13 plus which isn't new but it's the 13 now the 14 the 16 but what I want to show you first because they have somehow improved a laptop and made it make more sense in a new gener ation it's the Alienware M16 over the last while I haven't been totally sure what Alienware
has been doing cuz they have just been chasing the maximum performance without really thinking about can your laptop fit in your bag but here they have look at the size difference between the old M16 and the new one that is the difference between a fitting in your backpack or not in a very strange twist this brand new Alienware M6 16 will actually be slower than the outgoing model so this right here gets up to a 4070 whereas the old one got up to a 4090 but what they have done with that
drop in power and thermal requirements is make just a laptop you actually want to use there's just so much usability about this new laptop that just makes so much sense like look at this right here on the old one the Palm rest put my hands here and they're just falling off of The Edge it is not comfortable to type for a while even though they have some of the best switches in the game whereas Now new one wow look at that my hands are comfortable or maybe you're going into a business meeting or
something like that and you don't want to be all gamified watch this right here one button there we go stealth mode wow it almost looks like an old gen XPS look at that now I did say we have less power than last gen but that does not mean this thing is slow by any means we have a total of 175 wat system power and that 4070 can gobble down a whole 1402 itself for the CPU we get an Intel Core 9 185h and we also have quite a decent selection of iio so on this side right here we have 2.5 gig networking
headphone microphone combo Jack can't take that for granted power input here HDMI 2.1 display port this one right here uses Optimus to be wired directly to the GPU Thunderbolt 4 and then two type A's rate where uh if you plug in a mouse it'll get in your way that's too bad and an SD card reader it is the micro one so that's a little bit smaller than the last gen but they say this is the fastest micro SD card reader that you can put in the laptop so don't complain too much opening up the new M16
is nice and easy as it was in the past just a couple Phillips head screws and you are in and in here we can see that well uh you had a fair bit less stuff than the old one so the old one had four fans seven heat pipes now we are down to two fans and four heat pipes but they said these fans are quite a bit larger which uh yeah the fan is quite a bit bigger so they now have 94 fan blades here up from 79 in the old model which is how they can get away with not quite as many heat pipes and that is how they
have been able to maintain good thermal performance in this right here also we still have excellent upgrade ability so two sodm right there two ssds right here your Wi-Fi card there and we have a 90w battery that is hopefully going to be getting you quite a bit of time away from the wall there we goh she's all good just like the display options in keeping with just kind of giving you what you want there is only a single option and it is the best option Quad HD 16x 10 240 HZ that's well exactly what I
want on a gaming display and a laptop just like I want to tell you about our sponsor thanks to be quiet for sponsoring a c s 2024 coverage if you're shopping for your next PC build or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet their premium products include PC cases power supplies Water and Air Cooling and fans for desktop PCS with roots in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are nearly

right here it looks well it looks a lot like the 13 plus that we had before but it doesn't have a lot of the drawback so one of the things right here that I did not like about the 13 plus put your hands on here Edge super sharp and your hands are hanging off of the back 14 though look at this it's nice and comfy another thing that's not so great about the 13 plus is that uh no headphone jack but look at this right here we've got a headphone jack and the rest of the I/O is pretty
good too now we no longer have a fullsize SD card reader but this little micro SD card reader like the Alienware they say is a fast as they could get it Thunderbolt 4 Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 4 but very interestingly even though the I/O appears to be the same on the 16 in this guy right here is special well it's only special on the 470 version but this will allow you to do Nvidia Optimus directly to your display from this one right here if you get the 40/50 or the 4060 or the Intel
Ark you will not be getting that that'll just be Thunderbolt 4 and also the 4070 version of this will come with a vapor chamber whereas the other ones will be just coming with heat pipes and that reduces your total TDP by 10 wats and uh speaking of that yeah this right here gets a 4070 in it in this little guy right here and it isn't even one of those ply little barely a 4070 ones it gets 60 watts for the GPU the whole system can draw up to 80 at a time which means you should actually be able to
game half decent on this for the CPU we get up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185h in the 16 in the 14 we get up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 or 7 165h this guy can also go up to an RTX 4050 for the RTX 4050 in the 14 we get up to 30 wats on that 30 wats on the CPU and 47 Watts total which means that even though it won't be the most powerful I still think you'll be able to game pretty good in particular because of the display all of these get OLED and the 16 and the 14 get up to 90 HZ although it
goes all the way down to 48 if you want to save some battery life speaking of displays one of my largest complaints about the XPS 13 plus was that when you get the OLED display even though it looks absolutely beautiful it kills your battery really really hard and they have a solution for that now in here we have what they call a p OLED so instead of having some nice glass right here on the front it's actually plastic one little point of clarification though we won't have plastic on the screen it will still
be Gorilla Glass just the OLED itself is bonded to plastic and I don't really understand why but that allows them to double the brightness and have the power consumption that's magic basically but also that's the kind of magic that I want to see in my laptop I don't know why the XPS team didn't give the alien wear team the memo that I'm going to take the laptops apart but they were kind enough to just do it for me so we can do whatever we want to these ones oh we dropped it that's too bad
anyway what they are super proud about is if you look at this fan right here this right here is the old xps15 fan you can see not only is the new one larger but they have these little Tippy tips on the end which do what why is that good turbo fication tur turbo fication sure but seriously though it's all about surface area in these fans so we have more blades longer blades we are going to be able to get a lot more cooling through these but they haven't just improved these fans but also how
they work so if we look at the old XPS 15 the intake is all along the bottom here which has a couple of problems the main one being if you uh put it on your lap like this you are blocking the intake it gets quite hot your Chan of reproductive success goes down and it's just a general bad time not so in the new one so if you look right here it intakes from the side so even if you have it on like a blanket or something like that it might be successful draws it across all of the components in here
hopefully cooling down your VR Rams memory all of that stuff and then yeting it out the back right here while we're in here we can have a look at the upgrade ability so we can swap out our SSD right there and uh that's about it Dell did you know that someone uh created a lowprofile swappable super highpe memory standard anyway they didn't use that but they do have super fast Ram in here this when it's soldered down can go up to 7467 heck yeah I nailed it that's a strange number and it's also incredibly
high so they presumably are able to do that because look at the distance between this core and those RAM chips that does not have to travel very far to get you those sort of speeds for the batteries in the 14 we get a 69 nice. 5w hour battery in the 16 we get oh dear a 99.5 W hour that is just on the edge of how large you are able to get into one of these and they're saying between the efficiency gains of the new Intel Core Ultras and the variable refresh rate of those displays the battery life numbers
should be better but we'll have to test that ourselves of course what we can test now though are the webcams Dell has a new 1080p camera on their XPS line and they say it is excellent and frankly the one on the 15 is not hard to beat this thing uh kind of sucks we're going to move around right here it is grainy it looks blown out and it also looks underexposed at the same time it is just a train wreck especially when you compare it too oh my God it actually is a good thing right here look at this I
can turn around oh even right there it's figuring out the exposure with this right here big bright light my face still looks totally fine I can spin around it was hot there for a second but it has figured it out dang you guys actually might have done it look at that it is uh is it smoothing or like I feel like it's doing a little bit of filtering to my face but compared to this hunka junk right here this is a nice big old Improvement couple more things here so the little capacitive
touch stuff up at the top apparently a lot of people complained on the 13 plus that uh this just stays on all the time and it kind of sucks if you're watching a movie or something like that so on the new ones it just turns off after 10 seconds and you can choose if you want that behavior or the old stuff in the Bios also we have a co-pilot key right here which I'm sure is going to age excellently just like the big speak ke did and finally the speakers so on all of them we have two downfire firing
wolfers two little tweeters in the top 8 watts on the 14 10 watts on the 16 so let's give them a little sniff oh also the keyboard's great uh it's the same as on the XPS 13 plus but a little bit larger this is pre-production they don't  yet I think that needs to go back in the oven anyway yeah the the software for the audio is not on there we will will give them a break just like I'm going to give you a break I hope that you guys enjoyed this video hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day
all dead because they've got a whole new lineup here this right here is the XPS 14 the 13 now we already have the 13 plus but it's called a 13
