I have a bit of a confession to make despite having a pretty cool computer there's something I've neglected a little bit my monitor I'm running the same monitor since like 2014 and it's just always been I don't know is this really good enough to upgrade uh you know another 100 HZ another 50 HZ a couple more pixels but seriously today I think this has changed I'm at the Asus booth at computex 2024 and they're showing off the Rog Swift OLED PQ 27 AQ DP a 1440p OLED 480 HZ monitor honestly I'm just kind of
at a loss for words they had it running the New Horizon game but we turned the FPS counter on and I was like uh it looked great the pixels were clear but it was running at 80 FPS I think they need a little bit better computer for this but this game the finals I lowered all the settings I turned on dlss frame gen and I think we're at 450 FPS now close I don't know how well this is going to come across on camera but with the response time of OLED pixels and this refresh rate this is actually nuts
look at that text Glacier lacoin Cafe I think it's getting a little bit screw because dlss frame gen but I promise you it is astonishingly smooth even the gun you might recognize this display because we did see it at CES briefly but at that time they were only showing blur Busters because it was such an early sample but now we can actually game on it right now we're just playing a 1080p definitely not as sharp as it could be like if I go in here and go you know let's let's turn
up the settings now I want my my OLED premium viewing experience we can have that now we're down to like 300 FPS but the game looks a lot better and man I I think I have found my new monitor I've been an ultra wide person for like 10 years and I think it's time to change naturally being OLED it does have HDR features I mean they're saying at a 3% "window it's around 1,200 nits 10% window" around 800 nits and a full screen you're around 275 it's not the brightest thing we've ever seen but that is also still
pretty bright now with HDR enabled calibrated and in the game this is what I've been missing and it's still like because it's OLED don't get me wrong even though we're only getting 100 something FPS right now it looks smooth that's because the pixels can refresh so fast that it looks clear at least you can definitely tell if you move around really fast that the frame rate is not quite there but if you had a faster computer or running a game that runs a little bit better it's pretty
much the Best of Both Worlds you're not what what are you losing here maybe Peak brightness or you know when they have a QD OLED version of this naturally let's look at the clarity in a m uniform test oh my God this might as well just be a printed piece of paper that's like rolling past is this actually insane but I'm sure you're going to ask it's expensive right it's definitely not cheap they are targeting the same as the "last generation around $1,000 and" they're looking to release this early Q3
so we're getting very close but for the amount of display that you're getting for the money it's not a cheap product but this ticks practically every box the only one that I can see left is CET which I'm sure this time next year that's probably what we'll be looking at I don't know if I can wait though just like you can't wait for this Segway to our sponsor thanks to private internet access for sponsoring our 2024 computex coverage their VPN network spans across six continents and 91 countries letting

individual pixel off when you want to see black it's just it's a little bit bigger and a lot brighter this is a micro LED display and we've seen these on the channel before but the big difference here is the size and it's quite magnificent I actually saw this display at CES about 6 months ago and I asked them like please let me take the bloody thing apart I want to see how it works and they were like oh oh you might break it but today they've agreed to let  apart oh well that wasn't that hard I'm
trying to figure out how many pixels are on an individual panel so the pixel pitch which is the distance between each of these tiny little pixels which is its own LED is 0.78 MM we have seen tighter ones but still very cool but it's exactly 10x 10 panels so if I count this there's 10 and then this way twice as wide 10 this way 100 that means how many pixels are on this let's do the math "83,000 pixels on this individual panel" "83,000 LEDs that's a lot of LEDs as you" might have seen already there is
actually two individual pcbs there's just a little tiny gap between them naturally that would create a tiny bit bigger space between the pixels than you know say in the middle of one of the pcbs so they compensate for that by calibrating the display and increasing the brightness along that edge so that that Gap kind of disappears obviously if you go really close you can see it but at a normal viewing distance they kind of just fade away I'm kind of surprised at how simple it is though it's these
two connectors and then magnets and pins it just clicks on can I put it on oh I got a little dirty okay gently very  sides that's actually so easy wo and then on the inside we can get a bit of a sneak peek at the PCB behind this unit not unlike a more commercial tiled display it's just all connected together with ethernet that's how the signal gets to the individual sections and then broken out into the individual panels it's very a commercial style still but then just distilled down into
a much much easier form factor there we go ah look at that there's our ethernet so there's like a PCB the cables labeled to go to the PCB there's a little power supply so it's not power over ethernet there's definitely power wires in here it's less complicated than I thought I was expecting this to be like a whole operation but it's just a it's just a fancy vacuum like I mentioned before 4K "but the peak brightness is 1,600 nits" it's 97% DCI P3 color gamut coverage to Asus million to1 contrast ratio which
sounds a bit strange right like olev the big thing with microed is you can turn off an individual pixel or LED for that matter so in theory it's it's infinite to one but maybe I guess there's just a little bit more reflection when the display is off so they're like a million to one close enough but my God just look at the thing from this distance can you see the lines Dennis it's kind of hard to see sometimes like it's there you can see the line but you just you just walk back this way
and it all just melts into one giant really bright high contrast display I found one more monitor that you're not going to believe it's not this one though it's in here see it's an OLED on an AO but not just any OLED it's a flexible OLED on an AO I don't know why but I like it and I like you so get subscribed and see you later
