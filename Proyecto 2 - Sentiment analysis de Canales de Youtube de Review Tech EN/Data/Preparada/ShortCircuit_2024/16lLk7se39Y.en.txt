there's two things a man loves sexiness and power and the o1d provides you both in a beautiful enclosure just like a Lamborghini which is why this collab between lean Lee and Lamborghini makes a lot more sense than I actually thought the o1d Evo RGB automobile Lamborghini Edition is a cool new refresh of the recently introduced o1d Evo RGB before we get in there let's figure out let's see what's in this top box I'm not going to lie going straight from uh a beautiful Lamborghini color to just
blank cardboard is a bit of a dip in the experience but what do we have in here a nice little screw organizer some metal brackets not sure exactly what they're for uh we'll find out soon comes with a GPU anti- sag bracket as well and then paperwork I'm assuming this might be for the RGB we'll find out as we go along the o1d has been around for a while and has received a fair number of revisions and for good reason it's a great case that has a balance of customizability as
well as just looking really good without having to put in too much effort and that's why we've seen so many cofy cats from case manufacturers all around but I feel like no one really quite does it just like lean Lee and I'm really excited to see how they've taken the design sensibilities of a Lamborghini and added it to this case and our first hint of that is sporty carbon fiber I'm not sure if the stuff around the legs is legitimate carbon fiber or if it's just like a fancy
plastic but I do know that the panels at the top are real carbon fiber cuz that's what Le and Lee says they are come off  in ooh it's got this half mirror finish that I'm a huge fan of that makes it so that when the room's really bright and the computer's off it's got like an air of mystery to it but when we have RGB and lots of beautiful lights in it it's going to Glow through and look really really cool it looks really sick I'm very excited with this being a Evo RGB case it's not going to have the triple
glass panels that you find on the o1d vision but you know it's still kind of hitting a nice balance of performance versus just Aesthetics speaking of which this is a limited run case we got number 00 of "6,498 why would they make such a weird" number the amount of cases they're building well it's actually the displacement of the Aventador engine 6.5 L if they start at zero that means "there's technically 6,499 of these being" made just just saying another small little detail that they've added is that
all of these thumb screws are accented with the Gallow Orion which is the signature y Lamborghini yellow also the accent RGB on the case has been specifically panone color matched to the very same color on the back there's a couple of buttons that aren't familiar for uh Evo owners it says CPU GPU and color because there's a special stat screen that you can have in the back here here just to look at the numbers just cuz it's cool that's something that you just don't see at all with any of
the Le and Le cases by default and impressively they actually like made a custom cutout on mounting mechanism if you look at a normal Evo RGB this whole back panel was just kind of mesh but this has been purposely filled in to mount the screen I will say I just noticed something that makes me feel like the screen might have been a bit of an afterthought and that's the fact that that cable that we got inside of our accessories bin plugs into the back through the the outside like this and a
USB cable right into your motherboard it's the back of your PC case so it's going to be full of cables anyways but it's a little bit less than elegant they went to the effort to make a specific back panel but they didn't decide to uh you know go all the way and make this really smooth um outside of those little accents this is actually its own unique color compared to the normal black Evo RGB I can't really tell the difference without having them side by side this is a nice black case but I don't know if it
seems that special of a black now even though there's been a lot of Evo style cases with the Dual chambered layout I've actually never built in an o1d EVO type case so I'm actually really excited to look at this and see what all of the fuss is about I had a dual chamber case way back in the day the Corsair a540 which was a beast of a case back when or Corsair was like  I meant to do that thanks to epomaker for sponsoring this video the th80 Pro V2 is the latest to their th80 lineup
and touts a bunch of upgrades and new additions it's now fully via programmable and features a 1.14 in customizable RGB screen that you can personalize with the system information or even your own image or logo maybe a picture of a pretty friend maybe me and of course it still has the awesome features you'd expect like a hot swappable PCB south facing RGB and options for Wired and wireless connections head over to our description box and go check it out the one of the cool things about this case is that it
has just a crazy amount of support at the bottom of the case we have support for a 360 mm Rad or 3 140 mm fans another 360 mm Rad or 3 140 mm fans up here at the top you can actually get a 420 mm radiator as well as again room for three 140 mm fans I guess it should yeah that maths out like it's a crazy amount of support while still allowing for that crazy amount of tempered glass all Soo you see this here we don't need that we can take this out to get that nice seamless fish tank
kind of look and we're definitely going to do that today another crazy thing is that all of these are on brackets so they're just easy to assemble you can unscrew them take them out put all your fans on and then put it back in Easy Peasy on the back of our case we see the other chamber for our power supply as well as just a crazy amount of support for storage in the modern day here you can have four 2 and 1/2 in ssds or two 3 and 1/2 in hard drives and another two ssds here on this woo swinging bracket
that has a magnet to close and you have room for another two hard drives or ssds with these removable cages I find it weird how they kind of decided to cut mesh into this um cuz it's not really going to be a high airflow kind of area it's going to go into the back of your motherboard one thing that's a little disappointing because it is a case in 2024 is that it doesn't appear to have any support for back mounted power adapters on your motherboard so if you were hoping to get that cabless look
you're still kind of going to have to deal with albeit the great Cable Management that is available to us like look at these mounts these nice rubber grommets and all these convenient places like they've really gone out of their way to make this a great cable managing experience if you want that super clean reverse cutout look you can't get that here maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is actually a fully reversible case um so while we have our main computer chamber over here we can
actually reverse the whole thing and put our PSU chamber over on the other side and the and the glass side panels on this so that if you want to put it on the left side of your desk or the right side of your desk you're never going to have to deal with just staring at the uh you know the less than interesting back panel though maybe you would want that cuz you can remember that you are number zero can you imagine if they released it they just all said that they were zero
everybody wins I think we're just about ready to start building in it but before we get there I just want to talk about the front I/O and some of the buttons here we have our power button reset button and then four buttons dedicated to the AR argb that's on the case itself for front IO we have a USBC and two USB a ports as well as a combo mic and audio jack and one fun thing is that this is actually removable which means you can mount it in a few different locations on the case you can put it on the side or
you can put it on the back to have a totally clean cableless look while still not losing out on ports I will say for a case this big I wouldn't mind seeing a little bit more front IO maybe two USBC ports at least however le le does sell an accessory where you can add a couple of extras just would would be nice but you know I don't know why it's always the same kind of like twill pattern though is there like different carbon fiber patterns yeah everyone know maybe that's probably the biggest part is that
it's just like well now you know it's carbon fiber cuz it looks like this most of the time when I'm doing cases on this channel I'm doing small form factor stuff so this it feels like it's going to be a breeze of a build with all of the space as well as oh that's where that screw went in terms of motherboard support this case supports uh ATX and eatx motherboards you can put a radiator at the bottom and at the top but depending on the thickness of your radiator you might encounter issues with
hitting the motherboard thankfully lean Le has provided you with two different mounting Heights for your motherboard to allow for extra compatibility at the bottom or at the top at the lowest position you have a ton of space at the top for a radiator plus thick fans but you are kind of limited to just 25 mm fans at the bottom we'll put the exact compati ability dimensions on the screen something to note it's still very spacious case and you shouldn't have too many issues but it's nice that they
included the feature we're going to be doing the uh lower position because we're not going to be doing a bunch of crazy radiators and it's already in the position by default since we know we don't want this support bracket anyways we're just going to get rid of it right now not only have they like placed inserts in here in a way that makes sense but they also have left behind the spare inserts so that you can set this up as an organization tool however you want that's pretty sick uh we're going
to start getting our fans installed and to do that we're going to take out this bottom bracket nice and easy like that if you want to put 3 40 mm fans at the front these are 120s but bear with me in this position you need to use some sort of a unian type solution where the they are all connected because the top two screw points on your fan will not have anywhere to screw in so you need something that allows them to connect kind of like lean Le's uh unian solution brand synergy you know I will say this
it's kind of surprising that they don't give you any fans whatsoever not one in the back not a couple in the front especially for a case at this price point now let's get that PSU in then we'll get the GPU in and then we're going to be uh cruising there is a limit to how long your power supplies can be this is quite a large one I hope we're not at that limit I think this does have pretty good support one of the ways they increase power supply compatibility is that they have this little bracket that
juts out the back is it exactly elegant no but is it the back of your computer yeah so who cares that a that's a chunky boy I am loving all of the easy Cable  here yeah yeah that's nice uh GPU time we're almost folks there we are almost there and uh I'm not going to lie this has been a pretty smooth experience I can really appreciate the crazy of thought that went into producing this case Asus back at it again with the biggest GPU of all time we're just doing a dark dark Rock Elite just an air
cooler this thing can support air coolers up to 167 mm in height so pretty much any air cooler you can throw at it is going to fit except with the exception of maybe some really really  ones I did all the cables already this Noob forgot to install his CPU Cooler I've built how many computers in my life and I have made such a terrible mistake I was worried because this thing wasn't going in the back because it was supposed to be put on beforehand cuz I forgot cuz I'm a I made
a big mistake today you know there's a lot of standoffs in this motherboard and what that is preventing us from doing is bending the motherboard enough to get this bracket on the back of it in its current position so we're just going to take out a few of these  yeah yeah woo can I get a woo louder yeah let's go not too much time lost I spent more time panicking than I did actually fixing it it was actually easier than I thought everyone going get mad at me for put on too much thermal paste because
I'm so overwhelmed right now and I got to take that off you can't leave that on just what I don't know if this is how that goes yet I think I'm missing some things I am I need to do this first why isn't it screwing in day two emotionally we've been cleansed we're feeling better off camera what we did was that we got some lowprofile Ram so that this cooler would now fit we've put our GPU in and we're just about ready to try booting her up did I flip the thingy on  you hey hey oh this is a I will say this
a definitely probably was thinking more of an aiio when they decided to put this screen back here it's not going to be very visible with this honken air cooler the fans looking good though there's a lot of rainbow puke right now but it is all coordinated let's get the panels on the case and then we'll check out the RGB Prof FS so you can see that uh this is the far more reflective side uh see you see Glenn the inside of it is chromed so it's like a half silvered mirror which
is what same kind of glass that you'd use inside of like a police interrogation Booth so there's a ton of different manual RGB patterns and profiles um you can set for solid colors or some sort of breathing and cycling tons of really cool stuff and that's also going to sync up with our fans inside once we get software installed I don't think we're going to do that so far I'm trying to just make it the nice Lamborghini Gallow is that the yellow cuz I feel like the yellow
and the screws was more um it was more like this yellow that also feels kind of green it does I don't really know that's to me this is the nicer yellow and also makes me think of like the Lamborghini cars I've seen in real life I think the carbon fiber looks really cool I think that the color is great it's just a great case overall to build in but here's the thing and we're going to turn the lights back on the lights are back on but there's something I totally forgot it's the screen which is kind of
hard to see currently I don't know if the camera can pick it up at all but  um but it's not super bright and that's kind of hard to see through this halfs silvered glass this is probably pre-released software it'll probably have a different name it might be integrated into the lconnect app that they use that you can use for like controlling the screens on your fans and on the Galahad cooler right now it's kind of early days and I think and it looks like it's just its own little thing because they don't have
a screen quite like this in their catalog and there it is that's the little screen it looks like the gauge cluster on a car though it doesn't really resemble any dashboard from Lamborghini that I'm aware of uh you can adjust it to show how fast and how hot your GPU and CPU are running so this is the CPU temperature the reason the GPU is showing zero is because the GPU is disabled on this laptop right now to preserve battery life you can change which stats you want to see your CPU or
your GPU we also have the color uh if I press it it's got a pretty solid delay before it comes on but again it's just a display screen it doesn't need to be that crazy I am a little concerned about how bright it is and it doesn't look like the software has any sort of the software just like makes it run it doesn't seem to have any like gooey that allows me to adjust settings or anything like that it doesn't seem like it's very customizable but how well can you see that how visible is that screen pretty
visible is it what if I like angle it like it's still pretty visible it's still pretty visible okay it's a little bit better than what it had when we just had it running idle I wish there was more places to mount it it feels like it was very much slapped in there in the last minute cuz you can't uh mount it at the front or anything like that has its position at the back there and that is where it shall stay and if you're somebody who would rather have an air cooler than an
AIO um it kind of gets overshadowed by your air cooler which is disappointing because outside of the carbon fiber and the screen they don't really add a lot of value for the price that they're charging and that price is $29 $99 which is $140 more than what the Evo RGB normal Edition costs so in one way it looks slick it seems it's probably pretty powerful but it's way overpriced so it's suiting for Lamborghini which is a shame because man this looks so cool if you wanted to do
this kind of mirrored look you could do it yourself by just buying a reflective film that goes on the inside it's a pretty easy mod to do uh takes like maybe half an hour it's not that expensive and you can get a similar look it won't look quite as good as a from the factory application but if it was $50 more expensive rather than 140 I would say that this would be an easy recommend if you really wanted to go for the reflective look but it's tough to recommend this when the premium is so
high just so you can get a specific case number and um pledge allegiance to an Italian automaker but despite my price problems what remains true is that this is an excellent flexible case that looks great there's a reason why everybody is making one of these and why everybody wants one they're awesome maybe it's a little boring at this point but I'm not going to lie this is my first time building in it it is a great experience Le and Le has really knocked it out of the park and I get why they just keep
trying to pump out the same thing because it's a damn good product thanks for watching short circuit if you liked this video why don't you check out another cool expensive case the Thor Zone Nano Q it's a small formfactor case it's Ultra Premium and also kind of wonky
