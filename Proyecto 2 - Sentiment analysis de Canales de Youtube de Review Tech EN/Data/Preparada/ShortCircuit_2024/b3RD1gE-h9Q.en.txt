I've been daily driving a fold 4 for the last two years which is why I was really excited for the fold six because mine if you can hear it oh not in the greatest of uh shapes so we're going to check out the fold six see what they've actually improved in the last two years oh wow we got the gray version very nice is there anything else did it not come with the cable oh thank goodness I was going to say first they take away the wall wart then they take away the cable okay good
we just got a USB C Toc here feels like about 3 and 1/2 ft so from the wall to your nightstand probably fine but I don't know I like my 10 m one at home 10 me 10t 10t one and right away I can already say I missed when my phone used to go this flat this is really nice already just to hold the crease is barely visible I mean with the screen off it's pretty visible but I think once the device is on it'll be better but that camera bump holy cow why not just make the phone that thick and then you get
like extra battery that's that is ridiculous they move the flash off to the side on this one instead of underneath looks like USBC on the right side once it's open down firing speaker top speaker here some of your mics there is an unders screen camera on the open screen and then on the oh man that is a stiff hinge but I guess again maybe it just needs to be worn in a little bit and then there's just undre camera on the front here here we've got our volume and our fingerprint power
button on this side here as well as our SIM card on this side here which is very nice to see that it will take a physical SIM card instead of just an eim the inside screen is 7.6 in diagonally and then the front screen is 6.3 which is actually 0.1 bigger than the fold five just because they've changed the pixel count of both the vertical and the horizontal on the cover screen here the old screen was 904 pixels across and this one is 969 nice it's a small number difference but I think it feels like
wider than my original one I can't quite tell just initially it definitely has some body changes you'll notice that this screen on the new one definitely sits more like flush and flat whereas mine kind of has a slight angle to it which I think is nice but again that camera bump man just really annoying to be fair I didn't like it on this one um but let's uh let's turn it on and see what we can see here but not after you hear a word from our sponsor oh God D Brand's the sponsor y they have their
new case harden skins where you get a 3% chance of getting their rare blue gem skin so uh find it and apply it I hate stickers we'll find out one day where did you not put it in here it's like that Meme of the guy just mining one day he'll hit it big oh my God it's this one it was in the first pile okay well screw you debrand oh okay this is kind of pretty never mind no it's not I won't give it to them hold holy look at that gloss all righty that's kind of cool I'm going to cover
our asset sticker oh okay actually up like really bad take a look Belle oh my God skill come on now oh he got it thanks Dad all right that does actually give it some nice Bling No you're not supposed to put that part on that doesn't go on this it is it's the outside no it's not it's the outside brother this doesn't go on yes it does oh it does fit all righty I guess it looks pretty sick when it's on there if you guys want to buy the case harden skin head overshort lines.com and you can also
have a 3% chance to get the blue gem skin well cuz it I don't think it represents dbrand the best if I want to take it off because it's got our asset sticker bump under it all right so I'm going to remove it I'm sorry dbrand I'll steal it and put it on my phone later you took the acid tag with it oh oh there we go both screens turning on during the boot up just like classic wow this is a very bright screen which makes sense lab tested it and actually got a little bit higher than the 2600 nits
that Samsung claims they got 2800 on the middle screen here and 2700 on the front screen which I think is over 700 nits brighter than last generation which is honestly pretty impressive for a phone that naturally has a pretty reflective screen it's going to really help in those outside situations where you're watching a YouTube video or playing a game with a screen this big one of the first things I did with my fold 4 was actually start watching a lot of more YouTube content on my phone I want to
hear how the speakers sound we're going to listen to crab Rave so as you can see I pulled out my fold four which has a little bit of a Bend to it but that's okay we're going to do the brightness and kind of the color test on both these screens side by side it is noticeably brighter on the fold six which is great and you can also see the screen size difference this screen size feels a little bit bigger than mine even if I was to flatten mine down which I won't I'm scared it's going to break but let's
listen to the speakers on uh my fold four  good yeah this is definitely much louder which doesn't always translate to better keep that in mind sometimes louder speakers can get distorted or crackle in this case I can't really notice so I would be okay with putting these on full volume maybe not if I'm like trying to watch a YouTube video late at night that might scare me if I open a Tik Tok and it's just yelling at me but I'm sure some audio file out there is probably going to have issues with this but as
someone who just wants to watch YouTube and enjoy it those are great for just consuming media I think one of my favorite features by the way on the fold with YouTube is you can just likeo and prop it up if you have it on like a counter or something that is such a cool little feature then you got all your controls there it's dumb it's stupid but I I like it oh when the screen's all white you can kind of notice the unders screen camera which is the weakness of these unders screen
cameras sometimes they have to adjust the opacity or the number of pixels or a whole variety of things in order to still get an image through the screen but let's uh let's play some genin one thing I found surprising when I got a folding device was how many more games I played I enjoyed going back to Plants versus Zombies I had felt like I had so much room looking at my backyard and everything and I can already say again I'm going to fall in love with something like this cuz there's so much real
estate play Call of Duty mobile I know a lot of pubg mobile players ended up really enjoying some folding devices simply because they got bigger fields of view or more access for more controls yeah already I'm loving it this is awesome so much screen real estate it feels very smooth doesn't quite feel like 120 which the center screen does support it supports up to 120 HZ but I mean a lot of games also don't necessarily go that high Sometimes some games are capped at 60 it's not getting
crazy hot which is positive I mean my old device didn't either but it's not like they're trying to push this Snapdragon 8 gen 3 to its absolute limits but it's still like not warm to the touch at all right now it's handling this very well very playable experience see my phone doesn't lay flat but this doesn't either when you have a camera bump this big it still causes you to tilt it's tilting me this ah just make it sorry passionately hate camera bumps I would much rather a phone be thicker
and I get better cooling or better battery because the phone's already that thick it doesn't actually make the phone thicker sorry this is a mini rant no I'm not now this was the only game that actually pushed our GPU to 100% usage and I got to say it still is not heating up in my hand right now uh it seems totally fine to play with it is actually a new GPU over the last one it's the adreno 750 instead of the 740 but overall I think it's still fine we're getting an average of 53 FPS
according to our Labs testing for an FPS game 60 FPS is kind of my you know go-to bar but man mobile chips this is awesome you would never have been able to play any sort of game like this you know a couple years ago even at this frame rate this is awesome while on paper a lot of the specs might not be crazy different especially when it comes to the camera the cameras are all actually the same as last generation and the generation before the biggest feature that Samsung
was pushing at their event was Galaxy AI including enhance your communication with call assist chat assist Unleash Your productivity note assist transcript assist create epic images including a drawing assistant where you can like draw a microphone into a cat's hand and then it has a microphone let's try note assist oh you have to turn each individual setting on oh my goodness you know what I don't mind that I think that's a healthier way to integrate AI into your device cuz maybe there's
something you don't want it to do right for example if you don't want it to touch your photos because that's your family or something that makes total sense ooh check out the new notes notes smarter not harder cringe I'm going to draw a cat let's see if it can pick up what is that it's a cat give me a second I haven't drawn the legs is that yeah ghost Pikachu is that a horse it's a cat okay how do I AI it oh oh that looks like an AI button sketch to image yes Trace around the drawing you want to
transform I want this to become a cat holy holy cow this is my magnumopus all right let's try a different drawing maybe that wasn't good enough for the AI Belle give me a suggestion car all righty let's draw a car you know maybe it would be nicer if it came with a stylus apparently it has a new case though that it can you can buy which has a stylus holder um if you plan on using this very often I would suggest that all right AI fix my  flare you know what it's pretty bad okay
hold on maybe maybe I just didn't give it like the right prompt can I like can you change cuz it it's giving me like watercolored can I oh yeah illustration 3D cartoon pop art sketch maybe I'll try that maybe that that that's going to fix it that's what's that's what this needs oh okay that's pretty cute that looks awesome that's way better oh I love it it's kind of cool there's a lot of features that can help you in the commercial for this they showed someone kind of having the translated text to
Spanish or something on the other side while they write English it's kind of nice I don't travel and I'm not an artist so for me all these AI features are just me but maybe that everyone to each their own you know another thing they talked about was this is going to get seven OS revisions and seven years of security updates which honestly Kudos this is a year and a half though I'm not holding this phone for 7 years so unless this device can actually hold up over those seven years that promises useless
to me and I think it's going to be useless to a lot of people especially cuz the screen repair on it is so expensive when I got a quote to get mine fixed it was I could just buy another flagship phone it was not worth it overall I don't mind that Samsung isn't making huge revisions between each one it doesn't make me feel like oh I've missed out I should have waited a year it's kind of nice they're doing little revisions over time but starting at "$1,900 for this phone you could buy a"
car for the same price it it's ridiculous pricing for a phone that might not last again I might just be a one-off experience mine might have been bad I don't know but I don't know if I could jump the boat right away to it maybe I'll jump the boat to the seven I don't know you guys you you guys can make your own opinion on it well thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed the video if you did like it and if you did so much go check out my gam scent video I got to smell video games it gave me a headache
