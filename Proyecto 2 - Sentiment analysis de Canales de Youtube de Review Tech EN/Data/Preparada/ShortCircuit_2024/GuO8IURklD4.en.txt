just a couple of years ago a keyboard like this would have cost you over $200 w√® sponsored this video so I can show you the sk75 a beautiful mechanical keyboard that costs a whole lot less than that about $110 in fact you like that yeah it's a 75% mechanical keyboard hot swap PCB what else we got in this box we got a w box with probably a cable it is "Wireless it's got a 4,000 amp hour" battery and three different modes like all the good ones do but I am a cabled man myself I don't like the cable very
much but you know what it's perfectly fine maybe that's how they're cutting the cost a little bit it's got a fite bead here and it's pretty long I'll give him that oh yeah 6ot cable H I'm not 6 foot so typical USB a to c what else we got we got a bunch of bags here we got three extra switches I think these are their mint blizzard switch should be a nice Palm linear ooh that's nice we got three of these we got three extra key caps uh the only problem that I have right now is these don't fit
the color scheme at all so I'm not going to use them just green red yellow command command opt so if you want to use Mac go ahead and swap these out so you don't get confused when you're trying to find the right Keys later we've also got a nice key cap and switch puller this is always my favorite one for people to to include because just these little wires here are so good for getting key caps off really easy and then uh this is just a great little switch puller I don't know I personally
just really strongly prefer this this type so thank you very much for including it and then we've got ooh okay three other key caps these ones actually do match the rest of our keyboard it's a nice kind of like soft baby blue love to see it looks like they're double shot PBT as well look at that it matches our new macad dress Oxford shirt perfectly this nice pastel blue with this keyboard oh my God okay on more serious not let's look at the keyboard itself the only thing left
in the Box it's heavy and not just because it's an all aluminum chassis but also because it's got a nice little cool weight on the bottom does it do anything no will you see it most of the time no but damn it does it look cool when you look at the bottom of the board uh one really cool feature about the SK 75 is that not only can you get this back weight in a number of styles but you can also get these cool accent frames in different styles so check this out they actually sent us one you could swap it
out to something white with this like granity rock kind of texture I'm not sure what that one's called but it's shiny and looks pretty imagine the possibilities they're endless well they're not endless but they have a lot of different combinations that you can check out and choose from because this keyboard comes in a variety of colors as well uh so you can really kind of choose whatever you want that suits your own style or your desk setup or whatever you're looking for uh while we're looking at the back
we can see that it's got four little rubber feet here works well enough I like the little nubb and feet but uh if you want to keep it nice and flesh with the desk these work a little better than the Nubs one thing I've kind of noticed now that I'm looking at it is that I don't actually see any kind of switch anywhere to turn it on and off or toggle between the different Wireless modes um and that's because it's just got this USBC plug at the top here if you want to turn it on you got to take off the caps
lock key ah and then here it is you got this nice little toggle switch oop turn it on this is an aesthetic choice and I personally really like it because I'm the kind of person who doesn't ever use the different Wireless modes that are available I tend to stay wired and if I am using one it's typically just 2.4 GHz cuz there's less latency involved so if you're the kind of person who's who's like actively switching all the time because you got it hooked up to different devices or you're traveling a
lot with it I don't think you should travel with this thing cuz it's pretty heavy but you do you um it could be kind of annoying is it hard to take a single key cap off and then flick this switch no it's really not you know that takes all of a couple seconds but it's not always especially with these uh oh really nice edges uh it's actually really hard to take this off with your fingers so you you've got to keep the keycap puller handy and I don't think everyone's going to do that you do you
it's your choice I personally really like it and I think it looks great I think it's a fantastic way to hide certain things that kind of look a little less desirable but definitely something to think about and consider when you're making this purchase one thing that I didn't catch cuz it was jammed all the way in the back of the box there is it does in fact come with a dongle so don't worry if you do want to use 2.4 GHz you're set otherwise for Bluetooth connectivity it should work
just fine you just you know turn it on hit function tab that's probably Bluetooth blinking blue such a sucker for heavy keyboards you're a sucker I am a sucker all right ooh 1.8 kilos baby 4.1 lb incredible 65.8 o love weighing everything in ounces it's a little hard to see the internals without taking it apart but you can see here we've got this nice clear white plastic it's a flex cut polypropylene plate and this whole thing's gasket mounted with a ton of foam layers in 
say sounds pretty good I'd like it to be a little bit more marble and creamy and deep but you can probably achieve that by modding it just a little bit honestly for a like zero rattle in the stabilizers uh one of the nice things that I really like about 75% boards that you don't really get with a 65% board is the F row um I know that you can just hit function five and it's the same as F5 I know that you can hit function alt four and it's the same as hitting alt f4 but there's
just something a bit more satisfying but only using two fingers rather than three and not needing this whole extra hand in there I mean I guess you can really like I can still technically hit alt f4 with one hand but uh it's a little uncomfortable so yeah personally I prefer a 75% over 65% the typing angle seems totally fine once again I'm going to complain a little bit that we don't have adjustable feet but I get it especially when it comes to full aluminum chassis uh it's not something
people seem to really care about except for me so I'll just go home and cry at the end of the day when I don't get them um but otherwise this thing is pretty solid for being 110 bucks the switches feel good they're just linear ah the typing experience really is just solid right out of the box I would like to put a bit of space bar foam in here just to make it a bit deeper to match the rest of the keys a little bit but uh it's not too far off so it's not too bad it's got
a pretty nice PCB in here Flex cut fr4 hot swap south facing RGB LEDs pretty much everything you want I'm not crazy about Flex cut cuz I like a really like con super consistent typing style even if it's a little firmer even the actually the gaskets don't feel this is kind of firm out of the box I actually kind of like this as for Branding and stuff you don't really get a lot it's just a little womier symbol here in the bottom right nicely embossed into the rest of the aluminum yeah
there's no screws like anywhere so it's probably one of those ones where you have to take all the key caps off here let me just investigate do a little bit of Investigation here yep so we've got one screw here um it's kind of okay you you know people are devisive about this too but uh I prefer when it's all just the same little tiny Phillips head I know that uh Allen keys are really good um but if you don't have a tiny Allen key set then it might be hard for you to take this thing apart that's one thing I
noticed they did not include with everything so if you do want to fully disassemble it do whatever you want to it you're not going to be able to do that without picking up an allen key but yeah it's pretty simple there's probably just like one here one here couple here just around the board probably like six or eight screws that you have to take off to then take the whole thing apart take all the keys off take the switches off all that so we're not going to do that though cuz uh I think it types
pretty good out of the box I'm just going to connect it to a computer and try to type on it one thing I do appreciate is that the white really does match the key caps I would love it if it was blue but here we are uh another really nice thing to note is that this does not have any proprietary software it's all via controlled so if you do want to do any sort of customization ooh that RGB is really good I don't know if it's just the strength of the uh LEDs that they've got on the PCB or if it's just how clear
the cases are on the switches but man that that is a bright keyboard I don't know how much it's showing up on camera but it's really good in person here it is with the lights off looks pretty good you're definitely not going to miss anything in the dark one thing about the RGB and the key caps is that they're not shine through they're double shot PBT like I mentioned before so if you want to like actually see the the light shine through the key caps to form the letters uh you're not going to get that here
you're going to have to buy some extra key caps but you know shine through key caps aren't that expensive all right let's type on it and  go I did 110 97 % I'm not super happy with it it feels really good to type on it doesn't feel good to speed type on just cuz like how deep everything goes I've been typing on uh like short throw uh chicklet keyboards a lot recently on my laptop and I've gotten used to just like really kind of feather touching everything and you know barely having to
press to to type fast but that's excuses the reality is it sounded good it felt pretty good I'm kind of into linear again so I don't know do I take this thing back to my desk honestly maybe I mentioned that it's wireless earlier the "battery in here is 4,000 milliamp hours" which is not bad the only thing I worry about personally is how long it actually lasts with this RGB blasting at you cuz like I said before it's actually really bright and that's typically what's going to kill your battery life on your
keyboard more than anything else so maybe just be a little cognizant of that um but otherwise I think this thing is honestly a really solid buy for like $110 there's a lot of keyboards around this price and so you do have options these days which is fantastic um like I said at the start of this video just a couple of years back that really wasn't the case if you wanted to get something that's full aluminum RGB Wireless with a decent battery hot swap especially something fully built with
switches and key caps you were looking at at least $130 $150 minimum if not in the more in the 200 range so it's actually really good to see something like this that's the sk75 from wiir thanks again for sponsoring this video what do you guys think what's your new favorite ultimate tier budget board and not something that's you know a little cheap or plastic I'm talking full aluminum full keyboard RGB hot swap Wireless what do you got let me know in the comments thanks for watching make
