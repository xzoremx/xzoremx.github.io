these I was expecting we've got the OnePlus 12 and 12r with OnePlus proudly displaying their never settle slogan and talking a lot about a return to their Flagship killer routs what I wasn't expecting is this a 50 wat wireless charger this thing will charge wirelessly faster than most phones charge over a wire even many flagships like oh I don't know the iPhone 15 and the Samsung s24 Ultra we're going to get to that in a minute let's start with the OnePlus 12 they have absolutely packed
this thing with kind of jaw-dropping claims oh wow is that ever gorgeous jeez Oppo has always pushed the envelope when it comes to the design of their backs sorry they have packed this thing with features with everything from 80 W wired charging with their super vuk technology which no way they actually include a capable charger in the Box what an idea to 50 W wireless charging to a claimed Peak brightness of "4,500 nits on their OLED display now we" weren't able to measure that outside of
the developer menu where they have a peak brightness test and then you can shine a bright flashlight into the ambient light sensor in order to get it to hit that number OnePlus also claimed 20 hours of YouTube playback which this phone completely annihilated we saw almost 28 hours of playback in YouTube at 200 nits display brightness wow on the outside of the phone we've got The Usual Suspects with our lock button volume rocker does this thing have an IR emitter super cool Amplified earpiece
speaker and bottom speaker Sim slot and USBC charging port along with oneplus's trademark notification slider you got to love to see it and on the inside it's got the latest Snapdragon 8 gen 3 processor with oneplus's biggest vapor chamber cooler to date they're saying it's about 14 Square in in area which is pretty wild when you consider the overall size of the device OnePlus says this contributes to both the cooling of the screen and cooling of the S so but we'll get to this in a little bit more
detail later we found that having a bigger Vapor chamber doesn't necessarily help you avoid thermal throttling if you don't add any kind of active cooling to the outside of the device the cameras are another big area of focus for OnePlus that is a sizable camera bump but far from the deepest one that I've seen lately it's pretty manageable and we're looking at a 50 megap main shooter with a 64 megapixel Periscope telephoto and a 48 megapix ultrawide that is a really fast lens on the main shooter too
f1.6 with Optical image stabilization actually have pretty high expectations for this the one area where OnePlus has really struggled for me in the past has been video but in terms of photo like man that's responsive that's a ton of dynamic range like I really just don't don't really know what I would complain about stutter though as I'm panning around yeah it's no iPhone is it it's not bad but it's no iPhone there's one thing that you got to give to Apple God does video ever look good on the iPhone
excuse me excuse me on iPhone inside the phone we've got Wi-Fi 7 Bluetooth 5.4 12 or 16 gigs of RAM with 256 or 512 gigs of storage and Corning victus 2 glass with an aluminum frame enough about the 12 because the 12 okay Flagship killer I guess now that flagships are "$1,200 the 12r is the one that I think" is going to be in a more interesting price band for many of our viewers today it's got a lot of the same goodness as the 12 it's got that same 4500 nit Peak brightness on its also ltpo 120 HZ
AMOLED display for that oh so butter smoothness it's got the same number of cameras but they have been downgraded a touch it's got the same support for 80 w super vuk charging including an included charging brick which is really nice to see but it's got a bit of a smaller screen and some other unexpected exclusions no wireless charging although that does come with a benefit you actually get a 100 mamp larger battery in the 12r and that did result in real world G GES in battery life this thing
saw almost 30 hours of battery life in our YouTube playback test that is flipping impressive but the bigger one is that it uses the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 it is using a last generation chipset however as we saw in our performance testing this might not be as big of a deal to you as you might think as it turns out in our Benchmark Suite which admittedly at this point is going to need some upgrading the real world differ difference in performance is almost negligible because we are more
often capped by the frame rate limiter of the applications that we are running than by the performance of the S so another thing that we noticed when we were doing our performance testing was that in our stress test the 12 actually thermal throttled so much that even though it scores much higher in synthetic benchmarks like 3D Mark when you run them over and over and over again it throttles down to Performance that is only about 10% High so if you're a hardcore mobile gamer and you're going
to be playing for hours at a time the real world difference in performance might not be that much now some of that can be accounted for by the slightly higher resolution of the OnePlus 12's screen but not all of it it does have the same victus two glass covering but what it doesn't have is the same storage options it's only available with 128 or 256 gigs of storage I also haven't really tried the camera yet so here's what we're going to do I'm going to take some pictures with this after I tell you
about our sponsor oh God it's dbrand they are supporting the OnePlus 12 show images on screen apparently that's all dbrand wants me to say about their OnePlus 12 skins because they instead wanted to use this ad spot to make me read a Reddit thread I assume that's why you're standing here with a computer oh this I've seen the Reddit thread let's get D Brand's attention to sponsor lonus to dye his hair blonde again upside down smiley face it should be for charity like sponsoring a
computer Club you now you've put me in a position where if I say no I'm basically saying no to Children you know what you did I should be using this as an  a that's the mug of a man who knows what he did I guess let dbrand know in the comments if you'd like me to disappoint children or if you'd like me to raise some money money for children uh I can hardly tell this these cameras are not as good it looks like I've got something on the lens but I did not Stills are all right though yeah
Stills are all right that video quality though and I haven't even tried the ultra wide yet it's only 8 megapixels that's one of the biggest downgrades over the OnePlus 11 because otherwise on paper the 12r looks like an amazing Choice compared to the 11 they've got very similar specs other than we get upgraded glass a bigger battery faster charging oh there is one small little bug bear OnePlus originally said that the 12r had ufs 4.0 support for its storage but it's actually 3.1 so that's
a downgrade over a OnePlus 11 if you could get a deal on one of those but other than that man I think the cameras are the biggest deal and I don't know about you guys but the only time I ever use my ultrawide camera is when I want to take a picture of a room and like put markup on it like honestly that's the only thing I think I've ever used it for is like uh yeah um here's a picture of this room we're going to Ikea I'm going to write some measurements and like where those spots are so that I can
remember what my room looks like when I'm walking around in that Labyrinthian store like it feels like you're in there for so long you don't even know what year it is or where you live anymore both phones are only rated for ip65 water resistance which is a little on the weaker side for a modern device but they ' got something water related that is pretty darn cool OnePlus has something that they're calling Aqua touch I'm sorry what is this hypertouch algorithm makes it like work better when
the screen is wet I've been provided with a spritzer bottle and I guess I'll  message I mean that seems like pretty good right let's let's go for accuracy okay give me a 100 character sentence go subscribe to Short oops that was me circuit that is pretty darn good it's bang on I like you uh here we go I mean what could go wrong um oh boy well that's something I can't even get I can't even get a text box hello I am typing oh and we lost it yeah that's pretty much the experience I whenever my hands
are wet in the tub we're down to 34% which means it's time to try 50 W wireless charging and what I'm really interested in is what's shaken with our charger here we're at 30 Watts from the wall there will be quite a bit of inefficiency going from AC to DC then from DC to um magnetic induction charging is that it it's going down air V charging buddy this isn't the only thing we weren't able to see working the way OnePlus said their frame interpolation technology we just couldn't get it working and they're
on Chinese New Year right now so they were like oh we can't really look into this so your mileage may vary on that as well but 27 Watts from the wall that means realistically we're probably only getting about 20 watts here it's possible that it'll only do that kind of speed from 0% but we're at 35 I think it's a pretty reasonable expectation that it would charge pretty fast when it's at 35% oh there's one more thing we haven't checked out the speaker ERS yet oh my God Google this was such a mistake what is
any of this remember when the mail icon was red so you could actually tell what the hell it was and when Maps was a map sorry sorry sorry this is this is not oneplus's fault 100% on Google a little bright but a big part of the problem is how loud I have it I wouldn't normally need this at  it's really good yeah it's really clean how about the 12r Amplified earpiece speaker nice to see that on a budget phone this is still an expensive phone but it's a little thing that is often 
on if there's a downgrade here it's not going to affect you too much I'd say they're not quite as bright but they're still really loud and clear enough that you're going to be able to enjoy pretty much anything you would want to enjoy on your phone speakers and otherwise you're just going to want to get out your your earphones or whatever the case may be now it's time for the hard question which one would I choose $300 less but that does come with a capacity downgrade here not to mention
of course the spec downgrade or $300 more but of course with more capacity more performance and bursty loads in particular I think this just comes down to your budget and what kind of deal you're going to get from your carrier as someone who takes a lot of pict pictures of my kids I am really not liking not having a decent camera on my phone right now and I'd say that that could be something that could push me over the edge to the 12 but I want to hear from you guys in the comments 12 or 12 r or
something else entirely whatever it is I don't care as long as you're subscribed to Short Circuit
