Samsung has had a TV that looks like art for a while now but high sense has entered the game with their new canvas TV and I got to say it looks really good it's using a 4K qled matte screen so not only will your movies and TV shows look great but while it's in its off State the minimal Reflections really give it that canvas look my mom wouldn't let me put it on the fridge so I put it on the TV it also runs Google TV meaning you can easily download all of your favorite streaming apps for your content and if
that's not enough it actually has four HDMI inputs so connecting all of your consoles is a brief the biggest difference is the price compared to the Samsung frame high sense canvas TV is $500 cheaper for the 55in model and $700 cheaper for the 65 in model that's the price of a PS5 Pro so what do you guys think can a TV be art
