on paper the 8bit do ultimate Mobile gaming controller seems to have pretty much everything going for it a refined dpad and shoulder buttons a metal reinforced joystick with hall effect sensors and software adjustments for better Precision hall effect triggers with the same adjustments so that you can either have them activate when you press them deeply or as more of a hair trigger adjustability so you can fit pretty much any device in it up to 170 mm in length and look at that they've
even got a couple of remappable pro paddle buttons on the back even the feel is really good reminding me more of like a desktop game controller than of a mobile one there's only one small problem my iPhone doesn't work in it there must be a good reason for this maybe the fact that it doesn't have a USBC cable integrated for pass through charging and instead relies on Bluetooth for the connection whatever the reason is it is compatible with Android only and that support Android 99 or later but we do
get one thing in return an extremely reasonable $50 price which is about $30 less than the comparable that we have from gamster and about half the price of a backbone one let's see what else comes in the Box though before we go any further the answer is not much you get a nice little manual thank you very much for that 8 bit do and a USB 8 Toc cable W basically only that see you later all right let's give this thing a shot shall we oh after we tell you about our sponsor drop drop's drop plus gr o ae1
headphones aim to improve on the original Pair by moving the drivers around with the goal of using the ears natural structure for a more natural and realistic sound field it also has a few minor quality of life tweaks that take it to the next level like a lighter clamping force and a single-sided cable the best thing is that it's now $100 less than the previous model so go click the link in the video description to learn how you can get your own pair of drop's new drop plus gr 081
headphones joysticks feel pretty good man actually surprisingly close to full desktop joysticks these are just about the size of they seem a little smaller do we have an Xbox controller handy oh man no it is the only difference between This and like a full fat desktop joystick is that the profile is ever so slightly lower you can barely even make it out on camera the shoulder buttons have a really nice click hear that sound but they're a little on the heavy side and they actuate right at the very top
and then they Mash down like this far so they end up feeling a little bit mushy stick pushes feel about as standard as they could possibly be so L3 and R3 and then these paddles on the back are something that as an older gamer I've never really gotten used to using but they feel fine I suppose yeah everything else here seems pretty bog standard are the face buttons the same size as desktop it looks like they're a little smaller yeah they're touch smaller but the actual layout looks
about the same size so I sincerely doubt that's going to bother anybody and they feel good okay let's pair this is a bit of a hassle aside from not being able to charge your phone through your controller while you're gaming just having to pair it every time you want to use it like not a huge deal Bluetooth is relatively good these days but I don't know is it worth paying an extra 30 bucks I'll leave that up to you guys okay are we in pairing mode man there's a little led oh that's the charging LED
I was expecting this to light up when I did no no no that's the one okay H turbo mode hold the button you would like to assign turbo functionality to then press the turbo button to enable turbo mode Auto turbo mode built in 300 Milah battery with 15 hours Play Time charging time of 1 hour that's weird that conflicts with my notes at say an hour and a half but whatever the point is that you'll be plugging it in for a little while to charge and wow that is it for instructions other than hey go to
8bit do.com to access the Ultimate Software V2 mobile version what should we start with this is Shredder's revenge right one slight oversight with the number of Android phones that have their speaker firing out the bottom I'd love to have seen like a little concave shape in the housing here you know here here here and here to kind of like route that sound towards your ear holes I mean me minor things maybe next version V2 V2 catch it in V2 remember how I said that I thought that this joystick was going
to interfere a little bit with the ABX y well it does you can see my thumbs like right on it like if you have bigger fingers and you're kind of coming in at these from the top then I doubt it's going to be a problem for you but I can't say I'm a huge fan no but you know what is yes the fact that absolutely nothing that's going badly has anything to do with my controller I just am this bad at the game wow I'm dead already I really like this obviously you're going to get a
little bit of extra latency when you're connecting via Bluetooth rather than with a wire but realistically for mobile gaming that's something you're just going to have to deal with most of the time anyway and there was nothing else about it that stood out to me as bad or insufficient I'd say if I had to nitpick I'm noticing that my device is lifting up a little bit from just sort of you know using it and moving around and kind of getting into the game it's kind of popping up a little bit on this side but
I doubt that it would manage to come up enough that it would manage to slip free and if it did it's pretty quick to pop it back down uh let's try let's try Crazy Taxi okay where's my backbone oh dude the ergonomics compared to the backbone night and day like I don't think I even need to tell you guys obviously the backbone's going to fit in into your bag a little bit better right it's got a 3 and half mm Jack so you can plug your headphones into it that's pretty cool it works with
the iPhone it's definitely got the 8bit dough controller beat when it comes to Features but in terms of the feel of the joysticks in terms of the layout in terms of the ergonomics it's not even close I wish there was a device that had everything both of them had uh maybe the gamer is the middle ground here your gamer yeah this has got way more desktop like ergonomics same buttons all o desktop grade joysticks and it does have device oh no it does not have device charging pass
through this one doesn't have it either oh man yeah so you're stuck with Bluetooth here too you can put a tablet in this thing though and the game Star is compatible with Apple devices it also has Hall joysticks and triggers and it has a gyro so you can use gyroscopic aim assist that's a pretty good option but it's not what we're making a video about today enter your age I don't want to I wasn't really a crazy taxi kid I didn't have a game console at this time in my life but what I can tell you guys even
though I'm not very good at this game is that these joysticks are freaking awesome I love them nice sensitivity no overly large dead zones I am into this I assure you that any deficiency in my driving skill is everything to do with my driving and nothing to do with these joysticks ah small dead zones they do have dead zones not zero dead zones but not ridiculous dead zones either why don't we try the 8bit do out Ultimate Software this is the Ultimate Software of ultimate Destiny well
um well what the software is supposed to do is allow you to adjust the triggers like I said before allow you to adjust the sticks like I said before and also adjust your button mapping which I haven't said before but right now because it's pre-release or beta or something it appears to do nothing blah blah blah blah blah okay oh oh do I need to do all the like button mapping nonsense oh wait if I don't have their app is this even going to work how do games like this not just support connected controllers by
default it's kind of mind-blowing to me that this isn't just plug andplay at this point like I I get it if you're an experienced mobile gamer you probably have a software that you really like for mapping this stuff and all that which is which is cool but it should probably just work at this point well that's annoying hopefully that's something that they can get sorted out because this is very much not working right now this is actually a really good thing to talk about because regardless
of which one of these style controllers you buy compatibility issues and configuration can be a bit of a pain in the butt to deal with in theory this is every bit as good a gaming experience as a dedicated handheld like a you know a switch light or whatever but in practice man it can be a bit of a chore you know like okay here's an annoying thing oh okay well I didn't put my phone in the way that it wants me to put my phone in so now I got to do this you know it's  that okay yeah well on that note good
