earbuds are great and compact but there's a reason why I'm always walking around with a big set of headphones I don't like the feeling of my ears being plugged and I get irritation from having stuff in my ears but there's something in between big bulky headphones and compact earbuds and that's open earbuds these don't go in your canals instead they sit outside of your ear like this the issue is that they can kind of sound like garbage but nothing thinks they figured it out with the ear open they
promise a great sound set of headphones that are also provide all of the benefits of open earbuds at the very least they look pretty dang cool uh there's a QR code of course it looks stylish and there is so going be like a USBC cable for charging and there is a nice short USBC cable and just in case you needed another USBC Cable in your life they got an instruction manual this might not be the most compact way to store these I'm kind of surprised they didn't go for like more of a nested
option even this feels like it's a little more pocketable I have pretty big Pockets but let's let's let's try are those the nothing buds or are you just Happ to see me a lot of the time you're going to end up with really bulky cases and this is might be actually nicer case is is plastic with a magnetic hinge it's got an indicator LED that will tell you the state for charging as well as for pairing and these are held in place by simple magnets and they connect to Pogo pin so pretty typical they look pretty
dang cool I still love the fact that they're going with the clear design like you can see the layers of pcbs which are really cool uh you can also kind of see the the driver in the back I will say one of the downsides of these is that they are white and the color of this white is going to be different than the color of the plastic white on the inner earbud quickly the ear hooks are a nice Soft Touch silicone they're not like firm metal though they just kind of have like some spring in them to go back but
they're not the kind of thing that you're going to shape and reposition that means you might have some issues with getting a good fit compared to firmer armed headphones honestly they're they're pretty comfortable and the nice thing is it feels like I don't have anything in my ears cuz I kind of don't as you can see they just sit in front of my beautiful ears people have always complimented me on my ears keep doing it in the comments below I also think wonder if these are going to be a
problem for glasses users they feel like they're going to fall off shake your head they're not yeah they're on there but it does feel very precarious yeah they claim 8 hours of battery life and this guy right here and with the case you get a total of 30 which is going to be plenty for pretty much any listening session that you'll be doing and if you need to do a quick little recharge it just takes 10 minutes to get 2 hours of playback time I think it's kind of funny how they've branded some things uh like
they call this open Sound technology just because it doesn't go in your ears which is honestly uh a benefit because people like cyclists often when they're on a commute they might want to have some music playing but they also need to be aware of their surroundings L they get hit by a car because we have gnarly bike infrastructure that doesn't allow cyclists to be safe not only not only do they have open Sound technology but you're also going to have sound seal technology because
you I don't get their sound seal technology is not actually a seal of any sort it's just a directional speaker that they've put in here apparently these are angled at a 50Â° angle so it tries to shoot basically straight into your ear canal so that this has a minimum amount of bother for people around you say if you're listening to these at your desk and you don't want to bug your co-workers or you have a very private phone call they say soundwaves at the front and the back back of the
bud cancel each other out I think that that probably means they're using some sort of active noise cancellation but we'll try and figure that out later but we're not going to be able to find out exactly what they mean until we talk about our sponsor MSI the weather might be getting colder but MSI is turning up the heat with some deals it's their fall sale event they've got deals on everything from entry-level gaming laptops to powerful AI capable machines for the gamers you can check out the MSI
Katana 15 it's great for running play titles without breaking the bank or if you need a productivity Powerhouse the MSI Prestige Series has you covered with the latest AI capable processors these deals are spicier than the pumpkin spice latte that you're probably sipping right now so check out msi's fall Ready ha sale using the link in the video description let's get listening I want to check this out cuz if I open them like this do they just do the auto pairing thing hey okay sweet they got
that the Quick Connect that is awesome on Android feels like magic oh it's a pinch mechanism single pinch play pause answer and hangup calls double pinch skip forward decline incoming call Triple pinch skip back pinch and hold right volume up left volume down that's all we're in the app and they got an equalizer which I love to see you can use your band equalizer you can use you can set custom frequencies that's so nice so many equalizers are like you just get what you get you get 12 bands
and you don't have any say oh you can even adjust the Q factor which controls the shape of your curve I'm going to set them to default so that I don't screw anything up but that's great I'm so happy that they actually uh implemented like a fully featured equalizer no one else does this and then you still have simple if you if you aren't super picky which is amazing this it's that easy it's that easy everybody should be doing this especially brands that have a background in high-end audio
Sennheiser doesn't do this focal doesn't do this Sony doesn't do this nothing's actually listening to what the Nerds want looking through it if you tap them you can see all of the different controls you can modify the controls I wish that you could modify every part of the controls they do limit certain options depending on it so like the double pinch can only be skipped backwards skip forward and voice AI which apparently is you get chat GPT with these I appreciate the level of
customization and you can also see your case power and your headphone battery power they also have a low latency mode which gets the latency below 12 120 milliseconds which is like not really that impressive it's better than uh being above 120 milliseconds uh that's for sure thanks to having Bluetooth 5.3 you get all of those features as well as potential future features like orac cast but don't buy anything based on future features enough about the app let's just take a listen ah yes Library the only
album in here Seas of cheese by Primus can you hear what I'm listening to I cannot or is it directed directly into my ears can you hear it no I can't hear anything I can't hear you I'm too let me turn it down a little First Impressions is they sound pretty good but there's something that is really really important and that's that that even just slight adjustments to how these are positioned on your ears will have a massive effect on the sound the difference between this and this is a
noticeable change in sound and you're probably going to do that just from adjusting for comfort so your experience and my experience listening could vary massively just because of the shapes of our ears so remember that fact as we go into the testing numbers that we got from our friends at headphones.com thanks guys starting at the low end of our frequency response chart you can see that there's very little subbase and that's basically the consequence of just not having a good seal however as you
get up to the 100 HZ region you have a decent Basse response and I agree it's enough to get the job done to communicate most of the sound that you're going to be hearing from instruments and it does a great job in the mid-range but that tinniness that I mentioned kind of pops up and you can see that in these peaks in the high end around 5 khz and 9 khz it uh ends up making a little bit of a bright sound that they can make it sound a little cheap and maybe even irritating if you
have particular sensitivities to frequencies in those ranges basically this is the kind of shape that we'd expect from headphones like these though you can see that there's a lot of variants across the different testing they did the purple line is going to be the average of all the tests the gray lines are the recordings from each individual test thankfully they did include that really in-depth equalizer so you could tailor this to sound the best for you but you're probably not
ever going to have any real success in with the subbase for me these sound I would say good maybe they're a little Hollow in the top end a little tiny decent Basse response that is until you turn the volume up and there's a point where they just can't add more base and the only thing that they add is more treble which in the context of you're trying to use these out and about or in a louder area and maybe you're trying to take a call that's okay because you're going to hear the details of speech but
it just music at the top volume just sounds bad when you have a nice tight seal it is easier to produce good Bas frequencies that's why closed back headphones and say airpods Pro will have a better base response on something that doesn't seal like airpods normal or these Let's test those claims about privacy and sound leakage uh B you want to come over here 30% volume but it's we're not in the main part of the song we're just going to wait a little bit we'll skip to the lyrics I can hear a
little bit but nothing I you make out what the song is I couldn't make out what song it is okay I'm going to turn  you know this song yeah if I was sitting next on the bus I wouldn't be upset like it's not that loud but here's the thing is that it's not very loud in my ears like if I if I was on the bus I don't know if I would be able to really hear much over the sound of the bus cuz if I get louder that's when I get to the point where the bass drops off and now it's and now it's just like it doesn't
sound very good I can hear everything very clearly now this is a test recording of the nothing ear open I hope they sound good if I go s huh right or how do they sound let me know overall what do I think I think that if you are somebody looking for a pair of open earbuds these are a good option I appreciate the features that they pack they also are rated for ip54 Ingress Protection so pretty nice you could wear them when your work out 150 bucks I think there really are something
that you need to try I would not give a recommendation because everyone's ears are shaped different these might not be the product for you are they a bad value absolutely not I think they're a pretty decent product for what they are but do not blindly buy them and throw away the receipt but you know what you can throw away the receipt on this video cuz it's over if you like this video why don't you check out our coverage on the shocks headphones
