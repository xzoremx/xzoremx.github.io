over a year ago at CES I saw the Ola G9 and it was incredible but it's expensive gigabytes here to maybe fill that Gap with the co 49 DQ and I've got to say it is enormous this thing wouldn't even fit in my back seat my car ignore the Do Not Open from this side we packed it up this way so it should come out just fine one of the problems with curved is that these boxes are so freaking deep on the one hand it's great they come with a three-year warranty on the other hand you've got to find somewhere to keep
this box for three freaking years just in case it breaks down we've got our Factory calibration report got the base of our stand got the other part of her stand the column uh one thing to note is they are using the nice double column design because it's a 49 in display 32 by9 this thing is enormous it's going to need all the support it can get as for the cables to come in the box we've got HDMI 2.1 ultra high speed DP 1.4 C13 power cable USB B to a but now oh oh my God it's so big I should
just click clack it's going in it wants  it it's enormous if you couldn't already  100 R curve to help protect in shipping they've got a really nice peel that we already peeled off to do all our testing really nice you're not going to get any micros scratches I've never seen any micr scratching from the little foam that comes on top of a display but people complain about it online so I don't know what they're doing but the screen film will definitely protect it as for the stand it's not bad it's got
that base swivel that I personally prefer and it's actually got quite a bit for a monitor of this size I wasn't expecting this much swivel and then we've got some tilt and I'm not even going to try to Pivot it it's not going to happen I can tell from the stand it's not going to happen and I don't think anyone's going to be pivoting this thing to go to portrait mode it can't you can't do it it's not meant to do that bill it is not meant to do that as for I/O it's going to be a little tough cuz it's so dang
big we've got our c14 power connector here and then on the other side oh it's nice and labeled for us that's always a plus it's got a headphone jack two h HDMI 2.1 ports display port 1.4 uh We've also got our usbb port for connecting to your computer uh for any peripherals or firmware updates you might want to do as well as uh two USB 3.2 type A overall Design's pretty decent we've also got pretty minimal branding but it is a little cringe like team up fight on I don't know if they need to tell me that
but I do love how hidden the aurus logo is even though it's on the back of the monitor that you're not going to be looking at too frequently there's only one more thing to do we got to plug it in and turn it on but not before a word from our sponsor thanks rocket money for sponsoring this video rocket money is the personal finance app that helps you cancel subscriptions lower bills and manage your money better they securely break down what everyone's taking from you every month and then helps you track

displays have been hitting 240 plus Hertz recently which is fantastic and "they're getting that 13,000 clear Mr" rating from Vasa it is still OLED but because it's down to the 140 before "we're only going to get the 8,000 rating" which is still really good and better than most other gaming monitors but uh it's a minor point that you might care about you're not going to get 200 and plus Hertz on this thing uh but what you are going to get is basically two 16x9 displays at
1440p which is just so weird I've never been a fan of 32 by9 uh for me it's just too much screen all in one place but some people love of the whole idea of using like picture in picture or picture by picture and making like one side of the screen for your game and then one side of the screen for whatever else you want to do maybe Discord or twitch or maybe you're taking notes maybe you're in class I don't know I'm not going to judge now this display mode setting is a little weird it's either full or aspect
the reason that's important is because if you hook up a console to this they don't support Ultra wide and so if you go full it's just going to stretch the whole image across and maybe someone out there likes that I don't think you should so keep it on aspect if you want it to be correct pip baby so I want PBP I want picture by picture whoa that's great so now what we need to do though if you want to take advantage of this if is you have to either plug in a separate device or you have to plug in uh another
HDMI cable to your computer so that it's sending two different signals to the different parts of the display if you're just tuning in now it looks broken because the screen is pure black it's probably got a bit of that magenta tinge cuz it's QE OLED we've got studio lights blasting on this thing I don't know what to tell you guys as soon as you take it into your home and you're just in like wherever as long as you don't have full sun Windows blasting on it it looks fine but this is short circuit not long
circuit so we're going to just play it the way nature intended at sweet sweet 32 by9 the nice thing about that instead of using two separate displays is you've always got bezels right so if if you've got two monitors side by side you're going to have that weird bezel in between if you go with the PBP method boom now it's just perfect nothing in the way I don't think I want anything else here right now so let's let's game Doom is fantastic and that it will play basically any aspect ratio you want it
to look at the Dual up video it was weird it was like 4 by three or so I can't remember what the aspect ratio was  amazing okay let's make sure it's all set to being pretty   dumb um Ultra sure apply one of the problems you notice with ultra wide is that uh look not everything is built for ultrawide so we've got this nice splash screen here but it only goes to here and then this UI since the UI is probably being told to just like draw on the left and that one's probably just draw on the
right on the extremes as much as I love Ultra wide when it works perfectly when it doesn't it just kind of looks weird and wrong and it can be hard to get the hang of it this feels good though oh my God it's like my entire peripheral vision is full just perfectly perfectly full is 21 by9 just not good enough and so you want 32x 9 cuz 21 by9 just gives you a taste while still maintaining all the of those bugs I was talking about whereas like this is just right in my face like I cannot get over how cool
this looks right now especially with OLED and HDR like yeah it's only 144 Herz but because of those instant pixel response times from OLED it looks really crispy but you know we know Doom looks good what about the other HDR content one thing that is kind of weird about this guy is our Peak brightness is only lists at 456 nits from uh Windows which is usually correct but what we found is that it will do a th000 however you're going to have to change some things so in our regular HDR mode it's not in the
setting OSD it's not in here so what you're going to have to do is go out and then we got to go to APL stabilize so ours is already set to high because we've been doing some testing but it will default to Middle out of the box and so you've got to set this to high or "you're not going to get 1,000 nits we" should see that even though Windows is stating 456 to the naked eye this all looks pretty good it's very Vivid it's very colorful but while we were testing it we noticed something pretty
interesting the HDR accuracy is actually not very good at all some of the worst I've ever seen to be perfectly honest however when you're just looking at it in person unless you have something that is perfect or close to it right next to it you're not really going to be able to tell maybe if you're a purist or a colorist or you're just really really good at looking at displays um but frankly even looking at this AR footage knowing that it's not accurate it looks pretty good to me we noticed especially
in Resident Evil 4 that it just kind of over brightens everything way too much and so you'll have let's say a car truck lights pointed somewhere and they're pointed way off here Leon's standing over here so he should just be kind of like soft lit by them but he's not he looks like the lights are shining directly on him and unless you've got the game running simultaneously on two different displays you're really not going to notice you're just going to think oh it's kind of right but for a
game like Resident Evil that wants to be moody and dark it doesn't all of a sudden look all that Moody and dark anymore so I think it's perfectly fine for the vast majority of people I think it's still going to look good but that can be a huge deciding factor for some of you out there it's not going to technically be accurate when it comes to HDR content as for SDR content it's not so bad we measured an average of 1.5 however once we check our maximum it's all the way up at 9 .1 so we found that
Blues are just kind of UND saturating and then Reds are being pulled out a little too much so again it's like it looks good and most people aren't really going to notice especially when the average is so low but a Discerning customer might be a little more picky as for color gamut it's pretty decent it's QD OLED so we've got 99% coverage of P3 and then a whopping 82% of BT 2020 which is strong it's great now let's talk price monitors have have been coming down in price quite a bit recently and
"this guy retails for 1,300 bucks I know" that's still a lot of money but the thing is just a few years ago OLED 32 by9 49 in 144 Herz like this thing would have been 2 three grand easy if not even more than that the only problem is that "currently the OLED G9 would be $1,100 on" sale obviously sales change all the time "so who knows whether that $1,100 that" the G9 is going for is going to stay right maybe it goes away and comes back frequently throughout the year I don't know but what I can say is that if
you're picking between the two displays and that's the price go with the G9 if you're not and it's an MSRP this does look pretty compelling "for 1,300 bucks since filming the" pricing of the orus monitor has dropped to "$1,100 if you can't get the G9 on sale" this is a pretty solid price Point thanks for watching that's short circuit this is the gigabyte Co 49 DQ if you want to look at another very similar panel check out the Samsung OLED G9
