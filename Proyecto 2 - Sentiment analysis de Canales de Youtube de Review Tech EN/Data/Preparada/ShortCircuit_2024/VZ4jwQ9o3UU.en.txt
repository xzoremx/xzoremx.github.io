drones have come a long way since I first started talking about them back at NCI you know there's big ones now you need the certifications you need to go train and go to school for 5 years just to fly them near an airport you're not supposed to fly but hover sponsored this video to prove to all of you that it doesn't have to be that complicated this is the hover camera X1 it is a very light drone it's 125 G which means that it's under the 250 g threshold that requires you in the US and Canada to get
certification to fly a drone do I need to look at the quick start guide no I don't it's supposed to be easy to use I don't need to read the quick start guide but I probably should look at it at least this card it seems useful yeah this is I'm I'm excited about this one you're just supposed to hold it horizontally in uh the palm of your hand and then I believe that you press the button and there's a 3second takeoff we that's going to be exciting I want to see that disclaimer and safety
instructions I'll have my my people read that okay what else we got oh we got a little box here with uh some treats ooh ooh a nice bag there's nothing in the bag because I think that's to hold the actual uh drone itself a charging cable USBC to usba um okay that's everything in the Box let's take a look at the Drone itself man it is a very small boy hey there have been of course many small drones over the years uh but this is interesting to see this foldable design and presumably it fits in that bag I
looked at earlier let's take a look at what is on the outside so on the top here we've got the power and takeoff button there's the mode button which switches modes not sure what the modes are right now but I know that there are five flight paths that you can switch  Fly and then there are five LED indicators surrounding that which I guess you know will give you a visual representation of what mode you're in when you're not using the app on this side we have what looks like the
USBC charging port on the other side not much but I did also not mention this is the battery here which is directly replaceable um we have the charging Hub here with an extra battery and uh oh and there's two slots for that and each one of these batteries will give you 11 minutes of flight time thankfully you got two batteries here you can swap them out and keep going for another 11 minutes and the fun times keep on flying I just want to do this all day this is just fun it looks like it's clapping for
me good job Riley we got the gimbal camera here with some o some jiggly stabilizing uh mechanisms there it can shoot 2.7k at 30 FPS or 1080p at 60 or 1080p at HDR so we'll take a look at what that looks like and on the bottom we've got our downward facing sensor array this drone actually has a Time oflight laser positioning system here as well as Vio technology which means that it uses a camera and deep learning technology to see where it's going just with a visual system instead of like
relying on a bunch of sensors and GPS so that's interesting we'll see how well that plays out okay let's pair it with the app and then take it outside let's have some fun who we we've picked up a signal on the radar on on the sonar Captain should I hail them press and hold the power button on the hover until the status indicator turns solid green oh I like this display oh current mode hover done it's connected before starting your flight pick up hover and follow me please complete eight tasks
are you ready please confirm that the status light turns green hover is ready to fly oh I didn't see this this warning the first time do not fly in the following environments low light situation the ground texture is not clear and it has a picture of like a smooth floor so if your floors are too clean water surface don't fly it over water and large height variants and it shows buildings please hold hover in your palm horizontally and align the camera to your face hi use the other hand to short
press the power button I'm holding my phone with the other hand short press not long  continue oh I didn't okay I didn't think it was going to go right away the red light indicates filming is in progress I didn't give you permission but okay strike a pose once you've been still for  you did you take the photo or oh okay it did after shooting place your palm directly under the hover and wait for  land it feels safe with me I've already bonded after the propeller shut off the
flight is officially completed and we can all go home but now there's also now there's these other icons in the app sound recording Link account hovers album oh I can see the picture I got it okay here's the oh wow it took a bunch of it took a bunch of photos so that was cool but now I want to see what it's capable of all right now I understand there are six icons on the top because there five of those are the flight paths that you can switch between and then the sixth one is custom I guess
you can make a custom one which I'm not going to do you can also change modes in the app as well I mean it says here hover zoom out follow orbit bird's eye oh and then there's extra ones but those are those are there's the basic ones and then there's the skilled ones ones snapshot Dolly track manual control the cartoon character in this app is hilarious what is it he's got his legs up behind his head what so let's go through the flight modes then um let's start with whatever this one is
hover oh it tells you what zoom out follow follow orbit orbit bird eye bird eye yeah so it it follows me around my Mansion but it doesn't fall it won't it'll stay there because it knows its place and then if you just stick your hand out it just comes right down man I feel like I've known this little guy for  out whoa now is it recording Rec in right  me there's nothing for you out there in the world you belong with me it'll always come back the prodigal drone okay okay and then if you want to
actually watch the video you have to download it that's interesting it would be really nice if the process to see the file that you just the video that you just recorded was a bit quicker right now it's downloading from the Drone onto the phone it has to download and process before you can just watch it so that could be a bit quicker it was only a 5-second video okay so there are settings in the app for uh changing like how long it's going to zoom out and come back or how long it's going to record
for all right let's try the next mode follow just like we practiced little   come on don't look at them this way yes yes you're doing great you're doing it Peter I called him Peter Marcus have you ever seen such an amazing thing in your life is it going to keep following you though yeah now it's yours he's he's on you now okay R just go just go you're free now go don't you get it I you can't stay with me go okay we're in orbit now let's go over here   listened okay now what if what if I don't go get
it it's kind of coming it's like Daddy Daddy pick me up what if I don't what's it going to do oh it just it just has like a breakdown it's just like I don't know what to do now I see that was like I felt cruel there making it hover the last one of the five modes bird eye bird eye okay what do I I don't know what you're going to do this is going to be a surp rprise wait no I'm not ready oh okay wow it's going is it going to stop and come back oh it's already it's already
coming back I got to say there's a part of me that's like ah it's a bit gimmicky but there's a maybe a bigger part that's like this is really cool it's like it's cool how intuitive it is I just held my hand out and it's just like yes Father I'm like I already have a son let's let's just calm down oh okay so you can set it to record for 30 seconds or 60 seconds or five minutes or just continue which I guess means that like keep recording until I tell you to shut up you should be able to tell that the
audio is actually coming from the phone and not the Drone the phone and not the Drone and that's because if the microphone was on the Drone you wouldn't you just hear a buzz so look at it oh it's far away can you hear me can you hear me can you hear me can you hear me can you do you see what I'm doing uh if you switch to Vertical video mode you're limited to uh 1080p 30 FPS but the option is there if you like want to post a social or something I guess oh you think you can follow me we'll have to    
you've done well okay we're back inside uh I want to take a look at some of this footage uh because you know that was very exciting out there it was a challenging situation as David points out with the lighting uh you know it was basically things were blown out with the sun in the background and there was harsh Shadows but it seems to be doing a really good job I mean like obviously the the sky is blown out but the color and the detail are pretty impressive for you know a tiny little drone camera it
did a really fun like edit adding music and taking screenshots during the video so I can always forever remember the setup process for the Drone oh I'm going to put that right beside my kids photos this is interesting for some of the modes I couldn't tell this while I was actually using the Drone but now I can see it records for like like the first bit of the motion and then it stops and then records again as it as it comes back it did that for the bird's eye mode and for the zoom out mode so I mean you
might be able to change that in settings though CU they did have some settings for like changing uh specific settings of different modes I got to say as I'm watching these I'm reminded of the time when we were just outside 2 seconds ago and it was uh my impression of this drone overall pretty good like there's not a ton that I have to complain about here other than the you know oh I want to see the things that I just recorded I have to download them off the Drone and have them download and then process and
then they're available to watch but like you wouldn't expect the a small drone like this to have the type of Wi-Fi equipment that you could like stream high quality video to your phone directly from it um so you know I kind of forgive that because the rest of the experience using it was I didn't have I mean I didn't have any complaints when I was done with it I just put my hand out and it landed immediately so if the hover camera X1 is something you're interested in they actually have a combo
right now that's on sale you get the Drone and the battery charger and an extra battery for 445 but it's on sale for $3.99 so if you're interested in that uh check the link in the description and thanks to hover for sponsoring this video hey thanks for watching that was a short circuit uh appreciate appreciate you staying the end so we can have this little moment uh subscribe to the channel um if you feel like it make me happy but
