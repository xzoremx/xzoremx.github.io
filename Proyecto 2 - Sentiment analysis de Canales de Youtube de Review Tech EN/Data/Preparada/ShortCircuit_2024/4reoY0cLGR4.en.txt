I never had a Game Boy as a kid meaning I missed out on an entire era of handheld gaming but that's okay there's time thanks to the funny playing fpga build your own Game Boy kit now the whole concept of this product is a little confusing to me since apparently it's so easy to build that you can just do it yourself and yet they don't want to do it they do not offer the option to pre-assemble it and ship it to you but realistically I'm pretty technical and I'm sure that I can figure out how to get
the okay I I I I'm I'm Hamming it up I'm Hamming it up calm down I can open a bag oo this is a perfect opportunity to show off our upcoming Precision screwdriver kit for lonus coming soon to LTT store.com let's have a look at everything that's included in our kit we've got the Game Boy case which comes in clear or black or apparently a variety of other colors but those are the two that we got and I chose clear and obviously this is not a Game Boy this is a Game Boy Color shell but it
will apparently play both Game Boy and Game Boy Color games got some Hardware got a funny playing 3.7 volt lithium battery this Pro is probably a screen apparently it is significantly brighter than the original not backlit Game Boy Color screen I'm actually going to save that peel until later these are the membranes and these are the buttons they apparently strongly recommend trying it out before assembly which I guess makes sense that's something we can do and then we've got the main board itself
this is the star of the show featuring contact pads for all of our buttons on the face and coming around to the back an fpga processor that makes this not so much an emulation machine more of an actual Game Boy SL Game Boy Color because fpga is short for field programmable Gat array and on a hardware level this chip can mimic the functionality of those devices not emulating them in software but becoming them which is incredibly cool given the price that this comes in at a little
over $80 for everything that you see in front of you uh not including the Precision driver kit honestly even if I had a game boy or a Game Boy Color this would be very attractive to me because all of a sudden I can charge with USBC not to mention apparently the speakers are quite a lot better where are they ah yes speaker sorry did I say speaker cuz I meant speaker now something to note is unlike a console console you're not going to get the same kind of standby battery life our friends
over at retro gamecore found that they lost about 50% of the remaining battery being in standby for just 8 hours and their suspicion is that is because the game is still running in the background albeit at a lower power mode we've got a couple more ports here we've got our volume rocker as well as our EXT Port which I guess if you were one of the very few people I didn't know anyone who had one if you were one of the very few people that had one of those link cables you could could they use it for
multiplayer games you could definitely share Pokemon with it and I never knew anyone who did that we got our power switch over here our game cartridge slot it takes both Game Boy and Game Boy Color modes and can emulate each of those consoles separately and that's worth noting because even though you could run Game Boy games in a Game Boy Color it would behave slightly differently in some cases and now I think it's time to go ahead and put this thing together I'm thinking I'll just
like kind of what start at the front here and uh hopefully I don't screw this up too badly is this keyed oh yeah look at that it's keyed you can't you can't screw it up oh yeah look at that can only be assembled one way this is going great I hope now we're going to put the funny playing speaker in here any particular orientation they want for this or I'll figure it out don't tell me don't tell me is there a cover on this thing why'd you put a cover on there funny playing you guys funny playing
with me I think I've got everything in it's time to screw this I've screwed it in oh yeah can he assemble the whole thing while it acts as a fidget spinner nope I'm going to need the spinny top oh that's kind of cool so the IR emitter is optional and I guess we don't have it right so I'll just I don't know I can put either one of them in it doesn't matter I'm going to put the clear one in why are some of these screws triwing dang it funny playing we don't like that about Nintendo don't
copy that okay wait a second hold on whoo there are a lot of really different screws here what is this long Phillips head that I put in here oh dude did I just drive that through the entire oh boy okay now I got this i got this no it didn't drive all the way through it just left a mark let's just put the battery and what could go wrong right now so those two go through the shell I'm going to say the tri WIS go through the back of the chassis here and I'm going to say the three Phillips
heads go anywhere where there isn't a hole in the back of the chassis we got good we good oh well that's fine cuz the battery just sits in here anyway there's even a little recessed thing for it this is totally fine oh man I was all oh no I'm going to have to like put the battery here and there's going to be a screw sticking into it no this is great yeah guys I mean okay yeah sure the instructions might be nice if they were a thing that existed but realistically if you're reasonably Savvy or if you
watch this video you could probably put this together for yourself you guys believe that both Belle who's sitting here producing for this video and Andrew who's shooting it are skipping our land I bet if you worked here you wouldn't skip the land what kind of person is like that even our CEO tan is coming to the land you're not coming to the land what a dick that's the problem with Executives they think they're too good to mingle with us common people there we go tighten this boy up oh yeah okay make 
o makes sense that would uh make sense that that would power it on I just want to see this screen power on before I put in the rest of the screws and commit here ah okay cool you're the lift up at the back style the little uh little black part there you just give that a little lifty lift without touching the actual PCV with any metal and then this boy I already peeled the adhesive on it so I assume it's going to go in a little something like that I'm not going to lie I was kind of expecting it to um do some
oh hey there was no game in it I figured it out and that's going to come off little something like that a s I just built a Game Boy I am qualified to work at Nintendo's Factory in the year 1983 wait who brought this video to you oh it must have been our sponsor jlcpcb thanks to jlc PCB for sponsoring this video If you're looking to customize or even create your own Game Boy motherboard jlc PCB is the perfect place to order your pcbs they offer One-Stop services including PCB

Kirby's Dreamland this is the one game boy game that I actually have hours in oh let's do this thing wow the um Game Boy to Game Boy Color experience uh leaves a lot to be desired doesn't it  ooh different display modes okay this is pretty cool you can adjust how it scales so right now we're using x 4 integer scaling but we can also stretch it if we don't want as uh true of a representation you know what I'm stretching it I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry purists out there uh we can just switch
to the Game Boy core that's probably for the best right now okay backl oh man this is sick get all my little adjustments in here frame mix and GB color fix are apparently fixes if your game doesn't work properly then you can kind of try that and then the speed can be adjusted you can update the firmware just by plugging in Via USBC and just dragging a new firmware file over which is pretty freaking cool and I never showed you guys the headphone jack at the bottom before so let's go ahead I'm
going to switch to Game Boy mode waa it's even green Ah that's so cool ah ah no no don't I'm going to die okay let's try Game Boy Color game and you want to compare to an actual Game Boy Color right wow I forgot how small and crappy that screen was H how's a d-pad compare I mean this poor thing is like 25 years old so so yeah it's pretty mushy this is definitely better AB buttons feel pretty similar start select buttons a little better on the original the ergonomics match very closely it's clear that
Nintendo's Plastics are a little better even after all of these years just things match up a little bit better but man yeah USBC versus this stupid GC Barrel Port here do we have another Game Boy Color game yeah we got we got something let's just throw this in here just to just to show you guys cuz this was not even a backlit display like it's color but it's a reflective LCD like man you want to play your old Game Boy Color games ew no question this is awesome yeah let's go to I don't know world six
sure I got this don't even trip dog speakers are pretty sick on this actually it's always a good sign when we get distracted playing video games compared to wa that's really loud the whole chassis vibrates man I'm going to beat one level okay that's all I ask what he moved up game over no no no I don't rage I  ah all right let's have a look at a more premium option the analog pocket oh hey it's worth mentioning that compatibility with flash carts is somewhat limited on this one you got to make sure you get
one that works with it uh what we suspect it's due to power constraints or something like that possibly I don't think we know exactly why that is but just watch out for that if you're planning to use Flash carts as opposed to to using actual games like a good little boy like we do this is a really nice display and it's nice to have the extra size whatever my wife might say it really does make a difference it's really heavy though really freaking heavy this is actually the first time
I've used this thing it's like I know it's kind of like a big deal device and all that what we can all agree on is that this is terrible okay and either of these or basically anything is much better let's talk value the analog pocket is obviously our premium option it gets more battery life it's got a bigger screen the build quality feels noticeably more robust and it's more powerful not just playing game boy and Game Boy Color games but also playing other retro console games hence the uh
four button layout compared to the two button layout of our funny playing however it costs now what's that work out too it costs well over twice the amount at over $200 compared to this thing being around 85 yeah you got to build it yourself but I think I just showed you guys you can probably do that in anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes depending on your level of skill now where the Game Boy Color comes in is around 60 around 60 us why would anybody ever buy this then okay so just don't do
that yeah there's no way that I would consider this and honestly unless I really wanted the flexibility of playing those other consoles I just don't see how I would take a device that's this big and this heavy compared to how pocketable this is yeah this flipping awesome just make sure you get a compatible multi card if you're um a filthy pirate see you later subscribe to Short Circuit
