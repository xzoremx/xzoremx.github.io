One X player first showed up on my radar when they had the gaming handheld that was much bigger than anyone else's and it seems like they are taking one more step in their Journey towards a TV with giant controllers on the side of it with the 1X player X1 that's right my friends this is a handheld gaming PC how big are your hands people look I'm allowed to make small hands jokes how dare you censor me editor ooh ah it's heavy it's funny for me because my wife just picked up Dave the
diver on our RG Ally and even at that size every time I look at her she's got it firmly planted against something to ensure that her arms don't get fatigued with this thing you'd have to be Dwayne The Rock Johnson to be able to actually hold this in front of you and game on it for an extended period of time look look at this I accidentally dropped it in a previous take and it freaking destroyed the pack in here we find the charger which is a 100 W charger it supports USB power
delivery up to 20 volts and comes with a not really satisfactorily long USBC cable I'd like to see this a little bit on the longer side maybe more like 5 ft realistically we saw as much as 6 hours of battery life on this thing in our endurance test but as little as just over an hour in our torture test so depending on your configuration you're probably going to be gaming for about 2s hour is and change and then you're going to want to be plugged into the wall while you use it guess better buy
yourself a fancy USB cable one of the big controversies maybe not controversy but certainly something for you to consider around this device is that it uses Intel's core Ultra 7 155h which has six high performance cores can be paired with up to 64 gigs of lpddr 5x memory up to 4 terab of storage and in every configuration Intel arc graphics we're going to get into performance a little bit more later first let's take a look at the accessories because this is not just a handheld with 1 x player making
this keyboard accessory available which I guess makes the screen size make a lot more sense like if this thing's half gaming handeld half whoo it's kind of like a like a little mini surface that's pretty cool of course the keyboard is optional so we'll take a closer look at that later first I want to see the definitely non-infringing  controllers First Impressions not bad they've got a bit of a soft touch feel to them but the Finish is just plastic so you won't have to worry about them
turning all gross and sticky over time H there were some notes from the lab about how the abxy buttons felt kind of weird like it's a micro switch at the bottom but there's an awful lot of to travel I see it it feels kind of like a rubber Dome that collapses and then it hits a micro switch Yeah it's a bit of a weird mushy feeling I wouldn't say that it bothers me but I'm not a fan of that kind of configuration for something like a d-pad and it feels like they Ed the exact same
switches one thing that some folks will appreciate though is the use of these full-sized Alps gaming grade which I guess means they have RGB joysticks and the inclusion of a rear button that you can remap to whatever you need triggers feel good shoulders feel all right let's have a look at the attachment mechanism hold on just a gosh darn a second here so you pull off this which is going to get lost immediately and then you put this on and it interferes with your micro SD
slot that's kind of a drag also here is a usb3 type A which is definitely a welcome addition if you're going to be using this thing as an actual laptop up top we've got a turbo button which I will definitely be trying out later ventilation hole this is actually a really nice aluminum chassis the thing feels while heavy definitely wellb built an oculink Port super cool so that's PCI gen 4x4 and if you have a compatible dock that means you can run an egpu without some of the well hassle that can
be associated with Thunderbolt although without some of the convenience of Thunderbolt meaning it's not going to be hot pluggable we've got a 3 1/2 mm headphone jack back and oh that's curious they reversed the typical position of volume up and volume down I would expect volume up to be on the right here's our power button does that have a built-in fingerprint sensor it does nice on the left we've got two USBC no way did they really put yeah they did there's no way you're
getting any real actual cable plugged into that bottom one not the end of the world because at least it does have one that's accessible but I can't say that I'm a huge fan then at the bottom we've got a dock interface for the detachable keyboard man that's that's kind of weird it feels like oh it does come off this intake is accounted for in the back cover this appears to be an intake but is not accounted for the only other thing to see back here is the Harmon branding they've apparently worked with
Harmon to tune the audio on this thing to I'm sorry I'm having a hard time taking this seriously at this point now this is hilarious as comical as it might look and as heavy as the device might be though the controllers managed to feel pretty solid there's definitely a little bit more play in the left one compared to the one on the right but either one I would consider to be acceptable is not the sort of thing that I would notice over an extended period of time and what's not comical at all is the sheer
expansiveness of this thing kind of like it it's freaking huge not only that but this display kind of sick 2560 x600 so that's a 16x 10 aspect ratio really nice pixel density it manages to achieve even better than the 540 nits of peak brightness that they rate it for and it manages 99% coverage of the P3 color gamut while being reasonably accurate especially if you enable the compensation within windows that doesn't work great on all devices but does work well on this one and all of that and it
runs at 120 HZ now the arc GPU in here might struggle to run games at that kind of refresh rate and resolution but hey don't let me tell you let me show you after this message from our sponsor magic spoon most of the cereals you find on the store shelf these days are loaded with sugar not magic spoon their health conscious cereals have 0 gram of sugar 13 to 14 g of protein and only four to 5 net GS of carbs per serving you can build your own variety box with flavors that are reminiscent of your favorite

being right here makes it kind of a CH to press it unless you're really adjusting the ergonomics and on something like a Nintendo switch that's no problem because the thing's so light you can kind of hold it however you want here you really got to hold on to this thing and I'm I'm not a big fan of that a position like I'm not exaggerating if I if I want to press this with this part of my thumb I mean you might have bigger hands so your mileage may vary but not a fan when I have my hands covering the
controller it doesn't look quite as ridiculous if anything it looks great I mean it's almost an 11in display this is basically the equivalent of sitting like yeah this distance from a Flippin 65 in TV but when you see the controllers like yeah look at him   family work Freedom life that is so cool I'm keeping her there forever okay we have a pretty close family friend who's deaf and whenever I see my family and I'm talking to her she like does the equivalent of signing like this for me like thank you
Danielle cuz I can't understand you otherwise I'm I'm pretty slow I'm Rusty it's just funny because an audible version of that would be like bondor lus this is running a lot better than I expected after all the issues that I've heard about with the core Ultra 7 155h not to mention the ones that I experienced on the early drivers when I was checking out the MSI clot CES I was expecting a lot more of that kind of um it almost feels like rubber banding because the frame rate will drop and
then go up and then drop and then go up oh H okay that was more of just a stutter but kind of like that actually it looks like they've improved a lot since then but one of in's big problems with their Arc Alchemist generation gpus is inconsistency from one game to the next one game will run great and another one will be dog shite in fact one of our games returnal we weren't even able to include in our results because the physics in the game went all wonky Intel says they're working on this but we
don't have an ETA for the fix actually what I was playing around with right now was the joysticks basically very little in the way of dead zones they advertise nothing essentially and while I'm sure there is is something I'm not able to detect it usually I'm pretty sensitive to them too I'm really good driver as long as I don't have dead zones you can see that right God this display though man that's sick it's not even cranked woo Look at Her Go wow no HDR support mind you but SDR
looks absolutely flipping awesome I bet you'd even be able to play outside with this thing I really like these joysticks One X player doesn't say specifically on the product page if they're hall effect but they feel really good let's take a short gaming break and have a look at some of 1x player's software which in the past for me has been a weak point of their systems against competitors like the Ally which one is their software this oh there it is nice do we have a shortcut for
it the you hit the turbo button you hit the turbo button God I pressed everything okay this is bad let's start over shall we turbo button perfect there's the software we're in the 35 watt mode M that could explain part of why the performance doesn't suck because it was especially more moderate tdps that the claw was suffering the last time that I looked at it that and 35 watts is a lot you're not going to get a ton of battery life out of that typically I'm going to be using
my devices in more like the 15 watt range unless I'm really trying to get maximum performance in which case yeah you might go up to about 30 fan mode is automatic curiously we found that it tracks with the igp U temperature rather than with the package temperature so that's good for gaming and that you can be running a game and pretty much immediately the fan will kick in like Jake's car but it can be kind of unfortunate in that you can have a Windows update running in the background
using 20% 25% of the CPU and your temps will Spike and the fan will just stay idle almost this is nice being able to change the reported resolution of the display there you go can't decide whether I'd go for 1920 x 1200 or 1280 by 800 that is that is not a lot of pixels at this size you'd probably have to go with 1920 x 1200 why don't we have a look at the keyboard case now it's worth noting that this is a prototype unit and not fully representative of the final quality One X player went out of
their way to say hey don't judge the keyboard too harshly this is pretty early and we're going to have a pinned comment if the final version that they sent us is markedly different but it at least gives us a chance to have a look at what the ergonomics of the setup will look like with the keyboard trackpad attachment piece feels like such a monstrosity look at this it's hilarious especially with the controller still attached to it let's go ahead and get our rivit tuner
thing set up okay that's a pretty stiff click I can see what the labs was talking about on the trackpad wow that's really stiff okay  try I mean there's some give but this is  improvements this is definitely a uh thick tablet computer handheld thing oh guys that's why the volume rockers like that it's a tablet we'll turn the auto rotate on there's your problem right there yeah I think that's going to be the minority of the time that people spend using this but I think I found the rationale at
least no no you guys man you guys are a terrible audience not not not you the people who are sitting in this room with me and like acting like they're Dead coming back to the software for a moment one of the things that was really weird about this is we found a turbo button in the software here and then we found a second Intel turbo boost toggle in the Cog menu here as far as we can tell the best way to run it is with this off which doesn't seem to do anything and turbo on in the 1X player slide in menu
it has a oh M gyro it's smooth got love that 120 HZ display freaking love that uh we can turn it on if the left trigger gets press oh that's pretty cool so this is useful obviously for navigating Windows like I'm doing right now but also for playing FPS games because I don't know about you guys but for me playing firstperson Shooters with a Controller joystick I I really struggle with it whereas when we did that video a couple of years back using the PlayStation 4 as a gyro aimer and then
just the buttons for movement and weapon switching and all that stuff made a huge difference for me out of the box it's configured to allocate 16 GB of the onboard memory to the G GPU in this particular configuration your mileage may vary with that I've been instructed to try the webcam I mean I guess if this is going to be your laptop then you're going to want a decent webcam that's cool it has the IR emitter so that you can use it with Windows hello for biometric authentication and I think I
see an array mic there so the recording quality on this thing might actually be decent do they really brand it as an AI camera have they said what makes it AI auto focus tracking autofocus tracking I mean I look as good in any place as I ever do it's only a one megapixel camera and no amount of AI is going to fix that too much and the audio is as good as what it is right now let's try out crab RVE speaking of audio I search for crabrave youtube.com Bing get good the first result is Bing videos with that
said this will just play the YouTube video and it won't have ads so it's kind of a hack did you know this yeah there there's no there's no ads that's piracy l no that's not piracy that's a workaround all right let's turn on the sound it's Wi-Fi 6E so that's good but  best very decent not bad actually pretty impressed not an amazing Sound Stage but pretty reasonable quality on the subject of things not amazing we've gotal fired up now which looks fine right now but we haven't tried to run the Benchmark yet
give me a second here h i see there's supposed to be shrapnel there but instead there just kind of isn't and as much as this isn't 1X player's fault this is down to Intel's optimization of their Arc drivers it's definitely something that 1X player has to deal with and something that will affect the users of this device what will also affect users of the device is the performance compared to amd-based devices like the Ally and the Lenovo Legion go the reason I bring up the legion go is not because I was
particularly enthused about it when I used it but because it is a large screen device that would be at least closer to equivalent to this one hopefully Intel can continue to improve that because the bones overall are pretty cool it doesn't get obnoxiously loud and the size of the screen makes it a truly unique experience compared to other handhelds the only other obstacle then is the price you can buy over one and a half Legion goes for the price of this thing and almost two allies both of which will
perform better Hey look it's my wife hey Von come try this you've been playing some da the diver on the Ally what do you think of the weight and ergonomics of this boy um it's really heavy actually is it not I do I hear that wrong no I I mean you can't be wrong about whether something is heavy to you I mean I said that you were basically She-Hulk and that it wouldn't bother you earlier when I was talking about it but like sure go ahead and contradict me just like with the kids I
feel the triggers um easier to hold this one's harder to press but this one's easier to press compared to the Ally yeah okay I like the bigger screen that's cool all right thanks H okay and thank you for watching subscribe to Short Circuit
