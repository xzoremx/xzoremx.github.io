I'm really excited for this product because it's called The Meta Quest 3s but despite the name it's actually more of a Quest 2 plus it's got the same Optical stack as the Quest 2 here but it's got the same chip upgraded chip upgraded software features some of them as The Meta 3 here and I have actually not tried the meta Quest 3 uh but I spent a lot of time with the Quest 2 so it's perfect for me because I can be a little bit ignorant of what I'm missing in the quest 3 I'm going to try that a
little bit just to compare but um that's why I'm excited and that's why you should be excited too in case you have somehow been living under a rock for a number of years now the meta quest line our VR headsets by the company meta uh they're basically the only huge big player in VR uh anymore other than Apple now so anytime they release a new headset it's kind of a big deal this is the question 3s and despite me saying that it's more of a two plus it actually has one upgrade over the quest 3 and
something that makes it a lot more attractive it's $ 299 which we haven't really had a quest headset for 299 since before meta upgraded upgraded the price big upgrade up to$ 3.99 from $299 for the Quest 2 that was disappointing and now we have a 299 option once more one bonus that you're going to get over the Quest 2 is that the quest 3s comes with the same controllers as the quest 3 it doesn't have that ring for sensing uh for tracking movement anymore making them a little bit more portable uh so
that's nice to see so one obvious way that the quest 3s is different than the quest 3 but more similar to The Quest 2 is in its thickness it uses Fel lenses and the exact same Optical stack as the Quest 2 whereas the quest 3 will have those pancake lenses and a higher resolution uh the pancake lenses allowing it to be a little bit thinner and feeling less like it's extending out from your face but we'll see how it feels when I try it out an obvious upgrade that the quest 3s actually has
over the three and the two is the addition of two infrared sensors on the front which apparently increases the ability to track hands and stuff in a lower lit environment I'm excited to try that out on the left side we have the USBC port for charging and data or whatever you're going to use it for power button and what you might think at first is a head Jack if you're looking far away but no that's just another tracking camera there's no headphone jack they took out the headphone jack
compared to the Quest 2 why on the right side another tracking camera and volume rocker and this is a new edition as well compared to both the two and the three it's a button for pass through instead of having to double tap while you're in VR mode to see the outside world now it's just a simple button you can hit with your thumb so we'll see how easier that is though for real the quest 3s does inherit from the quest 3 this easily adjust adjustable strap you can just kind of pull it closed and open it
again it's so easy you can get it open there to accommodate a ponytail out the back or the cord coming out of your head from The Matrix some people are in The Matrix and use VR at the same time I don't I won't judge now this insert is telling me that I can get prescription lens inserts for The Meta 3s but thankfully like the Quest 2 the quest 3s accommodates people with glasses thank you for thinking of me because they this glasses spacer in the box that is attached to the power adapter and the USBC
cord oh there we go do the other headsets have this circular adapter this is cute and that supports 18 W charging so the quest 3s like the Quest 2 has a three-step ipd adjustment it does not have the quest 3's uh dial that like kind of has a lot of gradual steps in between it's just got three steps just like the two and I forget which one I use cuz it's been a while I'll have to do a trial and error there so there's this paperwork here with some quick start guide and that's it for what's in
the box let's get this out of here I want to enter the metaverse Oh but before that thanks to charge for sponsoring today's video their carbon mag series of power banks are mag safe compatible and crafted with a genuine carbon fiber making them both lightweight and durable the 5K model supports 7.5 W wireless charging weighing in at around a/4 of a pound while only being about 9 mm thick and the 10K variant may be slightly chunkier but it has double the capacity and 15
wat ch2 wireless charging plus both have 20 W wired charging for those quick topups check them out at the links in the description below whoa the reason I reacted there is because oh holy crap okay and this is why it was good it was smart Jake to get me to do this video because coming from The Quest 2 the first thing you see when you turn it on is the color pass through and this looks way better than the Quest 2 it's crazy as I was saying now you can see now you can see the color pass
through uh on the Quest 2 it's not only grayscale but it's a lot lower resolution I can actually read text  here it's circuit it's amazing one of the other upgrades that the 3s has is the ability like the uh meta Quest 3 to map out your 3D space using the sensors I think that's what it's doing right now I'm not going to refine it I'm going to trust the AI adjust boundary if needed honestly Quest 3s honestly it's pretty good you did pretty good so one of the things I like to do
in VR is to experience kind of the top end of what's capable on the current Hardware that I'm using right now this thing has the Snapdragon xr2 Gen 2 the same processor as the quest 3 uh compared to the Quest 2 which just has the xr2 Gen 1 so this is upgraded and we're going to try the new Batman Arkham Shadows game which is only available on the quest three and and 3s so if you're upgrading from The Quest 2 to the 3s that's one of the things you're going to get is some experiences that are not
going to be available on the Quest 2 which will be eventually discontinued okay I want to be Batman let's do this more so than when the original Batman Arkham Asylum came out I feel this feels    okay this is so funny it is very much like the uh the the Arkham games for for not having used any VR headsets since the Quest 2 this doesn't really seem like a generational Improvement to me uh maybe with a higher resolution on the quest 3 it would look better but it is the same chip so I don't know we'll have
to see now as I've said where the quest 3s really shines in comparison to The Quest 2 is the color pass through and the augmented augmented reality experience so we're going to do a pass through game this is something that the Quest 2 just could not do I mean I've mapped my 3D space and there's like a window into the synth Rider's World in like the whole there's like a hole in reality I saw this demoed when they were talking about this feature at first and uh I thought it looked cool and in fact it does
playing a VR game while seeing people in the real world over there is kind of cool it's definitely makes the experience a lot more social than it was I think I like this game better than beat saber for one I probably look way cooler than lonus ever does doing it right tell me do I look cooler than lonus right now so since the quest 3s has upgraded hand tracking might as well jump into hand physics lab in terms of the hand tracking in this thing it's very impressive I'm impressed a lot more than
I was with the Quest 2 with like the intuitiveness with which I'm using a lot of stuff it's tracking my hands very well I haven't seen a lot of like dropouts or choppiness with the hands like I am uh you know I haven't tried the quest 3 yet I've tried the quest two but as a jump from The Quest 2 this is very impressive I feel like I'm here and I feel like I have little skeltal Wiggly bones for real okay this is my first time playing the quest 3 not the 3s that I just had on my face and I
can I can immediately notice I feel like I can immediately notice a higher resolution in the like UI elements and stuff the color the pass through actually looks very very similar in terms of the readability of text and stuff there's not much difference between this and the 3s so that's cool to see you're definitely getting that upgrade handed down okay so is this faster oh yeah so the scanning process is like noticeably a bit faster than the 3s on the 3 in-game assets the beat saer
text up there is noticeably sharper in addition with the pancake lenses we're using pancake lenses instead of frenel lenses which have these concentric rings on the lens and it kind of distorts light as it comes outward you have kind of a sweet spot in the middle and then things that get farther away from The Sweet Spot get kind of distorted there's like light flaring and stuff you know okay so like for beat saber I don't know how much of a difference something like this is going
to make so coming in from the three to the 3s uh you know like I said there is a slightly lower fov and resolution but in terms of the controller tracking in terms of what it feels like to play a game and look around still feels great uh so it's great to see that is giving us an affordable option so comparing the quest 3 to the 3s has kind of confirmed my you know my take that I gave in the beginning of the video which is that the comparison of the 3S to the three is the somewhat less important one than
comparing it to the Quest 2 it's a clear upgrade uh from The Quest 2 not in terms of resolution or in like the ipd adjustment a couple of those things but in other ways it's a clear adjustment better hand tracking the pass through button the processor running the whole thing the Snapdragon xr2 Gen 2 but that invites the question should you upgrade to the 3s if you have a Quest 2 for me as a somewhat longtime Quest 2 user I don't know if I would consider upgrading just to go to the 3s if I was going to
want to move on from my Quest 2 I think I'd want a kind of a bigger jump and I'd be considering the quest 3 at this point but if you're new new to the VR game and you do want some of those more advanced features you're not going to just be using a headset just for like exercise and you know the kind of like you can get away with having lower resolution if you want some of those higher Fidelity experiences but you're not ready to go to the top end getting a 128 gig 3s for
$299 a pretty good deal but I'll make you a good deal if you're looking for something else to watch go check out this video where I talked to an AI powered stuff stuffed animal meant for children it yeah exactly
