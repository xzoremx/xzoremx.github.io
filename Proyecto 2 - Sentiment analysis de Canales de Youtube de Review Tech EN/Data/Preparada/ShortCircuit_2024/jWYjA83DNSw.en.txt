today we've got something interesting espresso sponsored this video so we could take a look at the new espresso 17 Pro and this thing supposedly does it all it's portable it's a touchcreen and most importantly to me it's 4K at just 17.3 in meaning you're going to get a whopping 259 PPI absolutely wild pixel density inspired by creatives fine-tuned for professionals designed for people like you like me ah oh it's huge wow you know you hear 17.3 in and you don't think it's that big until you're like holding
it in your hand this is definitely like a giant tablet they've also included this little handy dandy cloth which is great cuz it's already got a bunch of fingerprints on it what else do we get in the Box though that's what I want to know let's get this to the side this is a you know it's a nice like double layer cardboard too corrugated so this is going to be pretty well packed even though it's just a small box uh I also love the purple I'm just a sucker for like purple blue
orange uh comes with a handy dandy little purple cable as well USB C to C not super long this is probably like a 3ft cable anything a little like 5T even would be nice just so you've got that little bit of extra length there for plugging it in what else do we got what's in the box see more create more be more anywhere cuz it's portable drawn on espresso so they did did this artwork on the espresso which is really cool I love it when people actually use their own products um that looks like it's
basically everything you get in the Box just a cable and a cleaning cloth but they've included a bunch of other stuff for us because not only can you buy this by itself but you can buy it in a bundle or you can buy these products separately they've got their espresso pen Unleash Your creativity and the power of your espresso display unleash it I say I'm going to unleash this pen right now I tell you what there we go oh that made  satisfying that's great I don't use a lot of pens or stylus so I not you know
going to be the best in terms of uh telling you how good this pen is but we're going to have a special guest later come down and help me out who does use this stuff all the time it's got a button it's got not another button and a little USBC charger right at the end there key features sketch draw and left rightclick transition through a range of creative applications like sketch and Adobe CC apps navigate pan and create through whiteboard collaboration tools like Meo figma and concept board they've
also got this espresso display stand and like it's a tiny box but this thing is actually really heavy it's got to be at least a pound or two I love how small this packs up because like it's a really small display so you don't want whatever stand you're going to be bringing if you're going to move any of this stuff anywhere uh you don't want the stand to be huge and chunky so this is actually really refreshing if someone who's had to move around a lot of monitors on big giant
stands this is wild I wish everything could just pack down into this tiny little package here it's very strong oh I love the purple accents again that's great it's got a neat little trick for kickstand mode so that instead of you know oh well here let's try to put this on is it just magnetic o that's real nice that actually worked really well and you know what it's holding it you've definitely got to make some adjustments beforehand it's okay like at the certain angle then
like this is just going to tip over from a slight push I would love to see a bit more support to make it so that it doesn't just tip over if I want to put it at kind of a weird angle and then if you do want to use it more for drawing at like a reasonable angle you just kind of pop it down here put it on the kickstand that goes into place there and then pop it on now you're get to go where' the pen go oh I wanted to do the that's such a good sound look at that I'm drawing already
I'm so good at drawing uh I'm not but you know I oh that's a it's a good satisfying click I like the pen they've also got so that you can keep your screen nice and safe a big screen protector guide stickers lift stickers they've got it all so you're not going to screw this up it doesn't feel like paper oh I guess it's still got a film on it all right sure like uh we're not going to throw the screen protector on but one thing to note is that it supposedly feels like paper Okay I I can't say it feels like
paper without at least peeling a little bit off and trying to they sent us two so I can open one okay I don't know if I go so far as to say it feels like paper but like it's definitely a different kind of it's not like a slippery plastic like the out like the outer film is we've also got their new K1 17 it's more of a screen cover than a case but you know it'll definitely keep things a little extra protected when you slide this thing into your bag actually fits in the laptop sleeve like a
glove LTT store.com that's actually really good 17 in doesn't seem like a lot until you remember that like a lot of work laptops are more like 14 in 13 in 15 in 16 in maybe even 17 in it is pretty thin like you saw it in the backpack no problem but how heavy is it actually it's only 2.4 lb that's not too bad and then what about this stand this is it's actually probably pretty close 3 lb no it's only two wow it's lighter probably just cuz it's so like dense and compact it feels heavier in your hand
cuz it's not like spread out so much but uh that's only like 4 lbs of travel weight a little over that's not bad as for the iio and what you can connect to it we've got two USBC ports right here which is great always love to see plenty of USBC and that's absolutely it we've just got what looked to be a couple of little vents up here for I'm guessing thermals otherwise I actually like how Sleek it is there's very little branding it just says espresso in the bottom uh right corner right here and otherwise
just black very Sleek let's see how good the screen is though let's turn this thing on it just turned on Apple device detected it no problem look at that wow you know this thing seems pretty cool but one thing that's driving me nuts is I absolutely hate trackpads and MacBooks don't have a touchscreen this thing is a touchscreen so let me actually use it oh my god it works D I mean it looks pretty good it's not HDR but it's got 98% of DCI P3 cover they also rated at 450 nits and we
measured 475 roughly so you get a little bit more bank for your buck it's got four picture modes work create game and night and we found work to be the best the most color accurate it's okay not crazy outstanding but good enough for most creators at least in my opinion if you want some more in-depth results then we'll have them on screen here there's color accuracy and color gamut testing that we did it's not bad the only kind of drawback for going portable like this this and not being OLED is that you're
not going to get any dimming zones and so this is just about a th000 to1 contrast ratio which is very typical of ips it still looks pretty good though as much as I love HDR SDR can still look decent one thing to note is that it doesn't come with its own color management software out of the box we had to create our own ICC profile but once we did it actually drastically improved our color accuracy and we're going to have that ICC profile linked below so if you do buy it you know put
it on yourself see if it helps things one thing to note is that this actually does have speakers on it which is always a plus at least in my opinion they're not the loudest and there's really no base you can hear it for  yourself but it's not awful and I think that speakers are better than no speakers personally check this out you can just magnet snap the pen to the top which is always really nice uh they've got two key pieces of software flow and jot flow was actually really cool it's got a
bunch of Windows snapping stuff so like we can just move that around to wherever we want that's great and then uh jot is this software here it's their drawing stuff that you can use to Just note down those are squiggles you know I'm a big artist it's actually pretty easy to use like I'm at a really bad angle right now you know don't take this as a good example of how easy it is to use this thing it's actually pretty easy just you know put it in front of you like an actual display that you're going to use
the other cool thing is that uh flow the magnetic snapping stuff is actually just an app that you can download so if you get any other say you don't want this monitor for whatever reason um but you have something else you can get their software and install it so you can keep that snapping uh feature that you so sorely desired another pretty cool feature about the pen and jot is that you can use the back of it to take these little screenshots here screenshot Bell look put it right into jot and then
we'll just uh put a big like X on his forehead I mean that's a terrible example but like Circle his head I'm not an artist at all um so that's what he's getting he's getting stickman on top of himself but when it comes to using software like this I'm really not an apple daily driver and I'm not a graphic designer and I don't use pens or anything like that so let's get someone who actually does know this stuff a bit better to come and take a look at it so I brought Mar our graphic designer who
does all of our great thumbnails and the pictures for our merch photos y like this one of Riley and she actually uses Apple products and pens and drawing tablets and stuff so please make Riley even more beautiful okay than he already is let's try Photoshop what's the size difference between This and like an iPad or whatever you're normally drawing on oh this is way bigger than an than an iPad yeah would you prefer that bigger screen yes okay it's probably not going to be perfect but it'll be close enough
okay that's close enough yeah just disappears wow okay let's try it again okay the paper kind of feeling feels better feels better because it's not very slippery now yeah so that's good as well if I apply more pressure it's like the line sticker the line sticker so that's good it's like you're actually using a marker or a paintbrush mhm but it's not again when I try to draw something with like Precision is not what 100% precise so uh that's the thing that I'm like I wish it was a
little better I mean the iPad it's just like a big phone let's say yeah so it's not and here we have just an extension of this computer yeah if I have this too it will be better if I just have like the iPad which is just another product which I don't even need because I already have a computer again like right so with this instead you could just get a whole new monitor that's portable exactly huge cuz it's like almost it's 17 in and then it does have touch which Apple doesn't natively have on IMAX or
Mac Pro MacBook Pro and then for anyone who's not necessarily trying to draw final artwork for something that's a bit more demanding you know I could use this thing to take notes no problem he looks like he's having even more fun though in his like weird plant almost underwater kind of Vibes those looks like seaweeds and then yeah the blues I don't I'm kind of I I want to try sorry I keep pinching yeah pinching like if I had an iPad yeah maybe it's just a matter of like getting used to it
yeah it comes with a stand bundled for $8.99 normally but right now it's on sale for only $7.99 800 bucks plus if you want an even bigger discount we're going to have a link down below and you can use code circuit 10 to get 10% off your purchase so there you have it the espresso 17 Pro portable display with jot and flow whether you're a creative who wants an extra high PPI touchscreen for drawing and taking notes someone looking to add a second monitor to their laptop for dual displays during virtual
meetings or you just need a quality portable screen and stand that doesn't cost an arm and a leg it's definitely worth checking out and I almost forgot about how easy it is to put it into portrait mode got to love auto rotation think that I think that it's taken some practice but these lines do look better already uh compared to what it started with yeah for example when I did like this like lines over here because they were a little bit more straight kind of thing it helps me like having that
straight line there so it looks smooth right different from for example the leaves here right um right so more natural things might be a little harder but if you're trying to do like hard Edge patterns and stuff like that it actually works pretty well exactly yeah cool yeah I guess Riley looks better now he does he should get these patterns on that shirt that look great the dad hat should come with this yellow squiggle I'm very uh in favor of that and um you know if you want to watch other videos
there's a bunch of them I don't know what video should I th  yeah that's good okay we're done then sure
