truth be told I've never been a huge fan of the iPad if I wanted something convenient and portable I would simply use the phone that's already in my pocket and if I wanted to really get something done and I wanted to carry something this big around I would just use my laptop but there's no denying that these devices have been incredibly popular over the years and now we've got the best one ever this my friends is the new iPad Pro I'm going to figure out how to get out of the box at some point
featuring Apple's new M4 processor and from everything that I've heard about it so far it wow it really is thin isn't it that is kind of wild of course the thinness is not what caught my eye first it's that display guys we have run this thing through the gamut of tests in the lab and I don't know how to put this other than to say it is on par if not better than any display that we have ever touched before that includes the "$20,000 reference display that we" checked out recently from Flanders
scientific kind of makes the pricing seem downright reasonable doesn't it we'll get to that but first let's talk about what Apple has achieved here starting with brightness looks unreal my God the sweat glisten Holy balls I don't think I I've ever seen anything as lifelike as this through a screen we have seen dual panel displays before in fact High senses uled branding was originally used to describe a dual LCD panel that stacked the two panels together in order to achieve much
deeper blacks well Apple has kind of turned that concept on its head with dual oleds oleds already have great blacks so what are they using dual panels for to massively boost the peak brightness what's really impressive here is that Apple has managed to deliver an "OLED that does 1,000 knits of brightness" across the entire screen and not only after half an hour does it not get dimmer it actually managed to get brighter as the pixels warmed up so you are now getting across an entire white
display a th000 flipping knits meanwhile though it offers a reference mode that "allows you to lock it in at 1,000 nits" with unparalleled accuracy I mean Brandon have we seen a display that is more accurate out of the box than this thing in reference mode only the fs for what 10 to 20 times the price though I just don't know how to I don't know how to  think I don't think graphs can convey the difference in the consumption of HDR content with this device versus something lesser it offers 10 to 120 HZ
very able refresh rate it's available with their Nano texture which we're not sure if it's the same as the pro display xdr cuz we've got the not nano texture one but in a nutshell if what you were looking for was an iPad with one of the best displays on the planet then this is it if what you were looking for however was just an iPad to hunt and pecket emails with and to casually have off to the side while you're cooking I don't know if the value proposition is going to be as strong here for funsies I
grabbed some old iPad we had kicking around do you guys actually know exactly which one this is iPad Pro 11 in the that even mean Apple can someone look up MTX Q2 vc/ a for me 2018 iPad Pro 11 in perfect you couldn't have just put that you know what it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh I mean I don't know all right that's a little faster don't know if it's uh world changing  so I guess what I'm trying to say is I understand both of the major takes on this product on the one hand very very
cool beautiful display unbelievable on the other hand if all you need is an  iPad is it really that much thinner I mean yeah but some of this thickness is our skin from dbrand who happens to be our sponsor at least I hope it's from dbrand apparently all I need to do is read this I mean that seems simple enough got this though enjoy your helium is this a fanfiction I'm going to try and do this  one little lonus the pint-sized panderer might rise with wide eyes to tackle tricky tag tips swiftly stretching
Skyward from his undisguised child-sized bedside beside a surprise suspicious sponsor dbrand hands and commands his squeaky freaky speech get squeakier and freakier to cheekier commend their profoundly precise products pre preface with a Prelude to their prodigious pranks deserve no thanks what even is this s lin.com to buy some iPad skins wow that makes my voice sound downright low pitched coming back to the iPad Pro though just because we didn't see a huge Earth shattering difference
in day-to-day responsiveness though doesn't mean that there isn't a big difference in performance the M4 chip at the heart of this thing came much earlier than we were expecting and is absolutely loaded for bear not only did it manage GPU performance that's about on par with a 5500 XT which admittedly is a relatively low-end desktop graphics card but is a desktop graphics card but its CPU performance was a boat on par with a 13th gen core i7 oh yeah and did I mention that it managed 17 hours of
battery life in our endurance test imagine how much battery life you could get out of this thing if Apple made it just a couple millimeters thicker and one of their priorities is making sure that the iPad never cannibalizes MacBook sales no matter how close they make this thing to a Macbook let's have a look at some of the accessories oh starting with the ones that came with it you get oh wow look at that a charging brick Oh and a usb2 cable wow thanks Apple USB 2 cable I mean honestly
at this point I'm Stockholm syndrom enough that I'm just thankful that the USBC Port which thankfully it has is Thunderbolt for compliance so you can hook up all kinds of accessories and docks you can hook it up to highspeed storage and transfer your data off of it that is pretty cool oh yeah while we're here it's got four speakers two on each side we've got our lock button over here man how many microphones this thing got I spotted one over there four dang that's pretty cool oh while we're
here there's actually a downgrade we lost the ultra wide camera but thankfully we keep the liar scanner so we can you know gather depth maps of our environments let's have a look at the accessories meet the magic keyboard again it's mager than ever I suppose and that is what these little Pogo pads are for seriously that's it that's how they make sure that it's not too much like a MacBook that hinge could not possibly have opened any more than that cuz then it would have been a Macbook the fact that
you can buy an iPad with an M4 processor you cannot buy a MacBook with an M4 processor and they still don't give you the option to choose between iPad OS and Mac OS on this thing absolutely you know what I don't care because it doesn't matter to me I'm not going to be daily driving either of them but it should matter to you the Apple faithful there is no argument left for Apple for why they shouldn't just allow you to use whichever software you like ooh pencil Pro now this has been a major source of
controversy I've seen a lot of the usual arguments against Apple's intergenerational incompatibility but in this case I actually don't really agree with them the compatibility list for the new pencil Pro is extremely short it's the new iPads and that's it and I can understand why people are upset about this I mean clearly they are have bought into this ecosystem and they want to be able to continue to use their old iPad with the new pencil and if Apple chose to make this not compatible with the old ones
that was a design choice that Apple made but they've added an awful lot of functionality to this thing that honestly kind of justifies that it's a new generation of product designed to work with new generations of products in my mind unfortunately all of our artists they're off today or work from home which is really awkward are you going to have one of them come in and actually like draw okay cool hi I'm Maria I'm a graphy designer here at lmg and I love the iPad Pro I've been
using the iPad since 2016 I'm a huge fan of it and actually I bought this new iPad Pro M4 because I had an M1 and I think it was really worth the upgrade now especially as well because of the new pencil Pro I use procreate like 100% of the time oh I like like illustrating and I love of like how smooth it is like how easy it is to draw whatever I want honestly okay yeah the hovering here with the new pencil Pro I think it's super cool it would be cool if you hover over for example this menu here of the
brushes and you can squeeze and you select the one that it's selected in a way but I mean maybe they will upgrade do an upgrade on that hopefully I love this new feature with the top double top I can change immediately to eraser so if I need to erase something here it's super super easy and then get go double tap and continue my drawing for now in procreate we don't have like the squeeze feature with the menu coming out with the brushes but I guess this is something will come out eventually uh
for now there's other apps that support that feature of the pencil but I mean I work on this every single day I love drawing like when I'm home even if I'm like watching TV or something sometimes I'll draw while I watch a show or something it's so perfect how the pencil takes exactly the pressure that I'm applying to it so I think I finished my artwork now I mean overall I love it Apple you did a great job with this device and the display is awesome like the colors look super vibrant it's like
if I just Drew this in real life but it's now digital and it's way easier and faster I love it this is so stupid the fact that I can't just like Fold It Down 180Â° like why do I have why do I have to  I you broke it let's go back to the keyboard for a second here that's something that I actually am qualified to evaluate now my ADD brain has a really hard time with these kinds of  it that's a darn good keyboard I've been kind of into the low profile Keys lately um and the TRU pad is apparently bigger
than last gen once you put the giant thing on it though like is it really that thin hold on let's go back to my let's go back to my RTX 47d gaming laptop now ah I don't know man I uh but hey it's a what is it like half a millimeter thinner not everyone is going to put this case on it a lot of people are just going to use it as an iPad and if that's the case then uh it's them and apparently it's not even fragile Zach from Jerry rever said that it held up surprisingly well to his bend test this
way although went a little bit easier than he expected this way I guess they weren't ready for that oh what I'm ready for is to check out the speakers apparently they're flipping awesome the device is almost too thin to contain this amount of audio greatness have you noticed how much it vibrates it's like in your in your  hands I mean the only reason I'm not blown away is because I was expecting them to be this good they're they're great oh what about the camera though I bet it sucks but honestly if you're
taking pictures with an pad you deserve for your pictures to suck okay that's pretty bad though that is dog no that's that's really bad like like iPhone 6 bad but you know what I bet the front facing camera is decent and is in a decent position now back to my whole seriously Apple this isn't a Macbook at this point they have moved the front-facing camera to the side edge now oh no the front- facing camera is terrible too it really did cost you something when you gave up that um that
thickness what else is there for us to talk about comes in space black and silver also known as black and silver uh you can oh you can locate the pencil Pro with the find my app actually find my app freaking saved my wife's purse like two weeks ago find my app ah yes the elephant in the room the price good Lord this thing starts at ",000 and that's for like standard glass" that's for no cellular that's for 256 gigs of store do you know how much 256 gigs of nand costs like nothing
these days and you get to pay another $200 for another 256 gigs of storage no wonder their customers are so flipping pissed off at this point wow  $2300 and you know what's even more remarkable it is somehow not the most egregiously priced item in Apple's lineup it's not even second Apple set the bar extremely low Great Value good job Apple compared at least to some of your other stuff and truthfully you know if I wanted this kind of display I kind of do this is the only way to get it
