oh excuse me sorry was trying to test a theory and I guess I was right it seems like every time I sneeze somebody releases a new one of these handheld PCS it's at the point now where pretty much no matter what form factor or spec you're interested in there is something for you meet the iono flip DS a uh Brazen attempt at creating a machine that looks like it will be absolutely perfect for Nintendo DS emulation but in truth it's a little bit more complicated  machine it's
thick the top looks really slick though oh this is something it's available in two colors black and wouldn't recommend uh this has only been used for a couple of hours by our Labs team for testing and you can already see it's starting to look pretty dirty those are replaceable these are replaceable hey there we go huh well  package wow damn boy 65 Watts detachable USBC cable love to see it oh different textured grip pieces they're worse USBC cable looks like a 6ft cable and I was
wrong it's a 5ft cable what a bizarre C cable length Okay International adapters and USBC to a adapters for one and two oh I guess now's a good time to look at the io of this thing on the top you've got your right triggers these are hall effect triggers you've got your shoulder buttons you've got a third button really love to see that programmable you've got a Micro SD slot just a little something like that then we've got two USBC ports one is USB 3 one is USB 4 so there's the possibility that you could run
Thunderbolt compatible with peripherals like external GPU Docks but it's not a guarantee on AMD platforms and it can be a little bit flaky and of course you probably wouldn't want to anyway because that's right my friends we've got an oculink connector now unlike Thunderbolt or USB 4 it's not hot pluggable so you can't just plug in your GPU whenever you feel like but if you shut down your system plug in an oculink egpu then boot up your system you don't have to deal with some of the additional protocol
overhead of these interfaces and you get a full pcie gen 4x4 connection meaning even reasonably performant modern gpus should run really freaking well in this thing what else we got here we've got stereo speakers on the bottom like to see the bottom mounted headphone jack appreciate that although I wouldn't mind it if one of these USBC ports was on the bottom at the back wow that's a lot of ventilation intake exhaust and that makes sense because inside we've got the same well I shouldn't say the same I was
going to say the same processor that's been taking the handheld Market by storm the Z1 extreme I mean 7840 u i mean 8840 U that's right my friends it's not the same because it has more neural processing it's actually kind of funny if you load up the pages for the 7840 U and the 8840 u in two tabs and then flip between them one of them's Global and one of them's Global and China and Japan in between those processor releases China and Japan joined the globe yeah these are very similar processors and
I'm making such a big deal about it because technically this unit is "available with either the 7,000 series" "or 8,000 series both of which have the" same eight zen4 cores the clock up to 5.1 GHz just like the Z1 extreme and they've got the same Radeon 78m graphics like the Z1 extreme the only difference is whether you get the last gen neural processor or the 8000 series slightly before neural processor what you'll be doing on it on a device like this I have no idea but that's something for you to
figure out not me wow this is a big screen I don't know what it is maybe it's just like the muscle memory of it but the last time I used a dual screen device it was a Nintendo DS so I was just a little surprised to see such a actually large and vibrant screen iono seems to have absolutely no idea what the specs of this thing are they advertise everything from 400 nits I think it is to 550 nits but when we measured it in our lab we got over 800 nits which is extremely bright for an
SDR display making this thing easily usable even Outdoors which is pretty cool grayscale performance was okay at 2.4 was a little on the warm side good for HD video but it'll be a little darker than normal for reference or desktop content and it managed 97% coverage of the srgb color space which is fine color accuracy was also fine and the same can pretty much be said of the bottom display except that it had a little bit better gamut coverage and doesn't get as bright let's talk about
the inputs H it's quite flat though I'm sure any resemblance to the Nintendo DS is quite coincidental but unlike the DS instead of going with you know those awful slidy joysticks in order to keep it flat they've got a pretty decent range of motion on these and they've just recessed them under the surface I guess that's a big part of the reason this thing is so bloody thick because look how much of the space is being taken up by these joysticks they feel okay though I think it's a pretty okay
tradeoff actually ergonomics are generally pretty okay especially considering this thing's considerable heft what else have we got going on here we've got a button for Io space okay so we can adjust our power profile we can adjust our performance overlay sure let's turn that on let's go simple though we can adjust our fan configuration smart or Auto Smart or Auto should I do a smart or an automatic segue to our sponsor xplit whether you're a streamer a content creator or

sensible config yeah it's definitely too bright do you want me to turn it down Glen okay let's lose some of this 800 nits of brightness here oh there's one of those little CH oh that is uh not the best one of these little trackpads I've ever used all right we got our oh cool some programmable buttons select the window to move to the secondary screen okay sure we did come across some bugginess managing applications between the two screens including a weird one where when we were doing our battery
testing we found that extinguishing the bottom screen didn't really have a significant impact on battery life uh because it was still showing up to Windows and it was still outputting to it it was just a full black screen at whatever brightness it was at as far as we could tell but the good news is that it's windows so when it comes to window management across multiple screens there are lots of different options both built into the operating system and from third parties so you got your standard Xbox C
buttons right here you've got whatever this button oh okay ah go to desktop button let's see what this button does it is okay but if we do that oh I see so that overlay is an overlay it sits in the foreground okay so this toggles that functionality that's pretty cool oh one thing I haven't mentioned power buttons here built-in fingerprint scanner love to see it I am not a fan of these vibration Motors can I just get that out there right now you can hear what I don't like 
bet uh let's see if we can adjust that a little bit okay vibration high oh that'll probably oh guys really the controller   low well not great vibration Motors I mean hey how about this performance though all right are we actually getting over 100 FPS in PS of horizon 5 right now overall gaming performance on this device was very solid not as good as the Rog Ally curiously it seems like iano is prioritizing CPU clock speed compared to GPU clock speed but pretty much in line
with what you'd expect from a Z1 extreme  speakers not very direct sometimes you can tell and sometimes you can really   very tiny though of course if what you're after is the perfect machine to play Nintendo DS games I bet you're willing to overlook kind of mediocre speakers cuz like realistically how good were the speakers on the DS now I should clarify all of my hours in Mario Kart DS were on a DS and that's kind of for good reason DS emulation is good in terms of performance but in terms of um
configuring for the dual screen layout of the DS It's not that great um it turns out this is kind of how you're intended to do it with most of the emulators there are hacky ways to get it to work a little bit better than this but um I saw a comment on a forum from a prominent member I don't think they were a developer but they were certainly a prominent member saying yeah if we had that option you'd try it for a little bit and then you'd be like ah forget it it's better to just have the screens
right next to each other I think I might kind of agree well here let's let's give this a shot yeah what's the benefit of having all this white space other than nostalgia laying it out like this I'm not sure there's some other challenges with playing DS games on a machine like this I guess one of the big ones is like why would you do that the battery life is going to be a fraction of what you'd get from an actual DS which is running a glorified Smartwatch processor by today's standards we got anywhere from
under an hour in our extreme stress test to about 5 hours in our endurance test which is very respectable for something running a 45 hour battery with this kind of processor horsepower but nothing compared to what you'd get on a DS the other big issue is that if you really want to Pirate DS games um the DS is thoroughly thoroughly hacked at this point not going to lie guys if I really wanted to emulate the DS I think I'd almost rather have a Game Boy like form factor with a really tall
screen then I just don't have the unnecessary gap between my screens that doesn't really yeah seem to contribute anything we got a little hyper fixated on the Nintendo DS we forgot about 3DS gameplay but if you're wondering it also plays fantastic and look you can use both the screens handy for uh throwing nuts at your foes bam we're playing at 3x resolution and everything is buttery smooth the other big elephant in the room is pricing it starts at just under "$1,000 and makes its way up into the"
"$1,500 range by the time you put the" latest processor the available 64 gigs of RAM and up to 2 TB of storage in it so cool yes the option that has a keyboard down here also pretty cool that's a really neat form factor with the ability to you know type passwords and stuff like that whenever it's inconvenient to use an on-screen keyboard speaking of which I thought I pressed something earlier oh yeah there you go this is rebound on screen keyboard by default okay so that's nice
really cool form factor very holdable actually kind of like the ergonomics I wish this was a little bit more rounded right here like it's a cool machine it's a cool factor it's a very complete package it's got Wi-Fi 6E it's got a 120 HZ display that yeah is pretty good it's just it's got a very challenging pricing structure right now when you can get an Rog Ali Z1 extreme for like $700 which is over $250 less and that's at full price with those things going on promo either open box or brand new
fairly frequently so if you're super into the form factor there's a lot to love here I mean the Ali doesn't have oculink that's pretty sick but if you're not that into the form factor well I wouldn't blame you it's really pocketable oh sort of as long as your pockets are thick subscribe to the short circuit
