there has never been a better time to be a gamer and a big part of that is all these amazing retro devices that are coming out that make playing old games better than ever and today we have the analog Duo this is the first PC engine turbo graphic 16 Focus fpga console which is pretty cool you might not have ever played the turbo Graphics 16 if you're in the west but the PC engine the Japanese counterpart was actually a better seller than the Mega Drive which is the Genesis
in Japan and it has probably one of the most underappreciated libraries of any console ever it has the best classic vany in my opinion it's got the Bon and arzon games it has the start of the ease franchise and finally it's easy to play it getting a turbo graphic 16 is pretty expensive you can get PC engines for cheap but they look like a smoker ate them and spat them out just like this this uh white console is kind of pre- smoker colored and I think I kind of dig it the console itself is very
reminiscent of a turbo Duo which is the combo device that they released uh that was both the PC engine and the CD add-on built in because the CD add-on actually came later and with it brought some of the console's absolute best games so this is a pretty small package it's a lot wider than other analog consoles uh but it's not deeper which is nice so that'll fit very well and because there's no cartridge going on top you could fit this in quite a small little space on your retro shelf on the front
we have our power our Hue card slot and our CD slot with the eject button on the back we have our SD card slot ours came pre-loaded with an SD card that has some cover art on it but yours will not we have an HDMI slot that can do up to 1080 p60 you have your two USBS where you can use any wired controller which is really nice and this one's actually type c which is sort of new for the full-fledged analog consoles the N Noir the super NT and the me SG are all micro USB which is not a huge deal cuz I'm not
unplugging replugging all the time but it's nice that they've uh entered the 21st century on the bottom we have this cool little analog pattern I think it's quite attractive and it'll help prevent it from slipping and sliding it's quite grippy uh and the neat little wavy pattern just like the turbo Duo had back in the day on the top we have this transparent bit that looks like you should be able to see the CD spinning but there's actually another smoker beige piece of plastic underneath so you
cannot on the side we have the PC engine controller Port it's cool that you can use an original controller but if you want to use a turbo Graphics controller you actually need a little adapter they're cheap but it would have been nice for them to include it in the Box the compromise is that they've built 2.4g as well as Bluetooth right into the console so you can use the 8bit D Wireless ones without a dongle we also have our headphone jack just like the original console had as well as our
volume rocker and the pairing Button as well as what I believe are controller Port indicators all right let's see what else is in the box we have a little analog sticker fpga and a quick start guide we have the full manual PDF as well as the most recent firmware uh which is nice but even better is the jailbroken firmware that's just been released which we will try also included is a is that what 3 ft C to C cable which works with the included block uh analog really recommends that you use
this block there's been some reports of voltage issues with other ones it's a bit of a shame I like to have four six Port USB things so I can power a bunch of devices at once so having to use an entire block just for this to be safe is a bit of an issue and honestly I probably would risk it we're going to be using the white analog today but it also comes in Black so it's just a preference thing one thing of note is that analog has finally caught up to their demand for many years it took years to get
stuff that you ordered what isn't awesome is that there's actually no controllers included with the device I understand you're trying to keep cost down but it's kind of frustrating if you don't know that and you get this beautiful device and you can't play it and most stores aren't carrying these so you have to wait another week or so to get your controller just something of notes make sure you get a controller when you buy this but before we can get to that let me tell you about our

1080P and so there'll be some scaling happening in the monitor that's fine for today it gives us an idea of what we're working with okay we load right into a little tutorial pairing is surprisingly easy Once you read the manual you hit the pairing button on the console then the 8bit D button on the controller and then hold select for it to flash quickly and then it paired in just a second and way we go that's that's not bad truly not a big deal I wish the pairing button
on the console was not so flush with it I'm not sure if I'm touching an LED or the button uh for the best experience Duo requires a dedic dedicated SD card uh it's good that I got one in there from you memories L save States capture screenshot Library reference level database to catalog your game collection games you play this is kind of neat in your library every time you play a game it'll add it and it'll show the time played and theoretically could have the art so you'll have a nice little
database of all the games you've played it's not ripping the game seemingly to the device like a poly Mega wood the whole point of this over a mister is that you want to put your real games in if you're buying this to rip games to this and you play other consoles just get a mister display modes original display modes Rec the appearance of the original hard display such as the PC engine LT and PC engine GT I'm not super familiar with the specific display modes that they're talking about that are
console based um but I do play a lot on a CRT and that's one thing I really like about analog consoles on Modern displays is that they do a good job appr approximating what a CRT would do to the very primitive Sprites here we are at Main men we got insert game we don't have a game in right now that's fine we have our library which shows all the games that have been played on this console if you're not familiar with the PC engine /t turbo Graphics it's kind of hybrid 8bit 16bit so it's more primitive
than the Mega Drive and the Super Nintendo but it's much more advanced than the NES or the Master System and you can see right away with the amount of colors as well as the Sprite detail we're going to go to settings Duo system and then we can mess around with my favorite part of the settings so we have our display mode so based on the different consoles they all have slightly different color profiles so we have our display modes we have our mode settings where you can adjust sharpness
inside the size menu we can set a custom scale with our resolution here or make sure that we're at integer scales of 3 4 5 if you're on a 1080p display I don't think there's a reason to not do 5x we have an option to show or unshow over scan we can choose between RGB and composite color in terms of audio we have the Huard audio as well as our volume selector it's nice this can actually play every PC engine game ever including the super Graphics games there was like 16 of them that were made and
so it's very nice that it's just included here we have Cedar options we can choose the cedar format if we're trying to like lock it into one specific one we'll leave that on autod detect we have our controller options uh again autod detect I'm going to trust that it works that's one of the strengths of the analog systems when I play on my Mis at home I often have to Tinker with things and mess around with things if I want just to plug something in and it works exactly as intended I generally choose
an analog console for that this is apparently os7 but if you have an analog pocket it's going to look very familiar although it doesn't have open fpga and so I'm a little bit disappointed that you don't get access to the multitude of cores that are designed for open fpga use and I think that's especially disappointing considering that the card adapters for the analog pocket have come out and you can actually put Cube Cards into an analog pocket using the adapters now and there's a lot more options
available through the pocket if you're you're playing handheld and they're even updating it to be more versatile through the dock at the end of the day the thing that matters is does it look good and does it play well and because this is an fpga system it's probably going to be fraking awesome there's imperceptible lag they claim it's not emulation but fpga is still emulation it's just way better Hardware design specifically for this one task and so I could play this game but I want to play a game that I I
actually know much better and that is Castle Rondo of Blood the fact that I want to just play this game and stop talking tells me that this is a very accurate experience even wirelessly I don't feel any lag it's immediate response it looks good I wish I had other filters I could play with to get a preferred look but in terms of play experience this feels awesome as much as I want to sit here and play through this entire game right now I'm going to call in Tanner who has a whole
new perspective on retro games for me all right what game do you want to play what what do we have we have I think our best games are legally backed up in this beautiful Shrek Double Dragon we have garu d tetsu special which I don't know and Bong 3 which is another great single player game huh really oh multiplayer game one of the issues I'm seeing now that we're connecting two controllers is that there's no indicator on the controllers which Port they're plugged into there's the indicator on the side
of here that tells you how many are plugged in that's not necessarily the fault of analog but that's a little bit of an oversight for this controller maybe they'll make a V2 that has like more LEDs to indicate what we're doing power golf Bonk 3 what we doing B 3 Bonk 3 two player two player it's probably like Mario where it takes turns oh it's like Sonic where we can play at the same time so yeah you can't when you jump on step you have to use your forehead to to see oh no I was so excited to be giant for a
second honestly this picture looks good the sound we're using a monitor so I don't have very high expectations for the sound I assume the sound is probably pretty good yeah that's one of the things I like about analog consoles is that the sound works pretty well from my Mis there's some consoles that just in certain situations sound off and I never really feel that with my analog consoles I always am pretty darn certain that I'm getting the right experience people that are a little more familiar with this
Library games have noted that there are some audio inconsistencies uh compared to original Hardware but it seems like it's nothing so serious that if this is your first time playing TCN games you would notice let's change the game we're  that's not bad apparently some people have been complaining about how far it spits this out and it seems like a reasonable spot where I can just kind of pull it out there are reports of discs becoming scratched in the console these are old discs so these are not a good
indicator hold on before you do that before you do that let's take a look at what the bottom looks like oh you're smart oh there's some chunks yeah the these are not well cared for discs to begin with so Mak a bunch of differentes all right double drag double drag Dragon let's go punch the mother flers I think that the PC engine is such an interesting piece of Hardware hold on what's happening with the Sprites here are you seeing what's happening yeah that flickering I'm not sure if that's
accurate to the original experience or not but it's definitely noticeable I find it interesting how neatly between 8th and 16 bit the PC engine sits like it looks better than NES games but not quite as good as Genesis games I was just playing Streets of Rage 2 on the Genesis and it looks so much better than this but this is so much better than Double Dragon on the NES oh I forgot about price it's $250 seems like a lot but for the polished experience that you're getting
I think it's pretty fair you'll know if that's worth it to you overall if you're the audience for this you probably already know it if you want a very easy out of the box experience that's very accurate very simple to use the analog consoles are great if you're someone that's trying to maximize your dollar and get every system and you're not that concerned with plugging in real cartridges or CDs this probably isn't the best move even with the jailbreak it makes a lot more sense to save the money
on this and your next analog console and combine that and get a Mis the Mis experience is just as accurate takes a little more work to get running properly but then you have access to pretty much everything all the way up to PS1 do you regret your playing this now I do not regret my pre-or I got exactly what I thought I was going to get out of the box and the fact that it's already jailbroken means that all of my legally backed up ROMs are easily playable I don't have to burn a bunch of discs to
make that happen and I'm a big fan of easy and consistent like short circuit if you like this video why don't you check out the video where Emily unboxes the analog pocket the device I think is the better option for most people
