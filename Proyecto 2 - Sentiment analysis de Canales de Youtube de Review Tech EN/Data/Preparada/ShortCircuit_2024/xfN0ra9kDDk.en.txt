hey it's me that Gremlin that shows up every six months to torment technology for your viewing pleasure and today is your lucky day because I'm going to be building another PC while I have lots of experience being heavy-handed with computer components I've also learned that they can be quite rugged making it a little less intimidating for beginner PC Builders like me to handle but the one part that I find the most intimidating is picking out the right components for my configuration so
companies like Corsair and NZ XT are creating these build kits to make building a PC for the first time just a bit easier so first thing I'm noticing is we have this bigger box with all of the smaller components and the case on the inside I've been informed that this has already been unboxed once so the way that the components are in the Box currently is not how it will come to you so first we've got the power supply this is the CX 550m which is a semi modular ATX power supply we have the PC
Precision kit it's super awesome that they include one of these if you don't already have an LTT Precision screwdriver we've got our Co Air Vengeance lxp Ram oh this is the motherboard okay motherboard labeling drives me nuts because I have no idea what I'm looking at but this is the pro b760 P Wi-Fi ddr4 motherboard from MSI and then of course the Intel i5 and our graphics card uh 4060 they're stickers personally my favorite part of building PCS and buying PC components is often times they include a
little freebie like that as well as this other not so freebie because I guess you pay for it with your kit but you get a  best Flawless did he break no he's dead breed here's everything out of the box this is the core set they also have a few other options if you're looking to upgrade a bit more but for somebody who's looking to just get their foot in the door this is a great starter option so I'm a very visual person I will often times pick components based on the way they look so I'm interested to see how
this configuration looks Al together but the case itself looks pretty nice let's get it out of the box uh this is the 4000d airflow case from Corsair this is always the scariest part like actually starting to take things apart because now it feels real that I actually have to build a PC again we didn't have instructions in the Box they may have been thrown out when it was first unboxed but thankfully they have their manual online uh so you can easily reference it if you do end up losing
that top sheet or manual remove the motherboard from the packaging and place on the anti-static bag I'm already doing things wrong unpack the CPU and install it into the motherboard so we've got our little Intel uh Core i5 CPU do not remove the plastic cover protecting the CPU socket good thing I read the instructions cuz I almost did that match it with the small Triangle located at the bottom left corner of the CPU socket oh yeah it's right here no pressure I'm so scared I'm sweating
okay oh my God my hands are so shaky did you see that it's like a horror movie   it oh my God I'm so scared oh my gosh okay and  tight this is corsair's DIY Precision screwdriver and we're going to test it out initially but I'll probably swap to the LT Precision screwdriver after the first go around oh okay I appreciate this a lot but it like matches the cover and the the holes on the PC case good on you Corsair we love some brand guideline consistency it it has a magnetic tray
which is nice I I don't want to go all infomercial and start pitching the LTT Precision screwdriver to you but I already have a few notes for Corsair anyways this is I'm going to have to get used to this my hands are so shaky it's the fear I don't want to disappoint the people oh my gosh oh it doesn't have a picture of the SSD installation portion but thankfully I've done this before so I think I know how to do it that was a very satisfying click this looks right now I must put the screw back
in it's not magnetic enough I need a more magnetic precision screwdriver that's where the LT Precision screwdriver comes in handy look at that me no I got to stop doing that I hate screwing anything in because I always strip threads like literally almost every time these oh maybe I'm just screwing in the wrong one wait let's let's try a different screw at least I can say you're getting an authentic uh view of what building a PC for a beginner looks like we have our Co Air Vengeance DDR
for Ram uh this is two 8 GB ones so 16 GB total uh I personally run the Vengeance Ram in my PC but it's the white ones to match everything else and I also know we need to unlock these but I can't remember which two slots I need to put it in so maybe the instructions can help I hate when they use numbers like this I don't have any reference for where I need to start the count from well they're colorcoded in the image but are they not they're not color coded on the motherboard so after building a couple
piec I know now you align this little slot with the little um slot there and then you just push until it clicks little bit of pressure on both sides it's in yay I'm I'm super surprised with how good this is actually going so far oh it goes this way okay so don't install it upside down like I was about to do I think that was my first time ever installing an IO shield and I I think I did a good job can I get a little thank you where's the fan where's the CPU Cooler no no cooler whoever unboxed this
initially Jake tyy uh forgot to put the CPU Cooler back in you're our savior or old be careful not to remove the pre-applied thermal paste found on the bottom side of the air cooler no thermal paste in sight but thankfully we have a tube here all thermal paste applications should be gauged on how dinosaur they are does it look like a dinosaur be honest yes thank you push down the push screws until they click okay I see so there's some little holes here oh this is so scary I haven't
installed a CPU fan like this before okay it kind of looks like these three are incorrect I just need to push this one how is there thermal paste everywhere look it it's here it's here it's on my hand again at least everything will be pasted there's literally thermal paste on this how did that happen how is it all over me like this is this a normal experience for PC Builders to have thermal paste everywhere so I may have missed a step but that's okay we're going to do that
step now by installing the motherboard into the PC case you know what got me is there's no picture of that I want pictures is it all right if I lower the desk a little bit what did you just say a little louder one more time say it we still  sponsor thanks to vti for sponsoring today's video their new Courtside Classics bring a vintage tennis shoe style to their roster and just like their other shoes they come with vess's claim of being 100% waterproof even the brightest sunniest days can turn cloudy
on a whim so your feet need to be ready for any occasion whether that's a surprise Lake day chilling on a boat or one of those long nights in the city in the city the Courtside Class come with a padded tongue and collar plus a lightweight design that makes you feel like you're walking on clouds go snag a pair today using our Link in the description and you'll even automatically get 15% off your entire order a oh I put the io shield in backwards do you remember like 20
minutes ago when I said so don't install it upside down like I was about to do don't don't install it upside down easy fix those are the kind of fixes I live for and I'll take my nicely organized screws with me over here while I screw in the motherboard I can probably stand the PC case up now yay look at how beautiful it doesn't have a graphics card in there yet but I feel pretty good it's nice they're like kind of already cable managed a little bit in the back I appreciate appreciate
that less work for me refer to the motherboard's manual for detailed description of the ports and connections but there are images so I'm going to  images we have this guide now that came with the motherboard so in fact all of these that I'm not sure where they go belong together somewhere okay I figured it out mostly yeah struggling is like a very nice way of saying what was happening there's thermal paste on the table is that where it's coming from unbox the power supply
okay that's next I can pose like like  fish there's a lot of cables with power supply but thankfully from my experience in the past usually there's only one port that these can sort of fit into so it's a little little easier to guess although that way wouldn't be my recommendation I think it goes  here in this little spot right that seems right probably doesn't matter that much aside from the direction the fan is pointing which is currently up but most of the heat is in this area
anyways so maybe it's fine oh okay so it it is the one that's labeled CPU power here but it's labeled differently in the uh instruction died it's not labeled 24 pin but I think it has 24 pins so it's probably right and that goes here because there's literally nowhere else that it will fit we have the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 uh for our graphics card and we are now in the part of the video where I install that so brace yourselves this is going to get  how did they not tell me to install this
or like screw it in at least it's not in  instructions this has to go with this  right is this the right spot this has to be the right spot I took out three this  cringing it clicked yay that was absolutely effortless this grab the PCI cable Oh you mean the cable that I threw here it is it's labeled PCI I don't know why you asked me to do videos let's get the LT the big size LT screwdriver this is way easier with this screwdriver last screws and then we should be ready to turn this on I'm just
kidding could you imagine all that work  boot okay what do they always say unplug it and plug it back in again all right we got to it just lit up okay it's making noises the CPU Cooler is on and so is the fan and so is the other fan oh it might help to plug it into the monitor just in case this happens to you thankfully Corsair has a help portion on their website where they mention what do you do if your PC doesn't turn on uh and they have a support number that you can call so hopefully they can help you
figure it out thankfully I have my own support team here at lmg um but most people don't have the the pleasure of that so as you can see we have the PC up and running you might want to play most games at 1080p although you can try running some in 14 1840 you just might not get the best frame rates uh however with this being their base model version of this build kit uh 1080p isn't necessarily A Bad Thing it works and I built it with ease kind of mostly and a "little bit of help at $1,000 I would say"
this is a success thanks for watching subscribe to short circuit and if you're interested in watching me build another PC I won't blame you if you don't uh I would check out the nzx build kit video that I did on this channel thanks for watching bye
