dang Bae that's the name of the company that reached out to to sponsor this Showcase of their Mars Pro 2 smart projector look at it it's like a fat tall Sonos and look at all these things they have inside the Box paper you can read ShamWow a remote you can talk to and unlike your phone a power supply this compact dense box is a 4K laser projector it actually is an alpd that's Advanced laser phospher display it's 4K at 60 HZ or 1080p at 240 HZ and yes there is a low latency game mode it's
glossy which I guess is why they include the shami actually says dang Bay right on it dang towel so you can wipe your fingerprints off here but you know what  thing nice all right tour of the outside here you can see there are grills on the sides cuz there's speakers in there two 12wt speakers we'll listen to those later and on the back is is all the io headphone jack for secret viewing two USB 2.0 ports an HDMI ARC Port my favorite one then another HMI these are 2.1 a spit if Port then there's a land
port it's probably 100 100 port cuz it's not label otherwise and then your DC Comics Batman power port on the bottom five interesting things four of which are rubber feed and then there's this little quarter-inch threaded type of Mount that you see on the bottom of cameras and some speakers and I think the reason it's on here is because for limited time only actually I don't know about the limited time thing but we have a box uh which I believe houses a gimbal for this thing $140 value wow this is
metal this is like literal metal and it spins that is cool it's like a branded Lazy Susan this base you can see has these tracks on the sides okay boom Oh God included small screws and Allen key huzzah dang Bay nice the knurling on here this is just a nice product color accents this is nice and they say it's $139 $140 value but it's free if you buy it at launch that's a bargain even at 140 bucks which is more than I'd like to pay for a projector gimbal I don't think that's a bad value considering how well
built this thing is and the amount of metal it is why would you even want a gimbal for this well for starters what if you want to project on your ceiling so you can be lying in bed watching movies you can do that with this and because it has all these awesome AI Auto Keystone features you don't even have to fuss around with it being planar on your  presently it's a nice dang girl glossy black power adapter with 180 W output and a Mickey Mouse connector for easy detaching I like a good standardized
cable comes with a nice wide velcro cable tie and a barrel Jack connector that just goes right in there to the top and you might think kind of sucks that that's at the top and not the bottom however that does make it not get in your way as much when you're tilting it it's a really Spartan remote with just a few buttons kind of like an Nvidia Shield remote select in the middle you've got just a few platform specific buttons no Disney plus you got Prime video YouTube and Netflix and we'll get
talk more about the Netflix a little later man stillar looks so stupid on the poster he looks like he's talking to a dog who's your good boy this is is pretty close to the smallest image this projector will throw it'll go down to 40 in and as high as 200 in but they actually recommend for the clearest image for it to be between 80 and 120 in because Beyond 120 the light is just getting spread too thinly and the image will be washed out the colors won't be as as Vivid let's move this thing to get it a little
bigger there you have it I talked smack about this book but this book told me that this side button the black one if you press it it will launch the projector settings menu so I can mess around and do fine tweaks to any of the AI kind of screen fitting settings or I can just make them run again I think focus is good let's check out image correction manual Keystone correction that's what I just was fit the screen automatically align the image with the screen let's see how it does it made it
bigger but it definitely shot off the top you can see there's light bleeding off the top Edge now you can see it did a fairly good job with the auto Keystone but but thankfully they don't make you rely on these features you can manually do it to get it perfect okay so you don't need to move the projector itself to do the zoom level which is awesome because you know sometimes you're not in a situation like me where you have the option of putting on this coffee table or this table sometimes you only have
one spot your projector could reasonably be honestly probably most times image reposition adjust the position of the projected image this is what I need right now because as you can see there's a couple slivers particularly on the on the bottom where the image is too high for the screen all right and finally Advanced Auto Keystone correction after movement that's not on I thought that was on that's crazy I thought that was on this whole time that explains kind of when I first turn around I was like why
why isn't doing anything it was just doing focus it wasn't Auto keystoning I'm going to turn that on that's what I would do and avoid obstacles this is if you want it to automatically display on a wall but there happens to be like a light switch on the wall it'll be smart enough to go to the side of that light switch so that it's not making a hole in   ba cool feature sounded uh a little bit Bassy actually all right now that we're set up let's look at the interface it's
Google TV as you can see it comes with Netflix YouTube and Prime video pre-installed as well as this multimedia player um the cool thing thing about the Netflix is that this is licensed Netflix so unlike at least some Android TV boxes this has licensed Netflix which means it does not use simply the Netflix web app which would result in lower quality Netflix being streamed this uses the official Netflix it's running locally but this is the world's first 4K laser projector with Google TV with licensed
Netflix some HDR content this projector actually supports both HDR 10 plus and hlg which you don't don't always see it's more useful for sports on TV um no Dolby Vision though with hdr on you're "going to get up to 2,450 isol lumens" look at that that that fish just lives on that other fish's fin it's that's like me and lonus because this is shining on a a dark screen like a gray screen it really has low black levels I'm not going to call it OLED like but it with this screen combination it
doesn't look like a glowy gray you could get on some LCD TVs look at that beard oh the good old days but yeah this looks this looks better than that 8K YouTube video we watched a second ago this looks good I can see some detail in the background in the blacks but then his face is nice and bright and well lit it's HDR bro ah David appreciating this video  here God can you imagine a crab just doing this  you it like has this big Pinsir it's like LTT there's the crab I mean this is
pretty close to my head at max volume and I would say it's loud enough but it's pretty close to my head at max volume so um you might want to get a soundar speakers uh to go along with that luckily it does have Bluetooth 5.2 so you could send the audio right over to a soundbar or just plug it in with EC this thing is pretty cool another thing that's great about its Laser Technology is that it will last longer than a traditional projector lamp up to 10 times longer they claim with
"30,000 hour life um and not only that" it'll do that while consuming less energy they claim 73% less energy than a traditional lamp so lasers you don't need to know how they work to know that they work great now that this has been on for a while it's definitely warm but it seems to be doing a good job dissipating in multiple directions I take back what I said about it being a space heater unless you were this close to it so if you're thinking dang I'm going to get one of those for my bay you
"can for $1,900 MSRP but if you buy it" now it's $400 off plus another 50 bucks off using our code which is in the description check it out if you like this video hit like hit subscribe and check out our other projector videos we have a few of them I think even Dan hosted one and everyone loves Dan
