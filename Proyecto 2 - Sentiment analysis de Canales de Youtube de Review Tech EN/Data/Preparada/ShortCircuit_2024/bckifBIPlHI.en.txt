10 years ago I tried what I thought was the future of smart glasses but they freaked a lot of people out they didn't really look like normal person glasses they had a camera on them they were kind of creepy that way but even realities who sponsored this video wants to change that with the even G1 a pair of smart glasses with a display in them and AI functionality all this cool stuff in a pair of glasses that looks dare I say normal Sleek stylish oh so Vogue and honestly those promises uh start right
away with the packaging uh this is a Sleek kind of matte look to it uh what do we got here put them on see what matters and we got the quick guide here spoiler alert I've already looked at this because I've actually been trying the uh even G1 for a little bit and as I was saying the thoughtfulness kind of is apparent in the in the packaging here you bring that that was like a nice little moment here's the glasses themselves very Sleek looking case and oh just a little peek uh this is also
the charging case we'll get to that I want to see what else is in the Box first we got accessories underneath okay a very nicely coiled braided USBC cable which is x amount of meters long let's let's call it 4T ooh feels nice and on this side we have a a microfiber cloth for cleaning because these are real glasses once again a little bag of extra nose pads and warranty and safety information here um so let's read through together just kidding Jake was scared there okay so
that's what's in the main box here but we've also got an extra option that you can add uh in the bottom here which are sunglasses Clips they got a little uh fade on them a little gradient do they fit on my glasses do they look good yeah actually wow I mean that honestly goes to their design philosophy here which is that they're trying to create glasses and I guess as well the sunglass attachment that will fit multiple different shapes but most importantly one that will fit
their actual glasses so these are the even G1 themselves and you can see right away what I'm talking about here I mean if I didn't tell you that these were tech product you might ask why why do you have what are these doing here but other than that they look like you know they look like a nice pair of glasses should I put them on everybody so these actually have my prescription lenses in them so I won't even need to yeah by the way this is what I look like with no glasses I know here we go what do you
think am I a wizard but yeah the design and feel of the even G1 is very very premium it's got this kind of like matte finish on the entire thing it's apparently built with magnesium and titanium Alloys so like the lenses themselves are very rigid and strong while the the arms here are a little flexy so you get a little bit of give in those which I appreciate they use this patented screwless hinge design which I very much appreciate as someone whose uh other glasses I'm already talking about
them as my other glasses it's like a it's like a loose door this one's stiff which is like even more frustrating I think so anyways this is this this won't happen they also have some water resistance to splashes and light rain so that's nice to see but having said that you can kind of like feel the nubbin back there it's not like a weight situation the reason that the they included the touch pads and some of the tech back here behind the ear is so that the balance and the weight of it
you know is not really noticeable if they put this stuff up front maybe it would feel a little bit topheavy but as oh I got an email from Linus which I can see thanks to the wave guide displays integrated into these glasses and that's like one of the main things that these smart glass companies have been struggling with is a way to put a display on glasses that doesn't make it you know weigh the whole front of your face down some of those other smart glasses had this big chunky thing at the
top of the glasses so from the outside it kind of looked like you might be wearing smart like like regular glasses but they would be out from your face like this so the fact that there is a display integrated into these lenses very impressive the way you activate it they have a accelerometer in here I guess you can look up slightly and then the uh dashboard will show up showing you the date uh calendar event that you might have coming up weather notifications time and on the right side
is a section that you can pin a quick note to and that is going to bring us into features okay apparently the guys can see the green LED from the display right here so at certain angles people might be able to tell that you are cheating on the test or something so I should clarify that unlike you know a VR headset the display moves with you as you as you move around so there's no like vr/ true like locking things in space type of augmented reality the way the display appears is like kind of a a
floating rectangular shaped space about 2 m away from you that shows you stuff "in green text it can go up to 1,000 nit" of brightness so it can deal with being outside although using the sunglasses uh helps a lot with that on a bright day I mean driving here this morning wearing these it basically looks like a heads up display like in a fighter jet that which I have been in many times they've also got in the app uh some other stuff here translate you can do live translate
we're going to try that out in a second teleprompt they can display a script as a video host that's a very interesting uh option and there's even an even AI that you can talk to by holding on the touchpad on the right here and it'll start recording it's listening to me right now and I'm just going to keep talking to see what it thinks about that if you're looking for an AI powered tool to record and analyze your voice in real time here are some options you might consider and then it gives me a bunch of
options when I use the AI it provides me with a visible text answer and when there's multiple pages that I can cycle through by hitting the right touchpad or close it by double tapping on the left touchpad so that pretty convenient after having used it for a few days I've gotten used to the process there something like a speaker would be a lot more necessary in smart glasses that don't have a built-in display but because you can get the answer like without even sitting through hearing an
AI being like here are the results of your search it is nice just to have the text there instead of having to sit through that one of the most kind of everyday useful features that I thought was included here is the quicknote feature so you can tap and hold on the right touchpad and it'll start recording a quick note you can say all sorts of things to it I'm recording a short circuit video right now about the even G1 I have so many thoughts it's hard to get them out it'll actually display kind
of a summary of that note if you put your head up to see the dashboard currently recording a short circuit video about the even G butn have many thoughts to express thank you that is how I feel that's not what I said for btim but you can once you tap into the note in the app it'll give you the AI summary here but you can also go and say oh what did I actually say ah that was the word vomit and give me the more succinct version thank you I can imagine that this would be very useful in
scenarios where oh you just remember something that you have to get from the grocery store so you just make a quick note or you're working on something creative and a thought occurs to you you take the quick note and even if you your thoughts are very jumbled the AI can kind of summarize it for you now you'll see me kind of like constantly looking up over here to the left it's because there's big lights over here so if I look up and I'm looking right at the lights the text gets blown out so
there's a dark section over here that I can see it much easier and but it's it's rude to you and I'm sorry also in the app here at the very top you can adjust the height of the display for where the glasses you know sit on your nose um so for where I have them right here I have it near the bottom of the available space but you can move it up and down there's kind of like that this range so like actually I can see the display in that entire range I think when I first calibrated this I was wearing the
glasses slightly differently because now I can put them basically at the very bottom and it's right in my field of view so I'm looking at the camera and I can see the text but also if you want to change the angle at which the heads up display activates at any time you can go into the settings here and manually adjust the angle so I'm just going to put it at zero and then it should activate just it just just be there it went away and then I look up and it comes back okay so that's great so other
than the quick notes the other kind of everyday feature that I find very useful is the notifications it will forward notifications from your phone to the glasses you'll get a little uh icon on the display showing that you have a notification then to see the whole thing you can put your head up and read the email like I did previously over here you got brightness so you can have it on automatic brightness or you can adjust the brightness so that it's just super bright all the time or lower or just
Auto which I like better I just figured out that silent mode refers to being visually silent uh so if you put if you tap silent mode then the display will just kind of turn off okay now let's look at one of the less everyday features potentially depending on your situation translate it's got live translating so when someone's talking you in a different language you can have the translated text of what they're saying displayed on the glasses so there's two tiers of the translate
feature translate basic which kind of does sentence by sentence it waits for the sentence to complete and then gives you the translation and translate Pro which will go more in real time like word by word oh hi Oliver hey can you say can you whisper sweet nothings to me in Chinese and see if the glasses can so this is just telling you that at normal eye level I'm going to see the transl ated text into English but if I want to see the characters I can you know the original Chinese I can look up to see it
it won't mean anything to me but the options there okay  Oliver yes my name is Oliver and I love ice cream wait Bing chilling means ice cream in Chinese yes sir what's your favorite flavor of ice cream what you want choc I I love chocolate this is the basic tier and I feel like it the words are keeping up pretty quick I'm I'm fairly impressed okay we're trying and translate Pro now and Oliver  goodness Jess oh yeah my it said my French is not very good but I try the title of your
Memoir yeah so that was faster the words were showing up as you were saying them instead of kind of waiting but the having said that basic is still pretty good like I didn't really feel like I was missing something big when you were speaking in Chinese and it was giving me full sentences now obviously that's useful for people who are in situations where people are speaking you know languages they don't speak but I've also seen people uh saying that they're they find this feature useful for people who
may be hard of hearing speaking of seeing words on the display the teleprompt feature is as I said very useful to a video host like me who would be able to just read a script uh off their glasses as weird as that is to say you can either just make a new teleprompt entry here and paste in text like I did with this section of the TechLink script or you can also import uh files from your device so let's test this out let's pretend I'm a TechLink so you can have it so that the
teleprompting text only shows up when you look up or you can just have it always on you have three options for scrolling the text in teleprompt mode you have Auto which just will choose a constant speed and just go with that speed no matter what you have manual so you can tap through the pages using the touchpads and then AI which autof follows the content based on your reading and I'm just going to skip right to that one because that sounds interesting okay prompt me YouTube
appears to be testing Tik Tock Style video swiping on long form videos on their mobile app in what can only rationally be described as their dumbest experiment yet for reasons I shall explain I'm going to stop now because it's keeping up very well it's like the words that I'm saying are graying out and now it's confusing because I totally went off script I'm breaking the AI you can't control me okay wait if I come back to the script will it know a platform which recently started Autos
scrolling to a new video when the one you're watching in full screen ends it kept up okay just to see if the AI can keep up with me speaking really fast I'm going to go YouTube appears to be testing Tik Tok Style video swiping on long form videos on their mobile app and what can only rationally be described as their dumbest experiment yet for reasons I shall explain their test causes the swipe up action to scroll another video into view as confirmed by an official Forum post and was demonstrated in a
screen recording posted by tar meta on Twitter a platform which recently it kept up now the last main feature we can see in the dashboard of the app here is navigate now this focuses on walking and cycling directions not driving uh which I agree with because it's not smart to you know try to get people to look at a display while they're should be focusing on the road operating a motor vehicle despite that I did that this morning and indeed it had some trouble keeping up uh
because I was going so fast I was taking a route that it told me not to take so it was like what are you doing but I've heard others say that the navigate feature is useful for their cycling situations so take that as you will the maps are powered by mapbox Maps but in my experience you can still search and find you know anything that you would expect to find using other map Services once you enter navigation mode it'll kind of have a constant overlay at ey level it's got turn right over here with
the distance until you have to do that the estimated time it'll take you to get there and a little mini map on the right but if you look up you can see the more complete kind of overview map of your rout which is nice to kind of check that and see whether you're going completely off course overall I got to say I'm pretty impressed with the functionality that is baked into this like normal glasses looking product like the even G1 that said I have a couple things that I would wish to see the notifications for
one you can read the notifications but there's no way to interact you can't you know record a message to send back to them and on that note for the AI I'm really missing the ability to kind of use it as an assistant in the style of like Google Assistant where you can hold the hold the button down and say send a message to this person or what's my battery percentage at so thankfully even realities has begun open sourcing the even g1's source code so Vel opers can start making their own apps and adding
features tweaking things so hopefully we can see lots of different new ways to interact with these glasses in the future laser eyes just an idea so the even G1 uh one of a very very small group of uh products in the world right now that integrate this waveguide display into a totally normall looking pair of glasses unless you look behind the ears because of all that they are kind of expensive they start at $600 for the non-prescription version $750 for the prescription lenses and then another
$100 if you want to add this sunglass clip on join my Matrix team think about it now if you're down for all of that but you don't like the round glasses uh even reties does have a square shaped model that they say we be dropping now but for me I feel like these look pretty okay on my face and I think I actually might keep wearing these for a little bit they're my prescription just to kind of you know be be even more distracted than I am normally see how far I can really take things thanks again to even
realities for sponsoring this video and thanks to you for watching like the video if you liked it subscribe to short circuit if you want to do that as well see you later
