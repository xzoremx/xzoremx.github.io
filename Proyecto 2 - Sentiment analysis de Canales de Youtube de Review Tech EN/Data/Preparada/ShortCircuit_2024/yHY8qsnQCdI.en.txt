the M25 by estam comes with one of the most unusual takes on intellectual property that I've ever seen this device has pre-installed more than 30 copyright games that's right friends this is one of those pirated game consoles if users need to install other game programs they should pay attention to the copyright of the content if there are disputes or other liabilities caused by copyright it has nothing to do with our company brother you guys ripped off a PlayStation portal and put a lot more
than 30 pirated games on it the website claims "30,000 pirated games and there's a lot" more to be fascinated by back here it runs Linux has a 3D rocker and offers excellent 4K image quality on its 480 in X 272 in display now I'm not American so inches are not really my measurement of choice but I think you might mean 480 pixels x 272 pixels on a 4 in display how big is this 4.3 in however in spite of all that I'm actually kind of stoked on this thing which means it's a good thing it
has an anti-skid design otherwise no wonder where it would be safe for my excitement I think they mean the grippy tops on the on the joysticks W it boots up pretty fast it turns off immediately this is just is this switch just power just cut the power got what appears to be an air intake over here and then I don't know there's another one but that seems to be blocked no obvious exhaust mini HDMI out though so you can hook it up to your TV headphone jack micro SD slot and USBC
charging oh uh okay I had heard that the triggers had an issue getting caught on the housing I didn't expect it to happen the very first time I touched them well they seem to be okay now got our shoulder buttons over here pretty mushy face buttons I would say and a usable d-pad but I mean realistically what are your expectations for something like this plus minus here appears to be for volume control and then we've got start and select both of them are labeled home I guess they couldn't be bothered to do
another mold that doesn't have home on it the joystick seem again functional enough oops did I launch something how did that happen I'm sure that was on me the U interface is just it's a Linux drro that's sort of heed towards emulation that that was probably not on them uh what also isn't on them is this message from our sponsor dbrand who is promoting dark PL really they're promoting dark plates do those guys ever miss an opportunity to kind of like twist the knife on Sony if you want your
PlayStation 5 to look a little less like a PlayStation 5 and more like a PlayStation 5 with dark plates on it they've got a bunch of different styles and they even offer Innovations like cooling holes sorry I mean speed holes but they don't make it go faster faster they make it run cooler let's play a game I've played before so I know how it should compare to the original experience played a ton of this as a kid there's a bit of a weird moare on the screen uh that's not visible in person it actually looks
pretty darn good uh the sound is not very good this game actually has a banger soundtrack oh yeah here we go bring it on uh Ed or Bonsai I think dang it okay got him you know what though for all my complaints about the d-pad and the um the ABX y being kind of mid um and like the travel is longer than I'd like to see on the d-pads and stuff like I'm not quick on it it's definitely good enough with that said I'm not trying to play a fighting game or anything like that the
question now is how it's going to handle more demanding systems it's got a pretty basic quad core cortex a55 processor from Rockchip with a pretty mid Mai G CPU so I got to say it's a pretty complete seeming package man I am I am sucking right now get out of here oh man flashbacks anyway no issues running SNES games that crappy frame rate is true to the original game and actually this kind of low Fidelity audio sounds pretty okay on the speakers and I quite like the screen as well it seems
accurate enough that it wouldn't bother me of course Super Nintendo not the most demanding thing why don't we step things up a generation and move to the N64 which trigger oh man those triggers are terrible okay now to evaluate the joysticks dude these dead zones I don't even know how to deal with this like I might as well be using the d-pad at this point oh this is really difficult to deal with with that said the emulation smoothness other than those couple of  earlier dude I have no fine control I
don't know if I can I don't know if I can do this I'm just I'm going to get one green shell and that's going to be  star ah got him let's go the joysticks are terrible however the emulation performance so far has been pretty decent that's not a lot of PlayStation games that kind of makes sense though this is the 128 gig version I don't have uh oh oh you just pull it CHF memory card I have no idea who you are but I guess you probably make good memory cards how am I playing a game right
now no no it's not it's not in the ram o  jump oh yeah oh yeah no no no this way harder than it looks fudge never get out of here no did I just do like amazing the first time and it's like impossible to clear it again oh no I got it I got it I got it you know that game does make me wonder though if the timing was so difficult because of input legs so I'm going to play a game I'm really familiar with and see how it feels on this uh where's my Super Mario World at let's go wait there's no Super Mario World on
games oh no touchcreen a bit of a downer that didn't even occur to me there's no Mario games wait there was Mario Kart hold on a sec what it had Mario Kart 64 on it and he recommended this game yeah I don't think I can really blame the input lag on this for my woses everything that's on here should run pretty okay and yeah this experience is something that could easily be recreated by installing EMC on basically anything and loading some ROMs onto it but the package here is not the worst value it
is it 90 bucks and it's amazing how much value you can deliver to your customers when you infringe other people's IP and except no disputes or other liabilities caused by copyright it has nothing to do with our company so I can't promote buying this thing but what I can say is if I was trying to keep my kids busy in the backseat on a long road trip there's certainly worse ways to do it in conclusion these pirate consoles raise all kinds of legal and ethical concerns but I'm not going to tell you what you
should or shouldn't buy what I will tell you is if you spend your about $90 I think on the 128 gig version of this one there are a few usability issues the thumb sticks suck the emulation performance is okay and the triggers do get stuck as we saw in some reviews online so you might be able to kind of shave the plastic down a little bit and alleviate that but I don't think there's anything you're going to be able to do about the joysticks so make of that what you will And subscribe to Short Circuit
