TT Precision multi-bit screwdriver popup we're coming to you live and uh Hey guys want to say hi to YouTube hi woo let's go so we are man this has been so much work to bring bring this product to life if you guys have watched our short circuit videos anytime we're taking something apart lately you'll probably have seen our new Precision multibit screwdriver and maybe our bit storage case including detachable magnetic Parts tray um but this is the first opportunity for people to try it in
person and we are not only going to be getting people's live Impressions so that you can buy with confidence on LTT store.com but I am also going to be challenging some members of the crowd today to beat me at a computer or Electronics disassembly reassembly challenge of some sort they handed me these two sheets of paper literally four minutes before I went live so I haven't even seen any of the challenges but before we do a challenge I am supposed to unbox the Precision screwdriver ah
yes here we go packaging designed by the one and only Sarah but featuring kind of an x-ray view of our Precision screwdriver it's made of anodized aluminum and features an incredibly strong magnet to help keep your bits in place these bits um you need need more like our underwear if you want to keep the other bits in place uh what what if you didn't want potty humor you could tune into a different Channel anyway the point is the magnet's nice and strong so you can not only hold on to small
Precision screws but even larger screws or our bits um it has in-handle bit storage for up to three bits this is something that's pretty cool if you're working on a project where you realistically don't need that many bits but you want to have quick access to them and you don't want to dig the the entire bit storage kit out of your bag or whatever the case may be so those can sit in there for you like that this by the way also uses magnetic action compared to the retaining pin in our
full-size screwdriver so it should functionally never wear out but anything wears out it's kind of how I never like to say anything is waterproof because water literally makes canyons in the earth so nothing is waterproof uh it uses a ceramic hybrid Ball Bearing in the top so not only does that give you incredibly smooth action in your palm when you are using the screwdriver or if you prefer the finger on the top but it also acts as a phenomenal fidget spinner and hey do we
have any of the um the alternate bit ends here can someone bring me those I can show you they are actually swappable so if you like the flat stock one you can go with that but if you prefer a convex yeah here we go here we go here we go so these are user swappable if you prefer a convex top we have that available to you as well and that's great for palming and then if you prefer the concave top that's really great for people who like to put the finger in here and then spin it this way or
however the case may be and we've got a little kit of all the different ones that you can uh just SP on my desk pad it doesn't matter uh we've got a kit and you guys can swap it out with whatever you like uh and that's everything I'm supposed to say it's $29.99 us available now LTT store.com and don't take my word for it being any good how long is your leash and Andy H how far can we go we can go a little bit we can go a little bit yeah I just want to hear from someone who's uh tried it out next to
the competition how much here here here I got your I got your train bride okay here we go here we go all right let's let's come on over to the table where people are trying it out do do we have enough tether yeah yeah we got some tether hey what's up guys this is the table where people are uh trying out our Precision kit next to competing Precision kits uh talking to the members of the engineering team and design team who worked on everything from the uh the ID of the product to the functionality
of the product to the packaging so we've got Sebastian over there we've got Sarah we've got tinan uh Kyle was kicking around here a little while ago but uh let's oh hello hello sir uh can you can you tell us have you have you tried out our Precision driver have you tried out some others what you I sold on one the other ones like there everything is a screwdriver and it will drive the screws but I like with the Precision one that the fidget part about that that's that's
what sold it we see you we see you yeah  audience it just goes it just goes folks fantastic I want to try putting an air compressor up to it we've tried it uh hey hey tinan tinan U when you blasted it with the air compressor how long did  for Sebastian how long does It Go for with the air compressor the air compressor minutes 3 minutes apparently also and it breaks the bearing so don't do that oh okay uh okay don't do that we're not encouraging that warrant yeah we have told you the answer so you don't
have to find out for yourself okay let's find someone else who's trying it this is completely unscripted guys so for all I know they're going to tell me that it's crap and I'm crap and you're crap what do you think hold on we got a mic we got a mic well I uh bought it before I had a chance to take a look at it I do need a new screwdriver just for like fixing things up like I'm trying to pop open my steam deck get a new back cover cuz that broke exactly but honestly good
tool good tool for the job and I'm about to try it for the first time wait you haven't tried it yet I haven't had a chance to well why are we even talking to you there all right all right let's see oh that's a different fit hold up I put random bits in the top I wouldn't even try real funny if there wasn't a Phillips in here no there isn't I put completely random ones in there no no there's Phil there's Phillips in the bit all right I don't want to mix the bits oh jeez there we are all
right is there a screw in here no I gamble super super hard at these kinds of events because I have no idea what  say oh I didn't mention the diamond uh Diamond nerling nice and grippy like I spun the I spun the thing for the the stickers and stuff but yeah know that is is it not magnetic yeah it's magnetic oh it is magnetic okay I'm just I'm just you're  open oh don't quit my day job oh I I feel it could be a captive screw no no we got it we got it all right the bit now now what are the 
screw I assume this has been tested before nope oh there we go LTT first let's go all right fantastic let's get let's get one more first impression maybe from someone who's actually tried it this time got him who's uh who's tried out the driver and some of the competitors here all right okay let's let's get some somebody dropped the badge let's get get some unedited thoughts did did you did you buy one today uh no I have not B one you've not bought one okay so what are you thinking um get in there b get in
there um it seems really not oh is that outside of this magnetic uh so instead of a retaining pin like on the fullsize driver we use a magnetic mechanism which we switch to for a more satisfying feel and for better durability in the long very long term the retaining pin mechanism is still very good but yes so they're so there is a magnet that you screw can stick to the side that's not a feature that's just all right just a thing but this is magnetic here yeah yeah awesome what
what what Precision screwdriver kits have you tried today or do you have experience with in the past over here today okay the moo yeah this one um the bearing at the top these two um this one uh kind of rubbery not the best this however really nice it's extremely satisfying it feels durable and all metal this one is like rubber plastic the bottom line though the bottom line are you going to buy one you don't have to there's no pressure uh I probably probably if I have enough money in my bank account I
will all right cool awesome what are you going to use it for what's the first project you have in mind uh probably just messing around with my computers at home I tend to take a lot of stuff apart I've murdered several laptops but relatable all right let's make our way back to the set well that went well you know you never know uh we did have we did have some people that gave us some pretty pointed criticism when we did the popup at the original screwdriver launch so it is never a guarantee what people are
going to say but that's what we believe in right like if that's our whole thing as an independent media organization then we have to believe in people having access to unfiltered independent viewpoints when they're making a purchasing decision Vision so uh I'm breathing a little bit easier now than I was when we started this exercise but uh hey you got to practice what you preach right I have no idea how many people are even watching this hey Dan how's the stream going are people
sending in any merch messages yeah let's see we've already got uh Do not sit on this table get out of my table we've already got 66 uh 296 orders and we've been live for 14 minutes oh can you wow yeah thank you very much for your patronage folks um if you're not sure how to send a merch message all you got to do on LTT store.com is add an item to your cart and when we're live streaming you're going to see a little box there to fill out a merch message don't send a Super
Chat don't send twitch bits any of that stuff uh we believe that if you're going to throw money at your screen you should get something in return like a high quality product a t-shirt a screwdriver uh I don't know we we have we have a a towel we have a pretty etic we have a pretty eclectic selection of uh of products on LTD store.com so uh we might respond to you Dan curate some merch messages for us to reply to on the stream I got some already okay so we'll do a couple of those right now or Dan
might reply to you via text or forward it internally to someone who can get you an answer but one way or another we will try and get you some kind of acknowledgement even if it's just a little popup at the bottom of the screen thank you so much for your merch messages Dan do you want to show us how the curator cards work love the content what was your favorite part of the newest scrapyard Wars oh oh oh you cheated okay I talked to Luke after the show he was ribbing me so hard he was like
yeah my favorite part my absolute favorite part was oh dude oh I just thought of another one oh it's so good this it's by far the best scrapyard Wars ever scrapyard Wars 9 okay it's tied it's tied oh no I thought of a third one okay it's a three-way tie between Sammy nailing the blind box penguin dude that was such a moment you have like it gets cut down in the edit but you guys have no idea how long we sat there deliberating which blind box to buy because we knew the judge we were
pandering to and I think I think that play I think that play put us over the top also absolutely love sniping Luke on that deal on Craigs List knowing at the time that he was going to go for it and buying it just to block him dude and the fact that we were right love it and then my third favorite is when Luke completely not knowing it was us messaged us trying to buy something that we were trying to flip we figured out it was him and like we're like haha good try Luke when we totally could have
sold it for more than we ended up selling it for if we had sold it to Luke so those were were those were my three favorite moment oh man number four being in Disguise and getting recognized because I pulled up in a dbrand rap Porsche tyan what why would you do that I didn't I well so I thought of it dude I thought of it I parked in what I thought was the back but I didn't understand the layout of the housing  up anywh who we should probably uh okay oh actually Dan you want to hit me with
one more merch message sure let's See's more for the people hi lonus and everyone at the popup shop thanks for updating my screwdriver collection of all the computers you have ever owned which one was your favorite my computer is a PC of thesias I still have thumb screws in my computer from probably about 2003 or 2004 so I intentionally do not replace things that I don't have to replace until probably two years ago I was running a D5 pump that was I think by the end it had served me for almost
10 years like I I don't believe in buying stuff to replace things that are perfectly good that's one of the reasons actually that we went out of our way to make our screwdriver can someone bring me an iix IT kit from the table there please we went out of our way to sell our screwdriver driver separately for a reasonable price and we made it drop in compatible even if it's not quite the exact same shape cuz we had some of our own ideas about ergonomics but we made it drop in compatible with iFixit kits
because if you guys already have like perfectly good bits you shouldn't be replacing those we don't want you to replace those if you don't have bits by all means buy some from us we've got a really nice kit that's got built-in you know magnetic screw management and stuff like that like Yeah by all means we'll sell you that but we don't want people unnecessarily wasting and we don't want people to see this as like you know an Fu to iix it they are a longtime valued partner of ours uh their mission is
something that we are 100% aligned with uh we're going to continue to work with them as long as they want to work with us and we are absolutely never going to be able to approach their scale in terms of the replacement parts the Partnerships that they've built with companies like valve for example for replacement parts for the steam deck um all the guides that they have like this is this product is not nearly as useful without I fix it so just want to shout those guys out we love everything that
they do it's just that I'm real particular about my tools and there were some things that I thought could be a little bit better for a more premium product we're not even really price competitive with them and so that's why we created our Precision multibit screwdriver that simple but yeah we don't we don't want people to waste right why don't we not waste any more of your time and jump right into our first challenge which I will be learning about at the same time as our first contestant
so come on up who's our who's our first  are these are randoms from the crowd and you can tell cuz he kind of looks like an NPC in cyberpunk no no I need that you can't cheat off this all right are you ready for our first good are you ready for our first challenge not really do you know how to build a PC it's been 3 years so no perfect cuz we're not really building one we're upgrading one we need more storage oh okay we have two Min Forum PCS here and we need to upgrade the nvme
SSD oh no so this larger one has a little bit harder screws to remove but in the smaller one you're going to need to pry it open to get inside so you're going to flip it over undo the Phillips screws on the bottom all right your choice you don't want to pry the plastic no okay all right I don't want to break it yeah I I get it I get it all right so you're going to flip it over undo the fillips head screw CR replace mvme screw it in screw it back up and whoever's done first wins a glorious prize there's
a prize there's a prize I thought the prize is just beating him I'll keep the prize so you win a bonus prize true but if you lose you'll still be leaving with a lovely prize so try your darnest and let's see who wins I'll count you down and on go you'll get started now it's not that I don't want you to have the prize but I'm a very competitive person I don't know anything to the point my computer blue screens every time I wake it up so okay so what you're saying is I shouldn't have to try that hard no
either that or you are the most devious PC repair shark that I have ever encountered all right all right unboxing your screwdriver there you got to be on the same same plan field oh yeah yeah yeah you can go ahead you can throw it inside your kid there you go all right I'm going to way all the way down want to on go 3 2 1 go all right Dan do you want to hit me with some merch messages while I'm uh sitting here working on computers oh absolutely all right let's do it let's see what we
got getting my first 1.5 LTT screwdrivers any plan to make colored end caps for the Precision love me some blue do we plan to make them uh Hey chewy do you want to go get some of the Creator Edition end caps we've done sure I'm not sure if that's something that we really want to talk about yet but um we just talked about it hey we're talking about it check this out check out check out this magnet action Andy so I undid this screw look at the size of that screw boys let's
go can't even get it off I should ad ad meant I'm missing my mom's b day for this worth it you already lost regardless of the outcome I told her I'd buy your dinner so okay all right okay maybe with your wonderful prize you can give it to her hopefully all right oh look at that oh man you're in trouble brother I know oh whoops I'm trying to I'm trying to undo an .2 screw with a flathead the flattest head is mine Dan hit me with another merch message sure I got loads here sh hey lldd I love your
screwdriver backpack and shirts look forward to this one too what's your biggest regret technology-wise what do you wish you had learned sooner or not gotten into to start with oh man I think my biggest regret technology wise is more something that I haven't gotten into I have had sitting at the top of my personal too list document for probably 3 years learn some 3D modeling because I think in this Modern Age with how gamechanging um like additive manufacturing uh like 3D printing has become there's just no
excuse for not being able to make basic things like a little adapter or a little wall mount or something like that for yourself and it's something that I've un has fortunately taken off at a time when it's easy for me to lean on the crutch of having one of the incredible members of my team do it for me and so I just haven't really learned it and I I I would like to I'd like to set aside some time for myself to do that because you know when I put in the time I can get pretty good at things but when I don't
spend the time it's just it's so easy you got kids you got the company you got a you know marriage to hold together when you're you're kind of hard to get along with sometimes right oh hey here we go this is great so check this out guys these are some of the experiments we've done um you you can absolutely get a Precision screwdriver today the end caps are swappable if you're just tuning in we have encap sets that have either convex concave or a black uh a black regular one to sort of change up the
look of your screwdriver and in the future is possible that we will offer multicolored endcaps or special edition end caps this is a really cool experimental one that we made right now though these are going to be exclusive to creators just like we did Creator editions of the regular screwdriver and sent those out to uh some of our some of our favorites in the tech and repair space uh we're going to let them be the only ones to have the special colors for now but here's a here's a good look at
some of the Andy are you going to yeah here's here's a good look at some of the things that we have in mind from our anodization partner pretty cool huh I don't know which one's my favorite I love this pink just the kind of luster it has it reminds me of like uh like those Pearl style helium balloons that's very Niche I'm trying to kill time for you while I know I told you I don't know anything here yeah so here there's some there's some technique there's some technique to it okay so so
you want to you want to use the oh yeah no these screws are a little tougher okay so I would say probably your best technique for these is this but my screws were a little looser so I was able to kind of take the top and spin it with the nerling the cool thing about Precision drivers is there's as many ways to use them as there are kind of people out there um and and you you used it I used it wrong no you're doing you're doing great you're doing great yeah see I should have done that yeah
see it takes a little bit of has a machinist I would know this but no you're you're doing great you're doing great it's nerves it's nerves okay so what's his consolation prize cuz I think might have won consolation prize today is a signed short circuit banana signed by me great that's awesome congrats man thank you man that's limited there's not many of those all right thanks for playing three more right here all right take care all right who am I taking on next Dan do you want to hit me with a merch
message while they bring up the next contestant sure might as well uh when are we getting LT power tools okay we have some pretty cool ideas for the power tool space we have a lot of expertise to build up internally I think that we're going to take a lot of the learnings from our uh oh uh is Nick somewhere I Nick light Nick light Nick light uh I saw him I saw him earlier uh well anyway we have a project hey  contestant all right well we'll get to that in a second but we have a project
we're working on that's going to teach us a lot about lithium batteries and I think that that's something that we're going to have to learn about before we were to tackle anything resembling a power tool oh good it's Nick light yeah yeah okay so no I'll get to you in a moment sir um the thing that working on the have we talked about that at all uh no okay so I probably shouldn't talk about that I would prefer if you didn't okay okay I respect that I respect that okay yeah I respect that do do you actually
though no I do I do I do well cuz we're still pretty far away on it I will I will I will say it's a totally new totally new development for us um and should we just say like what Nate's specialty is to give people a hint I said we were going to learn a lot about batter sure I think that's a fair hint okay all  you Nate's been I think that's been his main hey yo like when did Nate start cuz that's been his main project basically day zero right yeah it's been it's over a year it's over a year
just to give you guys some idea of how how new this is that's not all he's been working on he's working very hard all that stuff no no I'm not saying that I'm just saying there's been a lot of development and there's there's been a lot to learn um and we're not we're not going to accept it until it's great has to be perfect yeah sorry bad word not the p word but it has to be great so is band okay um okay where'd Luke go where' Luke go does it is there an extra challenge that we can have Luke
do or I I don't know can can can Luke participate is he allowed to participate what am I doing uh well I'm people are competing against me to do some kind of electronics thing and uh why we have a challenge for you two oh nice all right this is a very technical challenge that requires this screwdriver in particular okay Luke's already got a head start it's who can spin the endcap the longest oh wow he's got particular practice in this but Luke it will be winning for the crowd okay I
can see we're both already like well the sand blasted side's a little grippier lining it up that's the that's the thing I like about Luke it doesn't matter how low the stakes are he will compete to the point of exhaustion I don't even know what the stakes are um are you ready get one shot one shot on go okay and Dan are you going to hit us with some merch messages okay three nice and tight Andy two one go crap I think I might have gotten a Bad spin I might have gotten a Bad spin

so uh the way I see it I'm du for a w here Marcus would you say you're a gamer uh yeah sometimes would you say you're a retro gamer not really but I do sometimes enjoy retro games all right well good luck this is SK Stick it to them you're going to replace the analog stick in a GameCube controller for your instructions you will flip the controller over use a y bit to unscrew the six screws that hold the back of the GameCube controller together you're going to take apart the controller Don't
Be Afraid some buttons come loose you're going to get to the front PCB where the analog stick is attached pop it off replace it with a new one uh and they're keyed so make sure you put it in the same way uh seat all the buttons back in the right position in the front of the controller you got to make sure they're all in Linus no have and don't take all the buttons out I would I would never take the buttons out and not put them in all right except in that short circuit a
little while ago exactly and then you're put the two halves of the controller back together and screw it back together wow this is a big one okay do you feel confident this Marcus nope lonus do you feel confident in this um I have never personally worked on this particular controller so I'd say my confidence is a three out of five three out of five well five we will give you a head start Marcus when you get three screws undone then L's going to start cuz he's a three out of five it's only
fair unbelievable all right why don't we get started take a look at this beautiful screwdriver too what do you think are you going to get one today I already have one we love to hear it yeah it's awesome Screwdriver from what I've seen there's still things that I can glean from watching him I can figure out where the triwing is Dan why don't you hit with a a merch message get him distracted wow yeah let just track L wow you're going to be like that y lonus i inherited a house recently and I'm
shocked by how expensive seemingly innocuous house things are what was the most unexpectedly expensive thing for your house oh my God I don't know if it was unexpected because I literally worked in the industry before um but I still got sticker shock and still was so upset to get my first quote for house painting I was like bro if I don't spend this money I literally lose tens of thousands dollars worth of having to replace my siding at some point in the future but if I do spend this
money I'm getting like 500 bucks worth "of paint and I'm spending like $6,000" worth of people hucking it at the wall and I and and respect for the people who do that job it's tough It's it's sweaty labor it's like very intense and it can be scary sometimes getting up high and you know fighting with paint sprayers and kind of equipment that doesn't always work real well but uh yeah it just sucks how much it costs um I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about something that doesn't suck if you've
been paying very close attention you might have noticed that our bits are a little bit longer than the standard bits that you might find on a lot of other Precision screwdriver sets and that's not to say that the entire bit is longer we didn't want to have super long bits because we didn't want to have like the world's thickest bit case but the shank is a little longer so that means that when you're tackling a project like this uh like this GameCube controller you can actually get into this recessed area in
a way that you wouldn't necessarily be able to I just to warn you you are way behind I poor man AB have a job to do you he he's nailing this so far what is happening over here he's going so fast what happened to the motor I we won't test the game to controller so as long as it looks together you're probably okay oh my God you know I do respect the hustle I thought all the piece had to be inside but um at least this bumper does have to be inside cuz you can see this can you I'm I'm catching up boys you
know we want to see lonus loose so I'll let catch up Bo uhoh no the screwdrive the screws came out what did I just do what did I just do okay all right L you could win I think I've got everything lined up slow and steady slow and steady the race slow and steady wins the race ladies and gentlemen uh you might be going a little too slow and steady oh what happened to my what happened to my stupid thing here get the oh get this get this thing in the thing I need the thing in the thing I can't get it in the
thing here we go here we go no I can't get the thing all right Dan can you pull up some merch messages for Marcus it seems like he'll be done early okay let's see Marcus uh I don't know love the team's energy is a Precision a good match for the full-sized LTT screwdriver what synergies were discussed uh Precision a good screwdriver it works well I don't own the big one for at this man a big one and I'm  no beat by three screws four lus exactly the Head Start all right what's he
walking away with your priz today is a 144 gaming monitor from MSR oh my God thank you what this feels even better cuz it's coming out of linus' wallet what wait whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on time out why is that zip tie outside of the controller there's a zip tie uh that looks right to me yeah I don't see a problem the challenge was to replace the stick whoa whoa whoa whoa Marcus you better leave if you got to take this m you got to go the shoulder button where's the shoulder button that's like
the little brother controller it just looks like I have a shoulder button in mind shoulder get out of here thank you there's your large screwdriver as  well I'm calling that a moral victory for me wait he doesn't have one of he doesn't have one of the silicone the the membrane he you didn't  anything I won I won that's not even that's not even a question not even a question all right we're going to do another bonus round who would you like to challenge uh oh I mean I'm I'm just a part I'm just

screwdriver as yeah why don't we get him a full size screwdriver as well all right cool thank you so much Caleb  Caleb they're Shadow Boxing all right uh Dan you want to hit me with a merch message sure let's see what we got here when do you think uh when you think about tech knowledge do you feel it's more valuable to be an expert in one thing having the answers at hand or more of a generalist who knows where to look for expert answers the generalist and the experts are both valuable and you
answered the question for yourself because you said right there the generalist who knows where to look to for the answer who do you think you're going to get it from I am nothing without the expert I think I am a pretty solid generalist when it comes to Tech I know just enough about just about everything to be dangerous and I know who to ask and I know the right question to ask but I am nothing without the subject matter expert experts whether they work at the manufacturers or
whether they work at UH third party uh validation Labs like like portrait for example or whether they're in our audience shout out the ECC Squad the error check and correction Squad that looks at our videos early and will let us know hey I happen to have 18 years experience of this and if you change the wording this way it would be a little more correct like massive shout out to those guys um you know whether it's our internal experts we need both of those things in order to bring you guys the
content that we do and to hold ourselves to the standard that we want to reach and we still make mistakes we're still going to make mistakes we're going to be human forever that's never something that I can promise we will stop being but we need both of those pieces in order to do the very best that we can so no I can't I can't say one is more valuable than the other because that would just not be true all right what do we got next are we ready for our third Challenger we are ready it's Brandon all
right let's go the way I'm counting it I have a two in two record right now so this is for you be wrong but I mean you could feel like that I have a two and two record right now so this is for the win this is for the win for me we'll see about that I'm not going to go easy on you question for you guys do you guys happen to know the time no no no no no we got to do we got to do this we got to do the stown you got to do the fist you gotta do this oh yeah right right right I don't us lean in like
that all right let's go that Meme you know uh do you guys happen to know the time I just got described as it feels like I'm looking at a meat he's always Yip yapping isn't that crazy always Yip yapping I'm Yip yapping you're Yip yapping that is some s tier trash talk right there see we'll see how this goes he's the one trash talking let's see well I don't have an intro anymore but timing is key and this you'll be replacing a watch battery in this old cast digital watch how dare you call
this old this is classic vintage vintage all right retro step one you're going to use the Sim eject bit remove the strap by pushing out the pins that connect the strap to the watch face on both sides using a Phillips bit you'll unscrew all four screws on the back base that holds it together with Precision absolute Precision then you're going to remove the back of the watch and remove the Rubber seal around the housing using the Flathead bit you'll pry the battery and logic board from the housing and using
that same Flathead bait you're going to release all four tabs that hold the battery tray onto the logic board so we need to take out both straps yes sir they're going to remove the battery from the battery tray and replace the battery with a new one make sure the Panasonic logo is facing down so it's going to face down on the battery tray okay attach everything back together put the rubble Rubber seal back seal it up and if your watch power's on You've Won you don't ask for much do you L do
you how confident do you feel in replacing a watch battery I have done it before it's been a very very long time I generally don't work with things this small um I don't believe that I don't believe my wife would probably be good at this you know usually when I do this I have guide but uh you know we we'll do it blind okay all right all right we have no advantage in this one and the the way the sun has moved in the sky it's making the back of my legs hot my like my butt sweating now
uh I've got the Sun on the back of my legs which is not not helping my my palms are sweaty Dan switch to the butt a little the butt cam no butt cam that's extra per month these are heavy arms H sorry all right on go I'm ready three two 1 go all right Dan hit me with a merch message all right let's see what we got here closet guy again finally can use all the gift cards I saved up for a year why is virtual link discontinued the fact that I need to use an adapter for a standard connector on psvr2 is
suck um I think it basically came down to a total lack of adoption uh it's pretty cool that uh that USBC Port that you find on Nvidia 20 series uh gpus and then AMD included them on only their "highest end of 7,000 series I don't know" what was up with that um I love it but only for reasons that don't really matter oh my gosh I can't I can't get I can't get these pins out just skipping the straps honestly I respect it you know what it's a battery I'm going to get the battery out we'll
do that okay see what happens I got the scraps off um yeah so one of the things that man my hands are so sweaty I can't get the bit out dude that trash dog worked you're in his head man yeah no kidding he I live in a head Renford dude what was I even talking about right right right right right so one of the things that I think is really cool about it is it allows you to pass through a USB port to a VM alongside the GPU without worrying about any kind of conflicting um uh without worrying about any
resource conflicts which is applicable to almost nobody especially today now that antiche makes gaming in a VM basically a nightmare good Lord is he ever ahead why did you say I had to remove the rubber straat or the could have just ignored me so far it's working if you just ignored my instructions you could CH all the time anyway that is such that is such a hack you dirty okay so no that's you lus you claim that I have to remove the Rubber seal but I say I don't need to remove the Rubber seal
so let's try not removing the Rubber seal I'm also going to use a SIM tool instead of a flathead so she's getting off the rails okay uh let's see can I can we really call this repair well it's something oh dude you got to get these little okay no I do need the Flathead will have to change tools no I don't need the Flathead I can do it with the SIM removal okay I've got the back cover off mostly oh my goodness is this ever obnoxious brenon looks like he's running away with the lus all right hit me with
another merch message all right let's see what we got my hands are shaking the pressure's on for lonus and Luke do you think more phones should have gimmicks and Unique Designs like the phones of the 9s to O I.E folding covers rounded body sliding keyboards and screens I think most phones have screens honestly no um those ones were bad don't remember those ones were not nice to use they were mostly pretty terrible in fact we did a video recently looking at a bunch of those gimmick phones and kind of mostly
just laughing at them there were a couple that I was like oh yeah I missed that that would be awesome but for the most part no they were they were trash dude hey hey hey hey hey hey hey why is he getting why is he getting tips over there why is he getting hints no no no oh my God definitely bent some stuff uh on the way back in line has to do the straps though so well that's that's totally unfair I only have to do the straps because I followed the instructions listen you're on line of tech tips you
don't get an advantage here you know short circuit we're for the people oh my goodness dude I can't I bent these little tabs and I can't unbend them I have to take the whole thing back out oh no oh no oh man this is what you get for rushing I think that is the main takeaway here is that you should never hurry uh okay is that why you wanted me to take the rubber thing out oh dude you totally don't have to take that out that's not that's not an advantage at all you just have to slide it in the
right way which I totally didn't do oh man I am I am getting dunked on oh and it turns on Andy we have this year it does turn on you know what I'm not going to be the guy who doesn't finish the marathon just because just because the outcome of the race has already been determined I'm going to finish it I oh no a merch message he can do a merch message we got a prize for you as well a  TI that's what was on the line he did say he would just take the bragging rights we thought about not giving him
anything but we gave him the 380 what the heck heck LTT store.com guys woo oh my goodness oh that watch is mangled that watch is mangled dud watch watch it's going to work it's going to work did he into fix it for you no no no I'm going to I've got this I I have 100% got this you wouldn't even believe how much I've got this all my friends called they told me lonus you've got this I'll put these bits back doesn't have any friends oh boy all right Dan hit me with a merch message sure let's see what we
got uh hi my son just started college and is going to study software development and cyber security how was your time at college and what did you take from it steal or like learn I don't know I I didn't get the piece of paper but I did learn a lot it was still a valuable it was still a valuable experience and I wouldn't undo it there's there's lessons that I learned there's classes that I took that absolutely do help me in my in my current career however um I do think I might have gone
in with the wrong mentality I think I I went in with the goal of getting a degree and I think what I should have done was go in with the goal of getting an education um and so I think that um I think you know our generation was told get a degree get a degree get a degree ha and and I don't think that that was necessarily the right uh yeah I don't think that was necessarily the right mentality so um it was good it was valuable especially if you're getting into certain careers it is absolutely
necessary like I I got a lot of the benefit of a University degree without actually earning one because Ivon and I were able to afford a home with my income and with her creditworthiness because her degree meant that she was a pharmacist immediately out of school and um was able to earn a much better income than me at that time so there's no one right answer for everybody is what I would conclude all right I am putting this  finally no comment Dan hit me with another merch message sure let's see
what we've got hey lldd I mean it's just lus I don't know where Luke went will you be doing more newsletters the last main one I think was the minor screws they're nonfer screws yeah I already yelled at Seb about that it it doesn't stick to Titanium I was very upset okay all right sorry sorry sorry um will you be doing more newsletters the last main one I think was the minor backpack from earlier this year we are absolutely going to do more newsletters it's just something
that is hard to find the time to work on when we're so busy like making products and it's really like it's a really silly thing right because a lot of the the newsletter has such interesting parts of the story of the creation of the products that honestly you can't really fully understand it without that background and like it I don't know it's so it's so integral to uh to to understanding and uh and appreciating the work that the team has done but we're so busy making it that we just
kind of get tunnel vision sometimes so I think it's just a matter of us finding the time and I think I put this in the wrong way oh hamburgers hot dogs yeah I hate them um hate hot dogs come on man hot dogs no I don't hate hot dogs I hate it when I put it in the wrong thing in the wrong from the wrong side I couldn't tell that the holes were different sizes and I put it in the wrong way does this happen a lot to you lonus yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all but three times kind of just
starting to feel bad honestly jeez I can't I can't get I can't get the pin back in I can't I can't get the pin out I need Pliers are we working on LTT pliers no coming soon how about tall pliers come on go  out hit me with another merch message I got to stall for time yeah sure sure sure sure sure any plans to make more jigs up puzzles I like the CPU one and felt like Sarah could design some pretty good ones uh I don't think it's sold particularly well so I think that experiment is in the rearview mirror uh
I legitimately need pliers I cannot get this out um if you know where my backpack is I think Ivon has my backpack it has a pair of pliers in it why don't you do the other side because uh yeah I can do that all right so let's figure out which side is this they both look the same size how am I supposed to tell the difference all right I'm just going to hope for the best then I know there's an arrow on it I see the arrow but I can't tell if the arrow is the arrow to slide it in or the
arrow to slide it out it looks like The Arrow to slide it out I don't work on watches a lot okay okay that one was easy that one was effortless I wonder if whoever put this in before put it in wrong cuz I have such a hard time taking BL BL the person who did it before no no no no no no no that was so easy to put in you saw how hard it was for me to pop these out you know Chase is the one who practiced all this he's not here so I'm going to blame him blame Chase I like thate okay here
I'm going to try putting this in this side oh dude no I this is this is at least partially user error and at least partially my user error this went in so  now I just didn't know what the arrow meant if the arrow meant slide in that way or slide out that way it slide out that way didn't have any issue with it yeah you know what yeah cuz yeah watch where's his watch now all right GG here I'm going to do one of these all right enjoy he ate the watch oh yeah now the watch is somewhere yeah here you go all
right we have one more bonus round to end out the stream oh so I can still tie you could you could I can still have a tying record this is for all the ridge wallets we have left for all the LTX Ridge wallets all right here we go I'm going to close my eyes and pick someone  I think one of these bearings is a little better back there come on in what's her name I saw Aaron Aaron good luck uh did you switch the screwdrivers no interesting interesting CH did he switch to screwdrivers okay this is a fresh
screwdriver these are uh these are prototypes some of them don't actually have the best bearings one of them is not as good you should have taken the so you're already coming up with excuses out he that's interesting going do the live boxing right here okay it's number 49 nice nice just 20 away  number I rip a box you actually don't need any of that for this you don't need any of it you're just going to spin the top yeah we're just doing a Top Spin all right on go we'll see who can spin the
longest three two one go okay Dan hit me with a merch message sure uh love my full-side screwdriver have you considered making a tool kit to hold all the different tools you have made Allin one am I going to lose again yes we have um we haven't made anything like that yet we do have a bit holder coming that's really cool and magnetic uh but we don't have an all-in-one holder for everything there are some really cool 3D printed designs that you can find dud you're screwdriver how are you
losing just take your wallet take your wallet get out of here you can give some of these to three of favor people in the audience yes all right you have to give them away though you have to give them away put your they're not all for you Andy follow him make sure out take one it's hard isn't it it's a lot of pressure who looks the most  worthy all right thanks to all of our [Applause] contestants thanks everybody who showed up to the popup shop um thank you everybody out there for your support I
cannot believe how much love you guys are giving us for this product we have Nick came up to me a little while ago and told me we've already sold through over half of our inventory of it now so if you want to get your hands on one now is a really good time to do it did we ever take a close look at the at the actual like case and the bits and stuff so I I alluded to this before but um again can someone um toss me I fix it kit real quick oh perfect here's one so one of the differentiators for us is we
maximized the amount of depth for the skinny part of the shaft it's not a huge difference but it is a Difference Maker when you're trying to get into recessed plastic housings um that was something that uh we felt was really important for the design of our multibit we'd like to do a fixed Precision screwdriver set at some point in the future because sometimes you just need more depth and this is not no multi-bit solution is going to address that but we did want to make it as deep as we
could without compromising on the um like the the strength of it you know uh what else is there to kind of say about it oh we were we were really picky about the strength of the flat magnets that we used in here oh that's a particularly heavy bit um this is a what is this a T25 yeah so that's a Torx 25 so you can see we can go all the way upside down with bits in here not all flat magnets are made equal and in fact our first shipment of them our first supposedly production shipment whether it was the magnet
manufacturer playing games with our case assembler or whether it was them I don't know but they weren't strong enough and we caught that in QA so every unit that ships to a customer will have the fixed stronger magnets um we have a we have a nice magnetic mechanism on the uh the parts tray detach thing here it's stackable so if you want it to take up less space it's stackable and magnetic  there's always a lot of little things that we forget to talk about uh when we build a product uh it's it really is a
passion product for us and you guys can find it at LTT store.com it's got oh it's got our classic magnetic bit uh it's $29.99 us for the Precision screwdriver aluminum construction built-in bit storage um super strong magnet so we've also got a super strong magnet on here you can pick up even large screws or other bits so you don't have to worry about losing anything as long as it's feris uh super smooth action on the bearing what's up of the bit storage on the driver oh the bit storage oh yeah
absolutely yeah so if you have just like if you know realistically I'm only ever going to need like Phillips 1 Phillips Z and Philips zero for you know the work that I'm going to do I just want those on hand boom they're in there like that you pop them out they're ready to go you don't have to go kind of looking for their spot in here and none of these are unique features they're just features that we weren't really willing to compromise on cost for you don't have to put a hybrid
ceramic bearing in something you absolutely don't um but you can and you can still sell it for 30 bucks um how much is the the bit set uh 30 bucks the bit set is also 30 bucks so the whole kit is 60 bucks if you get both 50 then it's 50 so you get 10 bucks off okay cool that explains why the bit sets are selling way better than we anticipated um we thought we'd have about a 50% attach rate it's closer to 90% so I think we're going to Gap out on bit sets before we Gap out on screwdrivers which is um too
successful it's a good problem to have um I think we should probably do a few more merch messages before we completely tunee out here yeah that sounds like a good idea we've had nearly 400 oh neat yeah we are not going to get to all of them uh but we should "definitely do a few more we've done," 1400 orders uh pants ETA any other new products coming like sandals or socks oh pants coming very soon I think uh yeah already would know yeah dude you work for the CW team now so he he has been
one of the driving forces along with Maria our thumbnail artist ironically but she's also she she's got a passion for photography um these two and am I leaving out someone really important here uh Gary and Sarah help out a lot with that as well but these guys have been really pushing our merchandising forward on the site making sure that our photos are like really fun and really engaging that everyone has fun making them that they do a better job of of okay I'm going to say selling the
product but that's that's like a dirty word but of communicating like the bloody work that we put into these things um so so Ry because he's working on merchandising is probably going to know when are the cargo pants launching they're going to be later in September so okay so this month y exactly okay uhhuh I have already done my photo shoot for it so inventory is here it's just a matter of figuring out the right timing giving these guys enough time to make sure that they you know build the right
story around them they're a really great product um I bet I bet there's people wearing them I bet Tan's wearing them tinan wears them I don't think ever Tak every day for the last year they're really handy they got so many different Pockets compartments things you can put stuff on really really good it's really important to us to have people like tinan who will religiously wear this stuff and try to destroy it before we ever send it to you we found quality issues in what we thought was the final
product that we had to go back and rework that would have been not disastrous cuz most people wouldn't have ever encountered them but wouldn't have been good enough for us um is what I'll say okay what else we got Dan uh Hey dll bit storage for fullsize screwdriver bits when um oh tinan oh yeah he is wearing the pants show me your pants I love it how many wees do you think these have for you now probably like 5 or 600 nice days nice yeah so we've this has been in development for a really
really long time and this is this is what they look like patina they're not going to stay looking like they do out of the box forever they fade actually they fade a lot but when we discovered that I and actually a lot of the other members of the team who wear them religiously uh Andy's super into them Andrew loves them we were like yeah but like it's a feature they look cool so we decided not to change anything about the dieser materials cuz we were really happy with the way that
they faded out so take that for what it is we could have changed it we decided not to it wasn't a cost-saving measure um question for you though um that magnetic bit holder for the fulls sizee screwdriver that like sticks onto the wall is that coming yeah yeah we're working on it there's we have our first t0 samples off the molds we have a couple of modifications we need to make but yeah what's definely on the path the silicone holds it too well okay and we missed one feature in
the cad model that we have to add back okay all right cool so you'll have it when it's ready basically yeah all right what else you got for me Dan conveniently the whole team is here so I don't have to make up answers to anything like seriously there's so many members in the team here today we got HR we got business we got business development we got head of uh head of Creator Warehouse uh we've got uh Community Management we've got uh man I'm there's probably going to be a
question for so that's taana she does a lot of our like um materials and um how would you like Material Science essentially like raw materials development and like validation essentially she's been invaluable which unintuitively in English means valuable um dude yeah we've got everyone we've got the engineering team here we've got uh accounting here we've got uh product design for like the fashion team sorry we got to answer more questions yeah we got 400 mer matches that's not really a
question uh and speaking of Dan question uhoh yeah we know all the people that are around us do you have a question for any of them or for lonus no I just read the merch messages I don't write them why don't you read one okay this is weird coming from not Linus hi from Bangalore India first-time caller longtime fan we see devices moving away from traditional repairability features like externally accessible screws will LTT Labs cover repair ability I think that in the very
long term that's something we'd love to do but as part of our and we may make an entire video about sort of the realignment that Luke has been working on for labs uh I think we're going to go we're going to promise nothing and deliver what we can deliver that is up to our expectations um so at some point that's something that's really near and dear for us but we're not going to tackle it until we're ready to tackle it in a way that is scalable um and so we've got we've got a
lot of we've got a lot to keep building is what I'll say dll I used to travel for business all the time and have changed jobs since I married I was teaching the new kid who is on the road a bunch of travel hacks do you have any particular favorites oh I mean I don't know if I'm going to have anything particularly insightful but like never check a bag that's one of the reasons the LTT backpack is what it is so I can go away for 2 to 3 days and not check a bag I can basically just take that and that's
that's it um man I I I love having a designated pocket for everything like my passport only goes in the one pass in the one pocket where my passport goes uh that has reduced my anxiety by so much counting Counting is key don't try to remember okay I've got my steam deck I've got my backpack I've got my roller bag remember three I have three things you will save yourself so many left behind items that way um man dude I've got a uh I have a list that I do for travel so it's got all of
my like things that I should bring laptop laptop charger you know drugs glasses earplugs that sort of thing and then I just keep that saved on a Google sheet and then when I'm going to travel I just kind of copy and paste that and I have a list of stuff I'm taking and then when I'm packing up to leave I just look at that list again perfect yeah oh here's one that might gross you out you don't have to buy a new travel siiz toothpaste if you just take your full-size toothpaste when it's empty and 
it this man's Frugal I love it respect I don't want any more hack next question yeah longtime viewer love the channel lonus if you had to work in it exclusively what would you specialize in um I like troubleshooting yeah hell yeah yeah I like uh respect I I like figuring out what's wrong with something and kind of following the failure path back to back to the source and figuring out okay can we Salvage this or is it a write off um I mean that's that's where the channel started at the end of the day
love the content sorry love the content would you consider a video on accessible Tech or software it's chronically under reported by Tech media we've done a little bit in the past we covered the Xbox um accessible controller back when they launched it we've looked at some accessible keyboards and stuff like that I think the biggest challenge for me is  to it's a balancing act on the one hand we want to draw attention to it but on the other hand we don't want to substitute the voice of the people who
depend on this stuff every day for our own voice um so there's definitely ways that we could tackle that you know elevating existing voices being in Vancouver it's not always the easiest to do collabs like I don't know if you've noticed the the percentage of collabs that creators based in places like LA or New York do it's because the people they want to collaborate with are 18 blocks away uh we pretty much have to involve a plane ticket anytime we collab with someone who isn't electroboom you know um
there's like there's almost nobody here so it it does add a lot of cost and it adds a lot of complexity to it so it's something that I would like to do more of but it's something that is has a lot of challenges that you might not necessarily immediately recognize do you believe fewer people are keeping up with the latest PC Hardware in these last Generations or was it the previous generation of the future Generations 980 past 1080 nowish 5080 6080 future I think that people are getting a little
disenfranchised by the cost of of computer hardware I think that part of that is Justified especially when you look at individual components "incremental increases over the 3,000 or" "4,000 but I also think that part of that" is sort of um is sort of not looking back at the history of how much computers cost like I picked up a London Drugs flyer from 1997 or something like that and I'm sitting there going wow in 1990s dollar yeah a a basic computer with Monitor and speakers and keyboard and mouse was like
"$5,000 " 1990s y you can totally still buy a banging gaming machine and monitoring "keyboard and mouse for $5,000 everything" is always the same price right and so it sometimes I think we are we are righteously angry and other or rightfully angry and other times I think that we forget where we came from and how Out Of Reach computer computers were for people back then by last year's stuff yeah and and we also I think have an obsession in our society with buying things new instead of repairing them and
making the most out of them and that's something that that that's a big part of the reason that we even started scrapyard Wars was to really draw attention to the value that you can get out of 300 bucks or 500 bucks or the most recent uh the most recent one 800 Canadian dollar 700 Canadian 100 US  about about $600 of like 500 in change it's not a lot of money and we got a lot of value we got a good gaming tower a gaming monitor keyboard mouse desk chair speakers mic the whole thing it can be
affordable um you've just got to be willing to put in the time you got to you got to find some passion for it so we're certainly we feel doing our best to build that passion and build that interest but we need some help from the manufacturers to give us exciting stuff to talk about Hi l us looking forward to the screwdriver I work at a very big company and feel a bit stuck in terms of professional growth what advice do you have about growing at a big company it's tough no matter what I say
it'll be wrong depending on what company that you work at you know sometimes the key is make your boss look good you know get them the promotion they'll take you with them uh sometimes the key is go around uh you know cut through the obstructionist red tape and get stuff done in other companies it's be a team player and and play 100% by the rules in other companies it's it doesn't matter what you do you'll never be recognized give up um I would say that one of the most powerful conversations you can have in
terms of career advancement though is here's my offer from someone else are you prepared to match it that work just about anywhere and they might tell you to walk but hey you've already got another offer right yeah I'm a technical lead at Big tech company I love my job but I'm really struggling to excite my team to do awesome stuff any tips on motivating my  Excellence oh man look I am not an expert when it comes to like you know management books and and team leadership
books or whatever else the only way that I really know how to lead is to be infectious um be enthusiastic um celebrate like way over the top celebrate when someone does something really great uh positive reinforcement is the way forward and that's not to say that you never have to have tough conversations when something's not up to standard but um be encouraging and celebrate the stuff that you really want to see and and hopefully over you'll see more of it sometimes there's a corporate culture that seeps
Beyond uh can seep into your team that there's nothing you can really do about but do your best with it have fun fun is fun is infectious people want to have fun uh I want a good e in pixel to exist do you think it's possible with future Tech uh not not in with future Tech yeah maybe we could have like a reflective display of some sort that has the advantages of in but just you should you should watch our video on the color e in monitor because it really highlights why good e in cannot
be a thing it they're particles right they're they're they're colored particles that have to physically move to the surface of the display so they have inertia like you can't move them  I I don't see a path to like gaming on E in in its current state what is your favorite meal your wife makes you for dinner oh uh ooh I don't know about dinner but she makes a mean crepe ooh blueberry progis oh that sounds nice they're kind of like blueberry pie but not sweet get a little
bit of salt on there get that butter get those blueberries really nice fry fry them up salt and savory goes well together yeah not just like a bowl of cereal uh well my don't mean might need my wife to cook me that yeah I mean I think I can prepare that on my own Al better I do have a thing yeah I do have a thing where everything tastes better if she makes it I don't know what it is it's just there's love in it it's made with love Yeah trademark scrolling across your shop somehow a lot of items
I wanted were sold out what's your long-term plan on the store more products more stock or keep it Niche also plans on getting back on the motorbike we do need to improve our replenishment processes that's something yeah that no that's something that the team is aware of and is working on part of the reason that the mix is a little random right now is because we did a lot of Linus Le development and we want to really narrow our our focus our development Focus onto the things that
really mean a lot to you guys we're doing some like third- party independently validated surveying right now it's costing a lot of money but hopefully it's going to give us some valuable insight and I think you're going to continue to see Niche eclectic things that we just made because we thought they were really cool but I think you're also going to see a little bit more guidance from what sells like I didn't anticipate that our everyday wear like our 24/7 line was going to move the
way that it did but a lot of you just want something that's good quality with subtle branding um but that you know for the people who know they know that it's LTT uh so things like just our basic um like collared shirts sell incredibly well so we want to provide more of that for you guys who need that for your everyday workware you just want something that has the trust me bro guarantee that you know it's going to be good quality and you don't want to leave your couch I get it I see you uh oh and
and the motorbike I will definitely be back on it next summer all right I got about five more here do you use an intercom or headphones while riding or do you go noo headphones at all uh I have headphones wired into my helmet like like like flat um like those uh what's that brand of like cheap ass cost I have I have some cost um like flat speakers that I just like double-sided taped into my uh helmet I don't know what our neighbors are doing but it's exciting they're banging uh what what superpower would
you like to have the   what would I like to have the most can I pick a suite of superpowers like can I  sure see Superman seems pretty goated yeah but living forever would suck if you couldn't Grant immortality to people you like you know yeah yeah that's like the whole negative of so like I I wouldn't want live forever if I can't also live forever  homies Spider-Man's pretty friendly neighborhood you know that's pretty cool one extra arm you can't say you want invisibility without seeming like a
weirdo yeah that's the creepy one do yeah that's definitely the creepy one about time freeze you could like procrastinate you could have a nap oh I like naps time freeze okay okay end of season one of Rick and Morty where you can freeze time selectively for you and anyone that you want to freeze with you that sounds cool let's go with that let's go with that uh tall sizing when we have tall sizing of some products like some of our pants are available in standard and tall as for
the t-shirts guys I am internally believe it or not the strongest advocate for them we're working on them I think our next restock is going to have tall sizes very exciting very exciting last couple is the Retro monitor lamp still in works uh would love to buy one someday congrats on the awesome products sorry about the train yeah I think there's some certification stuff it may end up being North America only because it was going to cost like8 Grand to certify it for the rest of the world and
I don't think we're going to sell that many of them so it would drive up the cost of it very significantly but it's coming okay last one I got for you here I have a pre-teen now what kind of career advice do you give your own son how hard do you push academics after school that sort of thing we push extracurriculars pretty hard we want them to be rounded we don't push academics super hard cuz we don't really know how to they don't really have grades anymore so like we tell we
always tell our kids I don't I don't care what the outcome is as long as you try your absolute best sometimes that lands sometimes it doesn't as for career um I don't even know what the point of talking to a 12-year-old 13-year-old about career is I didn't have any idea back then and even if I did have some idea I ended up doing something completely different anyway I kind of want them to find their path and the good news is they're in a privileged enough position that they
have time to figure that out I don't want them to take forever and just like you know fail to launch but um they've got time I'm not too worried about it yet all right that's it that's it all right well hey thank you guys so much for tuning into the screwdriver popup uh thanks to those of you who picked up our new Precision multi-bit screwdriver uh shout out all the creators who are going to be getting some of these uh special Creator Edition ones and special colors over the next little bit and
