if you can only have one computer to do all of your stuff every single task that you need it would probably be this one the Asus G14 before we look at the laptop let's have a little look at the charger for Power we've got a 180 W power adapter that is delivered through the Asus slim powerjack TM this right here is kind of like USB type-c but you can't plug USB type-c stuff into it that would be a bad time and it also delivers way more current which allows us to actually have higher efficiency through it so
here is the brand new 2024 Asus G14 now you will see that we are missing the animatrix on the back which is a little bit sad cuz I really like putting a line of sad face just on the back of my laptop but at the same time how much I'm actually going to miss it is almost zero the io that we get is really quite good given the size of this thing so on the right hand side we have an SD card reader just a small one fulls sizee USB type A and A type c that does 10 gbit and display port left hand side we have
headphone microphone combo Jack another USB type A A type c fulls sizee HDMI 2.1 and our little Asus slim powerjack TM seems pretty light pretty light for a 4070 at least what do you think this seems riged around 3.7 lb maybe o no 3.3 it is actually lighter than I expected which is quite good oh we have the full aluminum body for this year it's all CNC machine and I have to say it looks absolutely fantastic this right here is like MacBook levels of quality this might be close to exceeding a Macbook quality
let's see 14-in MacBook 14-in Asus oh that's pretty darn close the Asus might even have the edge which is shocking before I turn this on I've heard that these will speak to you a little bit when they start up let's see wow that sounded just like a segue to this sponsor thanks to Zen market for sponsoring this video buying from overseas can be Troublesome and expensive but Zen Market helps by consolidating your orders for free and sending them out in as few shipments as

right let's have a gander at how powerful this thing is so for the processor we have an AMD ryzen 9 8945 HS which has AI in it it's apparently the "same as 7,000 but with some AI bolted on" and really that's probably going to be really good for you in the future I feel like these sort of AI accelerators will not be super useful for a couple years but will be the sort of thing where in 5 or 10 years it might be the difference between this laptop running kind of well and just being awful for memory we have
32 GB of ddr5 6400 megat transfer per second stuff in here a wd 1 TB SSD a mediatech WiFi 6E chip can I get a boo Bo thank you I really do not like mediatech I've had so many issues where I'm using an AMD laptop that has a mediate Tech Wi-Fi card in it and whenever I go between access points it's really bad for dropping out or just generally not being reliable I much prefer the Intel ones and if you can swap one of those into here I would highly highly recommend it but we also
have that's very controversial is the Nvidia RTX 470 that's controversial because last year's model had up to a 4090 and now a 4070 is as high as you can go in this and I personally think that's totally fine I have have seen some people complaining online but this is so much thinner and just generally more portable than last year's version that I think the tradeoff is quite good especially since you're not getting the performance of a 490 in this this cannot properly cool a 490 like you can physically put
it in here but why it's just going to be loud it's not going to be all of the 49s performance and I really like what Asus has done here and just made the laptop smaller and put the GPU that people actually buy yeah or get mad at me down below maybe you want the 490 by last year's and finally there's an AMD radon 780m that is just the integrated graphics and it allows us to do you know normal integrated Graphics stuff I'm guessing no touchscreen yeah no touchcreen but oh well this is an incredible panel
especially for a laptop of this size so it is OLED love to see that 2880 by 1800 so that's sort of like your 1440p but stretch related vertically so you have that 16 by10 which is just awesome because you can see so much extra content when you're doing like web browsing working on videos photos words any of those now for the display you're going to want to configure your settings because it does really change how well this panel is delivering the photons to your eyeballs so when the Armory crate
here we go over to game visual now the color gamut native right here is a vivid profile and that is going to just sear your eyeballs with the most Vivid of vivid colors now a lot of people do like that but if you want to do photo editing or just generally look at things how they were intended it has an average Delta e of 4.4 which is just not very good the good news is though if we come in here go from native to just srgb and apply that we now have a display that isn't quite as vibrant but it is able to
deliver those visuals to you with an average Delta e of 0.9 which is absolutely fantastic we expect below two for professional color work so this rate here you can be doing professional color work and I don't know uploading your bestest pictures to Instagram that you've ever done now one thing that is unfortunate is that for whatever reason this laptop got really mad at the software that we use to check the color accuracy of displays when it was in HDR so we were able to verify that it has a
brightness of 6 100 nits in HDR which is very impressive but we weren't able to verify if it is color accurate in HDR that said though it looks really good in HDR we can tell you that much and given its SDR performance we do imagine it is very very good we just cannot verify that with anything other than our eyeballs last thing to talk about Hardware wise is the keyboard and the trackpad and they are excellent I would give it a very solid a like if we look right here keycap stability is excellent
I can push push on the corner and get a tiny bit of deflection but if I really press on it the whole key is going to actuate long before the corner of this key gets below the chassis also the consistency from key to key fantastic also below the keyboard we have this trackpad and it is excellent it's nice and large really as big as they could get in here that was a very large Source bot on the previous G4S you were kind of giving up a good trackpad for having like a 49 or whatever the heck now of
course this is a gaming laptop so I want to make sure that you guys get a really good idea of how this works in the games that you are definitely going to play starting and probably ending with crab Champions so guess we've discovered one problem here uh 2880 by 1800 is pretty strange normally if you have more of like a 1440p you would go for 2560 x600 so this is a little bit larger and this game does not support it lots of games probably don't support it really if they
just have a settings menu so that might be annoying at times that still looks pretty darn good though first thing I'm noticing this Ola display looks fantastic so we seem to be getting a pretty solid 110 to 130 FPS okay the smoothness of this display is incredible and that's aided a lot by the fact that this has gsync now in our LT video we go into this in more depth but basically this panel is refreshing or more so updating 960 times every single second that allows you to get
around the problems of changing how long each pixel is on for it's always on 960 times per second and how many times you display each frame is how you get that gsync variable refresh rate instead of trying to like make each individual frame last a different amount of time besides crab game we try this out in a couple different games against Lenovo Legion slim 7i that has an I9 a 4070 and 32 GB of RAM so it's pretty comparable to this although it is larger so you would expect it to be a little bit
better and it was I would say something like 10% faster or so which is very impressive for the G14 given that it is significantly smaller and nearly as powerful so good job there Asus okay how are the speakers in this that sounds very clear oh oh when Asus was here they said this might be the best sounding 14-in laptop and they might be right all right let's compare it to the  wow it's way better than the HP dragonfly MacBook very few laptops get to the MacBook stage of this test all 
G14 oh that's really close   oh I think we can call that a tie the MacBook has a little bit more on the high end but I think that's more so just the target curve that they're going for you could probably get a little bit more trouble on this if you wanted to but they're both loud they're both clear excellent jaw suus on this and finally let's have a look at the webcam this thing is 1080p you guys remember when they used to not even have webcams on this thing that was stupid I'm glad they
changed that and this one's really really good look at that up here we also have Windows hello facial recognition so you can get into it just using your face even that is getting a little bit confused but like fair enough there's big bright lights right here and you can even see Andy 11 T6 screws later some of which are different lengths so be careful we can get in side first thing in here we have a 73w battery and our testing it was able to get us a very impressive nearly 10 hours which for a gaming laptop
particularly one with a 4070 is incredibly impressive that's how you're able to have a laptop like this where I was saying if you can only have one computer buy this one that's what this has that stands out against the competition like that slim 7 that we're were talking before that slim 7 got 4 hours and 45 minutes now if you do want to fully load this thing up with combuster for some reason on battery it does only get you an hour but at the same time just don't do that please here
we can see our Wi-Fi card is replaceable which is excellent cuz you'll want to do that and we have our SSD over here one thing that's very very sad though is that you cannot upgrade the RAM it is all soldered down on the old version you had one sodm slot that you were able to swap in and out this one nothing couple more fun things to look at in here we have three fans they've got the little one in the middle which is apparently great for your vrms and just keeping your temperatures down on the keyboard
actually one thing that I didn't talk about before but is very nice is that these do have a little bit to ventilation right through WD so your hands don't get too hot while you're gaming now this cooler compared to some of the others that we have seen is not the most impressive but they are able to overcome some of that by just simply using liquid metal on this and of course finally the price this model that we have right here with 32 GB of RAM terabyte of storage and the 470 will cost you
"$2,000 us now if you do want to spend a" little bit less you can get a 4060 16 GB "of RAM and a 1 tab SSD for $1,600 us" which is pretty good and it's also pretty darn close to the omen transcend 14 which we're going to be looking at very very soon it's on my desk right now hit like get subscribe see you later
