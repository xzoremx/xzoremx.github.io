a this is a printer I've been looking forward to since I saw it the first time it's a pre-production micronic SLS printer unlike most of the other printers we've looked at this is a laser printer that can print out of nylon and get you almost production ready parts that was awesome this thing should be able to do production ready Parts without any support and with almost any geometry you could think of which is amazing in box number two we have the bill ch ber which holds all of your raw powder and
eventually your completed Parts unlike  this for this type of printer you need a full build chamber and we'll get into  on next up we have the powder processing unit this particular one unfortunately got damaged during shifing but they were able to send us a replacement right away looking inside it we have a Sie for recycling your powder a filter and extractor a bunch of processing tools a mask and some gloves power adapter and the powder itself oh looks like they included a couple of uh test Parts
too looks like we were sent a couple of extra care packages as well some more test prints ah they made a little H version of the stubby good and this last part that we have to open up is a glass pane to go on top of the build chamber we've gotten everything opened up but now we have to go through the first setup steps for the printer and all of its components I was wrong there's more to unpack inside the printer itself part removal scooper and some H  we've gotten through the first bit of   
goes powder needs to get smacked around a   goes now that the printer set up and ready to go let's take a look at the other part of this that I'm quite intrigued by the slicer it's based on Unreal Engine which unlike most other slicers means you can just throw Parts in have them drop into the build volume and it'll just self- pack for you which anyone who's had to pack a build plate knows that's a massive quality of life improvement with the other SLS system we have when we're putting Parts into the
slicer we have to place them all essentially manually if we want to get them close together it slicer doesn't handle things very well ah so you can see how it's running through each layer that it's going to print though I can't tell if it'll show me what the whole part looks like just from the print file itself so that might be a surprise for all of us later let's actually get printing so insert this in print from SD Linus demo 2 hours and 20 minutes it's going to heat up for probably about
15 minutes and then it'll start actually going through the process of printing with all of the SLS printers of this style they take a very fine powder spread it across the print bed in a very small layer heat it up and then hit it with a laser to turn it into a liquid in a very small area and Center it together after that spreads another layer of powder across and does it again what that means is you can have any part geometry you want without any support and having to worry about it cuz the
uncentered material is your support and you can recover most of it after the fact our print finished up overnight before we take a look at it let's hear this message from our sponsor thanks to motion gray for sponsoring this video their sit to stand desk come in a wide variety of models and sizes with easy to follow instructions and all the tools you need for assembly included right in the Box check with the Ergo 2 Series some of the most affordable desks of this type on the market with a two
segment frame and a quiet but Power powerful single motor it has a height adjustment range of 28 to 46 in and supports up to 176 lb of weight that's about 80 kg for you metric lovers so pick up your own motion gray using our Link in the description and get 10% off  Linus now we got it out of the printer we're getting the top glass off placing our filter back on using our transfer tool which is a nice little scoop pretty cleverly designed place that down here now we're going to
transfer this into our sifting tool which looking inside it's a little seeve that'll recycle a lot of the used powder and should hold all of our parts above   bricks but they didn't break apart too well going to break these down by hand a little bit  shake you can potentially break the parts if they're really fragile but from what I saw these ones should be pretty robust I got most of the bulk powder off and since we do have a sand blaster I'm going to take these over and clean them up over there looks
like we have parts of a lightsaber a little Deadpool ninja that's cute and then some more keychains with the micronics logo and little uh scales on the back the parts look pretty much comparable to the other SLS printers that I've seen in the past break one just to see yep there you go so yeah they're definitely Mighty strong as I would expect they're essentially solid nylon though more brittle because of the nature of how they're made but certainly a capable printer now that
we've seen the printer all of its parts and what it can do let's talk about micronics itself normally we don't cover kickstarters on short circuit but for this one we made a bit of an exception because myself and a bunch of other people on the team were really excited about the technology and the potential options that it could lend to creators or other people due to its price point and its form factor compared to competing products the planned launch for the kickstarter is June 13th and
they've said they expect things to ship in April 2025 but as with all kickstarters it's never a guarantee so your mileage may vary for another system that's similar to this capability you're looking at about "$17,000 at a starting point and this one" is going to run you "$4,500 retail price the kickstarter" "price is somewhere between 3,000 and" about 3700 and the overall form factor of this is movable by one person whereas if you compare that to the fuse 1 plus that we have that's at minimum a
two-person move with a lot of infrastructure around you so the portability and ease of use of this potentially makes it accessible to individual makers or small companies for the overall specs of the machine they expect it to be able to hold about1 mm tolerances for the individual Parts the total build volume is about 160x 160x 200 mm which is a little bit smaller than some of the other competitors but still a pretty good build volume especially for a printer of this size
which is about 3 10x 330x 700 mm again pretty movable by one person having this printer and using it has made me more excited about it than less thanks for watching this short circuit if you liked it and want to see more check out our prusa markv video
