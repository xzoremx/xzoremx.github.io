what's better than this pink keyboard combo from Ghost featuring by the time we finally got our pink belfine keyboard combo from Ghost the new one came out blue and improved bathat with a one in five chance of getting an actual bathwater key cap let's open it here we go oh my God we've got our mouse pad I've seen these for years they've been a big part of the Gaming Community for quite a long time it's not always a butt on the end sometimes it's something completely different I'll let you take a guess as
to what it could be we've also got oh is this the bathwater key cab you got to wait and we get an accessories box with key cap switch pullar type-c USB cable and screwdriver oh it's nice that it comes with a screwdriver we got some extra screws for the keyboard that's always a really nice inclusion and then cable I'm a little unimpressed it's not sleeved uh our pink one actually does come with like a coiled sleeved cable and it's a lot nicer than this this has a ferai bead and it's about 5 ft long so
it's fine uh a little disappointed but whatever we'll see what else we got we've got our nice blue keyboard from Ghost I already don't like the sound of it but you know what we'll take a closer look at this in a second but I got to unbox the rest of our sweet sweet peripherals here you can like see deformity oh you can see through the key caps wow that's cheap looks like it's just d sub cuz everything's just printed onto the keyboard so your Legends are actually going to wear out faster than
if they were double shot uh but we'll try we'll try we'll look we'll look more of that later I got to look at everything else like stickers wow these are actually pretty decent stickers they got a bit too much white outline but uh otherwise you know they're okay they're good size stickers can be expensive especially when you're ordering a lot of them so getting six included is not too bad we've got a nice little B deline holographic shiny welcome to the Ghost Family warranty
okay and keyboard shortcuts it's nice it's a good collab no matter what this product might turn out to be whether the quality of certain items is good or bad I will say it is a cool piece of like collector kind of History so take that for what you will then it's also got a wrist rest that I actually really like it's nice and heavy feels like it's memory foam this is what I'm really after is this floppy wrist rest I uh I'm a big fan of nice memory foam wrist rests and this is a good size it's a
good color nice and comfy we'll try it later but yeah I'm digging it so far and then we've got our Mouse which is just an M1 ultral light it's got a nice sensor in it it's very light one thing you may have noticed is that it's wired not wireless so keep that in mind as for the briefcase itself um I really do like it it's solid the foam fits everything pretty well nothing really falls out unless you're smacking it around I really love the blue and the pink I think they play very nicely together wow
look at that number 488 of a th000 we're special around here we're quirky before we dive into our bathwater maybe keycap we got to try out the keyboard it is a K75 from Ghost um it's fine it's a plastic keyboard with a really Hollow sound to it especially on the space bar uh the nice thing is that it's clear so you can actually see the back of the board I've got one uh Portico 75 at home that looks kind of similar to this and I had a similar problem where it felt really Hollow uh was not great so what I'd
recommend if you look if you are the kind of person who buys this kit and that can be to ever but if you are you really want to open this thing up add some foam or tape at least because you  this it's not great it's not the worst thing I've ever tried but it's really not great they're just linear switches it is hot swappable five pin hot Swap and a pretty good form factor I'm actually a big fan of this kind of like 75% where you get your frro um it's still short you don't have a uh 10 keys
or anything like that oh I love the Bell the Bell key cap up in the top left there that's great and then the octopus the octopus on here you can just take your own guess as to what that might be I will say Bel deline is a popular e girl who has kind of uh Gone the anime approach I'm going to go with anime instead of H there and um octopuses and tentacles tend to be something that you find in anime and I'll leave it at that we've also got this little like milk jar with some milk splashing
out and the cavar headphones which yeah she's very famous for wearing cater headphones and then her in the bath uh the bath key cap is probably my favorite maybe as much as I'd like the bathwater key cap although these bubbles are great um overall the color scheme is great if you like a kind of pastel teal and light pink and a weird blue um it's very pretty easily the biggest issue that I have is the lack of a nice cable you've just got this really Bland white USBC cable um really should have been sleeved
or maybe even coiled uh the white is fine white matches the key caps and everything else I'll say the wrist rest is comfortable um as much as I might never own one of these they're always very comfy because they basically follow just a regular dress design except the very boldest before I actually finish plugging this in let's exchange this key cap here with the bathwater one if it truly there's liquid in there oh my God Is that real verified gamer girl bath water from Bel deline herself if you
don't know uh she's famous for selling her bath water and it's sold out guys are thirsty I guess those simps be simpon one issue I have as cool as this is and I love that it's actually got liquid in it if if if you get a normal one by the way it'll just be maybe empty or solid fill we're not sure but it won't have a liquid in here um one huge issue I have though is that it looks like they've just stickered on this HP space bar bandage oh it's a health bar yeah they've just stickered that on and
that just seems um kind of lazy and then this top cap can I remove it it feels okay it feels pretty glued on nope you can take it off I don't think it's supposed to come off I Can Feel Like  it smells like nothing I don't know what to tell you drink it drink it drink it  girl it says don't drink it on the web drink it drink it drink it oh it is just a thimble you know you can drink like a thimble of bleach and you won't get sick yeah it's got a weird taste to it I'm not swallowing that
okay I can't believe I just did that yeah they say don't drink it I'm pretty sure there's chemicals in there oh I've got like this lingering taste in my mouth that sucks the reality of what I just did is like washing over me in a terrible terrible way as for the key cap itself it sits here nicely it's a oneu key cap they're they're saying it's Universal on the website I mean honestly any oneu is going to fit on any one U so yeah technically it's Universal but they're not really doing you any kind of big
favors by that okay now that I've actually debased myself to this degree let's plug this in and uh try typing on it to see if it's any good but before we try it we're going to talk about a word from our sponsor manscaped thanks to manscape for sponsoring this video if you're feeling a little overgrown and you've got a hot date coming up with belfine trim your Hedges the manly way with manscapes lawnmower 5.0 Ultra its trimmer and foil blades are interchangeable letting you choose from
buzzcut bald or Jeff Bezos bald and to navigate through those more volumous spots the lawnmower 5.0 Ultra even comes with an LED light so you can see right through the Shrubbery it's also portable and charges conveniently with a USBC cable meaning you can whack the weeds anywhere you might be check out the lawnmower 5.0 ultr manscape.com circuit and use code circuit for 20% off in free shipping I like all the RGB it could be diffused a bit better so that it's not just like a bunch of LEDs shining at you
like the mouse here um whatever it's  itself it's Hol it's going to do what it  works 123 98% that's not too bad uh the mouse is okay it's got a good sensor in it I think that this shape in general is comfortable for me but I'm also not a big fan of the speed holes cuz I can feel them constantly but you're also not going to get as light as it is without those taking away a bunch of material from the mouse so to each their own I'm not crazy buzy about it but it's perfectly fine I wish that all of this
was Wireless as someone who typically likes wired Tech I just I don't know the cable for the mouse feels bad the cable for the keyboard feels bad if you're going to make him wired dedicated just add a nice cable please this feels really weird also with her like looking back at me uh there's not a lot that makes me uncomfortable and I wouldn't even say I'm uncomfortable right now but it's just I guess if you ever want a little bit of reassurance you just kind of move your mouth so you're like yeah
I'm having a real bad day a thanks Belle as for the keyboard itself I mean it's a pretty typical ghost keyboard K75 uh it's fine it's kind of too expensive for what it is considering it's all plastic I think that you can get something better out there for similar prices even when this is on sale normally the keyboard is like 180 bucks which is way too much for what it is it's often probably at the real price you know where you see sales and it just sticks around forever it's it's on sale
for 120 which is better but still not great astr laabs they're not bad it's a pixart 3389 sensor in here so it's very accurate and precise the only problem is it's got latency uh quite a bit at around 14 or 15 milliseconds which is I mean it's not like a ton but it's definitely a lot more than uh what you get out of something better like a Logitech especially for a Wired Mouse like what the hell the latency should be basically zero but here we are as for the keyboard Windows does not like the
ghost software and it doesn't have via compatibility so uh you're kind of stuck with it unfortunately uh otherwise in terms of of latency it tested a little slower on the side of gaming keyboards so it's fine I don't like it I think it's just overpriced realistically I probably wouldn't buy it myself but I do love the color scheme like that's what keeps drawing me in I got to say this whole combo it's pretty cute overall but what does it look like as part of the cutest setup 
this looks amazing when it's in its natural habitat but I got David here and  thinks why does it sound so bad it's terrible what is like is it Hollow yeah it's pretty Hollow flip it over look at how much empty space is on the bottom oh that's a shame it can be fixed you can make it better but yeah it's expensive I love the translucent look and I like that these match although because this is more match it feels like it's actually pretty different right I don't even want to touch this what come on I'm
good no how about the bathwater geek cap what's bath water about them no just the one key cap on the top left oh there was water in there oh did you drink it yeah good overall this keyboard feels really cheap how expensive is it it's 180 full price usually on sale for 120 okay even one no even 120 is too and that's just the keyboard doesn't include rist rest anything just the keyboard yeah yeah I don't think I would be spending my $120 on this next up is Mark our senior editor wow one of our
senior editors this is a really cute setup that's great what do you think about the peripherals they are very not cute what you don't think they're cute yeah I mean there are oh wait hold on I know that person yeah I mean I don't know her would you would you buy this this full bath water combo oh definitely not next UPS James Scott from the business team oh great James using my real name you have a stage name uh Bobby G Bobby G Bel Delphine fan number five oh this actually is Bel deline yeah okay
guess a price guess a price how much would you before I guess the Price Is that real bath water it was is that going to be available at the Christmas party maybe I would probably guess around 150 for everything but that makes me guess probably double that 250 bucks for the whole thing with the one in five chance NOP nope it's just plastic yeah it is that is so no all right no thank you thank you next up is Belle not deline please blur me I don't want my girlfriend to know uh but this is
beautiful I would definitely buy this no matter the price no matter the price no what I just want to drink that bath water I've been a big fan for years a loyal subscriber did you notice that these are shorts you can see the skin color oh I did not notice that oh my God last but not least Maria a graphic designer Maria what do you think of not only the belfine bathwater combo but the cutest PC setup so so so cute I love it I love the colors I love the RGB would you pay $250 for the Bel Delphine
bathwater combo kit the most part I guess is the she's looking back at you she's but I like this three um yeah I think it's good okay the colors are nice it looks pretty and with the whole setup like it fits perfect yeah it's in its natural home yeah overall as a collector's package I think it's actually pretty cool and the price isn't obscene however if you're buying this for just the components uh it's really not worth it the K75 while this version is really nice um it's not the best
keyboard I don't even think it's worth the $120 that it usually goes for on sale and the mouse is fine pixart sensor is really good but it's really not for me thanks for watching if you want to check out other short circuits maybe check out the Evia lineup that we went to France to look at me Andrew and Bell look they're all right here again you can't see them I can see them they're right there goodbye
