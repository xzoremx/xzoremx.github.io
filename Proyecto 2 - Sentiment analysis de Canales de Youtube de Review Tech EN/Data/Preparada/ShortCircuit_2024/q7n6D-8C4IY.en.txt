I like small computers the reason I like small computers is you can just tuck them behind your monitor or stuff them in a drawer or just get them out of the way but this is a mini computer that wants to be seen it's a mini computer from our friends at minis Forum that has a can you see it already there's a screen on this thing and not just a screen a touch screen as you can imagine not really meant to stuff this one in the drawer I guess uh probably sits okay yeah there's a stand ah this is making
more sense is it an adjustable stand oh look at that that's got some niceo she's stiff it doesn't have screws so you can't make it stiff again if it becomes loose but that it's pretty good to start clip it on there and you can see Boom the mini form Adam man x7t I bet the ti stands for titanium it's a little computer with a 4in touchcreen on it why I don't know look at that it's so quaint and shiny I mean fingerprints wise like look look at this there's some other stuff
going on here what is that is that a do look like microphones oh God it's a computer with a webcam you guys know how much I liked the last one of those this one kind of makes sense though cuz you have to have it front and center for the the touchcreen so you might as well stick a webcam on there we've got some cables in the Box h HMI cable which mini form pretty much always includes nice touch we got the little Mickey ears to a standard  brick in Chinese okay never mind and
that's it for the Box this is 120 watts that's a lot of juice on the outside on the top okay this part of the io is at least smart if you need an SD card slot it's basically as convenient as it possibly could be oh look at that do you see what's happening here look at this look it's got a physical blocker dad so you can actually disable the webcam which is very nice when it's a webcam that's physically integrated into the device power button lots of ventilation here I mean we got 12 120 W power brick
so I imagine uh it needs it we've got this guy here we've got that guy there and some ventilation on the bottom on this side we've got the DC power in an HDMI 2.1 Port always nice to see some manner of USB type A the blue one I think this is a 5 gig port cuz they list that there's one 5 gig and two 10 gig type A's we'll see the rest of those in a second we've got a USB 2.0 type A we've got display port 2.0 they don't list the throughput rate so I'll see if I can figure that out before the end of
this video two 5 gig ethernet Jacks a USB 4 and ocul Link is 5 gig making a comeback this is the first recent product I've seen that actually is integrating it again which is great because yeah doubl the speed of even 2.5 gig five times the speed of 1 gig that oculink Port is great if you want to run an egpu mini form even actually makes an oculink dock that you can buy for a somewhat reasonable price uh but this is a pcie Gen 4 by4 connection inside of here it's not Thunderbolt even though
there is this USB 4 which you also could use for an egpu it's just like a straight pcie connection which is pretty nice cuz there's a little bit less overhead there are the other USB type A ports I was talking about these are likely 10 gig and then we've got another USB 4 combo audio and a reset button that's pretty much it for Io that looks great on my desk I wish the stand had some thought put into like cable management like if the ports came out of the bottom and it was a little
bit taller stand that kind of hid them that would be cool or like hey how about put the io on the back maybe huh it's not the worst thing I've ever seen but it's not the best all right boom Hey look it's this message from our sponsor thanks to Asphalt Legends for sponsoring this video rev up for asphalt Legends unite bring your progress from Asphalt 9 and dive into action-packed racing with over 250 hypercars and stunning new graphics race through the thrilling Singapore track and enjoy the
freedom of crossplay on PS5 PS4 Android iOS PC Nintendo switch Xbox and steam deck connect with friends in multiplayer and Co-op modes across all platforms with special launch rewards and the ES L finals that games gone on August 25th there's never been a better time to join the race check it out in the description oh wow it's got like stuff on it already who look at that wow I've got this wonderful color appropriate very stealthy cable to plug into the side of this thing all right
specs wise we've got a core Ultra 9 185h this is a meteor Lake chip with some AI stuff built in we got 32 gigs of RAM a 1 tbte Kingston SSD you can also order this thing as a Bare Bones which I would encourage you to do because you can probably get a better deal on the SSD and RAM yourself we can see the 5 gig ethernet I mentioned earlier and then also Intel Wi-Fi 7 which should be pretty fast I don't have a Wi-Fi 7 access point here to try it with um but we'll we'll do a little speed test in a
second here I've been informed that there is no software I mean it's reading stats there's a piece of software on here called sccs I am not familiar with it doesn't seem to launch but I think that might be the background app that does the like communication let's see how accurate are we talking here 42 Dees on the CPU package says 43 there that's close enough right oh yeah there's a few second delay looks like maybe 3 seconds but it does actually seem to read the spec somewhat accurately I'm sure it's
just pulling from the sensors through that piece of software what if we try like a speed test does it update let's see oh yeah look at that they say it's a 480p screen so I guess it's 480 x 480 given that it's a square it is a touch screen so we can adjust our system volume we can adjust the screen brightness what does this USB button do device interface whoa oh look it tells you it's a map of the ports that's kind of cute except it says USB 3.2 on all three of these blue ones very
helpful uh what else we got here does this display other things mode adjustment ooh performance mode does this just change the power profile and can you even like oh yeah it's making noise now it doesn't this is doing something else it uh slightly adjusts the CPU GPU balance for the wage what else we got in here clock how do I is there not other screens like swipe how do I do oh oh look at that wow we got fancy clocks this is Apple watch now this seem this seems like what most people would
display on this screen you know like it's got a clock on the computer it looks okay it's not going to be the most customizable thing in the world you can't like drag and drop stuff but you can at least change the languages and slightly adjust where things are I mean I'm not mad about it it's cool that it's not just like a display port connection to your PC and you have to run some like stupid software in the background although there is some software in the background let's try the
webcam I'm sure it's great oh man look at that that's lovely this is actually that that's it's pretty good actually does that not look pretty good it looks pretty I mean we're at like half Studio lighting half not very lit it does look good even in the dark I mean there's still one light above me but it's pretty dark in here and it's a little noisier but for a webcam like seriously all right boys and girls let's see this go Burr hey look at that 5 gigabit dude 5 gig is sick if just more things
supported it it would be much better but pretty freaking sick naturally we should  too it's a it's an Intel Wi-Fi chipset it's fast I mean realistically this AP seems to max out at about 600 unless you're on 6 GHz so yeah good 700 up look at that boom it's an APU is I mean this is like a top chip with integrated Graphics it's not going to blow your socks off but it will play games like rocket League at 1080p pretty decently or if you're using it as like a little hdpc it's going to do that totally fine
for comparison we looked at an Asus zephrus g16 uh with the dedicated GPU turned off so it's basically the exact same chip as in here at that point and and generally it was faster it doesn't seem like the balance versus performance mode makes a huge difference um if anything it's within an FPS or two but it also is very possible that the g16 is thermal throttling cuz they like to do that this thing doesn't seem to I mean it's it's relatively quiet let's see how loud it gets this is in the balance
profile right now and cinebench is one of the situations where you could actually see a difference between balanced and performance mode even though it didn't make much of a difference in games I mean it's pretty quiet right now if this was sitting on my desk next to my monitor I think it would get annoying if I wasn't wearing headphones or if I had open back headphones this would drive me crazy I mean the exhaust is like right upwards in your face it just kind of sounds like a a laptop it's
a quiet laptop here this will give you a  mode balance mode it's way quieter when you move to non-performance tests like blender or photoshop a g16 is a touch faster but we're pretty much in the same range um so it performance as expected I don't know if anyone is looking to buy this thing as a performance monster but it it would it would do calculations pretty much as to your expectations I can't imagine it's getting that hot oh it's click I should be trying to score here ah hey thanks
teammate I'm a little disappointed in the noise levels I mean minis for them their mini computers are usually pretty good noise wise but the screen obviously causes a little bit of ventilation uh constraints let's look at the temps here this is in Balance mode for the reference more like CPU package I mean it's all over the place as a game but getting up into 75 and our package power is at like 37 watts and it's this loud all that's left now is to take it apart hey I don't know how good it is to
put a magnet near your computer but the LTT Cable Management Keyhole thingies that you usually use for Power Bars just barely fit in there it's it's not really in there but it's in there enough and now watch this your webcam can be mounted at a very convenient location yeah Jokes Aside you could you could stick this on the side of your computer or like if you have a metal wall or a fridge beside your computer this is the thing they keep doing minis for please God make the feet not get
destroyed when you want to take the computer apart I don't understand this like there you go great I can take it apart by just destroying these little rubber feet because they're sticky usually you can stick them back on but like just don't put the screws to take the computer apart underneath the freaking feet hello sir can I get some open please whoa the ports are on a daughter board why would they do that how am I supposed to detach this that's a big cooling apparatus it's big fan explains
why it's so noisy that's a lot of screws man I don't know if I'm trying to take  now damn look at them heat pipes woo that was Hefty why is this thing so loud we've got the two sodm slots where you can put up to 96 gigs of ddr5 memory you got a little graphine actually thick  pads what are these crucial 5600 cool and over here we can see the two M do2s this is the 2280 it comes with this a Gen 4 slot and then there's also a 2230 slot if you want to put a second SSD I am going to take this little board off
because I want to see the back of the screen you're supposed to take the cooler off before you do this oh God yeah there we go look at that if you need to do this for whatever reason take the uh little been cable out of here and take the CPU Cooler off first because yep oh the camos battery it's on the back brother I mean they give you a reset button but if you need to get at that that's a pain in the and then there's the Wi-Fi card which also pain in to get it the screen definitely can
just come out now that those screws are taken out this screen module has an SD card slot on it that's weird oh that ribbon C this ribbon cable is not for the screen this is for the camera it says right there well it's a mini computer with a screen on it it seems to perform as it should it's a little bit noisy the screen doesn't act as a desktop screen if you're hoping for that it's just those displays or a clock the webcam is pretty good and it's kind of expensive this is
$669 Bare Bones that means no SSD and no Ram it's not cheap if you want it with 32 gigs of RAM a 1 TB SSD and with the egpu doc you're looking at 8.99 us as of right now I mean if you if you want this I don't think it's the worst thing in the world um but also you probably don't need this just buy like a790 or a890 it's cheaper and probably faster and less noisy and smaller so thanks for watching if you like this video maybe check out the time that I looked at that minis form that just had a webcam
integrated into it it was strange then is still a bit strange but that one's webcam actually still works at the end of the video
