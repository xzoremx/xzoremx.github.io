ah what in the world was that maybe I can use my other both of my phones exploded what on Earth will I do when I need to wake up in the morning aha Nintendo has the answer the alarmo Nintendo sound clock also known as alarm clock what obviously my first thought when I saw the press release was what a weird thing for Nintendo to make right but if you think about it Nintendo has made all kinds of things that are not games and game consoles and an alarm clock far from the weirdest one let's
take a closer look I remember reading an interview about it where they said they wanted it to look more friendly and less like a conventional alarm clock I'd say they've probably achieved that you've got a couple little rubberized feed on the bottom a USBC power port a Nintendo logo on the back what looks like a speaker Grill is this the snooze button man that is an enticing looking snooze button and the best part you don't even need to use the snooze button it has a motion sensor
and you can just gesture at it in order to snooze we'll talk a little bit more about the motion sensor later but we've also got a mail button and back button let's get it set up Nintendo recommends pointing it toward the center of the bed and having it no more than 8 in above the head of the sleeper this allows it to use its motion sensor for a variety of things it can track when you are in bed so the alarm won't go off if you're not home it can track your movement in
your sleep which Nintendo assures you is never sent back to Nintendo's servers and it can allow you to silence or snooze your alarm by simply waving at it from in the bed or getting up but there is one small complication Belle if you would if you happen to be a Nintendo customer who isn't a child which Nintendo stubbornly refuses to acknowledge as a thing and you share your bed with another person the motion controls won't work because as no way knowing which person is I don't know
waving at it or getting out of the bed or doing whatever else but enough about what it can't do let's see what it can do using the power of our sponsor Paradox who's featuring their new turn-based strategy game Age of Wonders 4 while the end of the year feasts might be conquering your stomach you can rule over a Fantasy realm in this unique Forex turn-based Extravaganza you can control a huge variety of Empires and unique races to dominate through cunning alliances or with raw strength and with
their new event system the world continuously evolves depending on your actions the best part is you can play for free from November 7th to 11th at the link in the video description here we go it comes with five games pre-loaded what breath of the wild Odyssey and I think ringfit adventure and like two other ones but you can download more and there's a little tutorial here okay let's have a look we twist the knob we push the knob oh that's fun select English yes the setting is okay
yes you can use the back button if you want to go back to the previous screen I sure can English is still okay though and now it wants today's date which in a world where time servers exist and this is a smart device feels a little bass Awards but sure turn the dial to razor lower the volume that is not a very loud alarm clock as someone who was a very sound teenage sleeper place the clock on a flat surface then move your body left  okay uh all right Glenn things are about
to get a little complicated I think I get the  coins yeah we thought other alarm clocks were insufficient so we did this did I get the coin I somehow got the coin okay the clock's motion sensor can tell when you move your body try lying in bed and then press the button for next how the hell am I supposed to do that do I need a helper to set this thing up I mean I guess I probably have a parent to help me with it right CU I had sleep alone kids and forever alone that's the Nintendo
demographic there's two different modes for the alarm it can either be at a constant volume or it can escalate and apparently there's different characters that can show up to like try and Rouse you if you're like snoozing it too many  oh I have to keep moving sure next stop the Alarm by getting out of bed I'm going to throw it for a loop I'm going to get out this way hey all right it worked get back in bed look at this thing you can't tell me what to do you're not my real dad
alarmo this is the most fun I've ever had setting up an alarm clock I will say that okay that is one compl that I've seen about this thing there's only one alarm time supported so you can't just like have multiple alarms for different days of the week which um really anyway Links at a campfire no way no question it's kind of cute definitely cool but what I got to know Belle how much does this thing cost it costs $100 100 bucks I feel like there are a lot of different lenses I could look through
this from on the one hand $100 is very expensive for functionality that you're literally holding in your pocket right now on the other hand for a first-party Nintendo product I mean they've got plastic statues that literally don't have anything in them this was probably more work than an amiibo and like an amiibo I feel like it has more value as a collectible than it does as a functional product though with that said Nintendo did put a shocking amount of actual thought into it like they're
treating it like a real product even though they kind of didn't really have to do that another cool thing and I don't take this for granted these days is that no Nintendo account is required in order to use the product we did set one up so that we could download new themes and stuff but you don't have to which for a product that is clearly intended mostly for kids is a definite plus Nintendo is not a perfect company but they are one that seems to take user privacy at least reasonably seriously
beyond that there's not really much for me to say if you're the kind of person who wants one of these you already know who you are and if you're the kind of person who thinks this is phenomenally stupid you know who you are too and I know who I am I'm the guy who's going to tell you guys to subscribe to Short Circuit
