M Prestige you can't spell that without MSI what we've got right here today is the MSI Prestige 16 AI Evo and it looks like it could be a real good one so huge thanks to MSI for sponsoring this video and let's get right into it got a quick guide for charging we have a 100 W brick that's actually quite nice and small maybe gallium nitride and it is delivering that 100 wats over USB type-c which I do really like to see that means that if say you forget this you can just plug in your laptop to your phone
charger and charge it that way now what you might have noticed is that this says AI in the name and it isn't complete bogus it has Intel's new core Ultra chips inside of it which has a neural Computing chip which allows it to just like accelerate AI workloads such as stable diffusion even just like AI blurring the windows windows so they use less power when it's doing like transparency and stuff like that it is is actually kind of useful one thing a lot of notebooks these days get wrong
especially when they're trying to be thin and light is the I/O and fortunately MSI has not made that mistake here on the right hand side we have a 3.5 mm headphone microphone combo Jack fullsize SD card rear every photographer is super stoked to about that one and a fullsize ethernet port on the back we have fullsize HDMI love to see that USB type A and two Thunderbolt 4 ports and on the right hand side we have a Kensington lock and that is it just couple of fins MSI in their notes
for this says that it's ultra thin and ultra light but it looks not the most thin I'm kind of curious oh I see what's happening here this is one of those ones where the laptop itself is actually pretty thin but they have these feet down on the bottom so that has nice and lots of room for the air intake so I'm guessing that the thermal performance is pretty good and that's why when I just had it on the table it seemed kind of thick even though it actually is right around 19 mm thick and that is not what
I would consider ultra thin but at the same time I think that it's a good compromise because it is a tiny bit thicker but also like full size ethernet fulls size HDMI I think a lot of you guys know which one you would rather have between thin and usable IO MSI claims The Prestige 16 is 3.3 lb let's see how this one is 3.44 not bad not bad I'm guessing we have just a little bit extra Ram or something the actual weights of things can change a fair bit from config to config like you get this
with a 4070 I imagine that's adding an extra like 3 400 G to it the overall look of the prestige 16 is quite nice it does have that professional feel it does have actually reefing on it pretty hard right now and it has except exeptional chassis rigidity that's being provided by an aluminum and magnesium blend for the chassis is it fingerprint resistant though that's yeah that's pretty good I'm like half a greasy one right now and this is yeah you have to shine it straight into the light to see those
fingerprints so good job there MSI the chassis around the keyboard and the trackpad is also really nice and firm there's a little bit of a soft spot over here at the same time that's pad area so I'm not super duper concerned about that msi's build quality in their laptops has just completely changed over the last couple of years and I'm really impressed with just how wellb built this thing is this has an OLED panel I don't even need to look at my notes to tell you that
much just using my eyeballs I can pretty easily tell you that this is a fantastic looking display but our Labs did have a sniff of it and it's actually kind of interesting first of all it is quite good but what's interesting is that in SDR the accuracy of the panel is actually pretty bad with an average Delta e of 4.8 which is way higher than the two that we would expect for professional work which is what this is aimed at everything's a lot more vibrant than it should be and we weren't able to
find any obvious ways to stop that but if you just turn on HDR okay that just looks way better so you enable HDR and it's quite accurate in HDR right around that 2 that we expect of the Delta e but turning on HDR also makes it way more accurate in SDR for some reason so there's not really any reason to not just turn on HDR and windows cuz then the color mapping of this display in all of your content is just way better why that is I don't know but it's just one click right here and you're good also
the peak brightness of this display is 600 nits so that's bright enough that you might be able to go outside and work on this although it is quite shiny and really it's an OLED so where it's really really going to shine is in dark rooms where you can just see those completely black blacks it's just oh darn no touchcreen though that's unfortunate but what is fortunate is that in here we have an Intel Core Ultra 7 155h in this one right here you can go up to an ultra 9 in this one we have 16 cores so that's
six performance cores eight efficiency and a total of 22 threads this thing goes up to 4.8 GHz which is just ripping "fast also quite fast 6,400 megga" transfer pers second ram 32 GB of the stuff is in here it does say it's a row of chips so chances are we can't upgrade that in the future but such is a thin and light one thing we just realized that is strange is that if you have six performance cores and eight efficiency cores that is 14 cores but it says that it has 16 and that's because it also has
two ultra low power efficiency cores which are honestly I don't really know what those do besides use way less power than the already efficient cores but good job Intel for storage we have 1 tab Wi-Fi it's a killer Wi-Fi 7 cards so that should be ripping fast if your router is able to do Wi-Fi 7 GPU it's Intel arc graphics that's built onto the chip now this is available with up to a 4070 so if you want to do less like photo editing and more hardcore video editing I might suggest that you go for
the 4060 or the 4070 version of this although we weren't able to test those so maybe just look up how good it is somewhere else also we have Intel's npu this is dedicated to accelerating AI tasks so doing stuff like uh stable diffusion in you can do different stuff within Lightroom classic and just general AI things how is the  the keyboard overall is pretty decent I would give it maybe like a B minus somewhere around there it's been a real sore point for MSI for years and years
and it has gotten a lot better as they have improved the chassis rigidity but it still isn't quite there like if you look the key stability if I push on the side isn't fantastic there's a lot of deflection from the key before it starts to actuate and that can hurt your speed and your accuracy and there's definitely some inconsistencies like on hours the J key takes less Force to press than the K key maybe something like a 15% variance or something like that when you normally
expect more like 10 or five on a really high-end laptop that said though after a while I was able to get mostly used to it and some of those inconsistencies do still rear their heads as a little bit of not the accuracy that that I would expect to have on a keyboard like this but a lot of you might trade that for the inclusion of a numpad on the right A lot of people I know and like myself when I'm using solid works absolutely love having a numpad over here and that can
be the make or break of if you want this laptop for your actual professional job one area though where MSI has just knocked it out of the park on this is the trackpad now it is over to the left to align it with the keyboard and not the numpad which I do dig it's glass topped it's accurate it's really nice and large and overall just no complaints about the trackpad good job there all right so I'm gaming at 1080p here first of all rocket League looks absolutely fantastic on this OLED monitor it is 60
HZ but OLED has super quick response times which does mean that things look absolutely fantastic and it should play really quite well although it's not the best gaming experience that I've ever had one thing for performance that's nice that MSI has here is the MSI AI engine so that smartly just changes between your various power modes depending on what you're doing and that's great because I've seen the data from a bunch of different companies and only like 10% of people actually take
the time to go like Extreme Performance mode balance silence super battery and stuff like that most people never look at that ever and having it just be AI engine it figures it out for you and it's probably mostly really quite good we've had rocket Leo for like five or so minutes let's see how hot she's getting 46 so that's pretty borderline if I'm honest it looks like that the keys themselves are in the 42 range which is okayish although if we look at right up at the top here this aluminum is
conducting quite a bit of heat that's uh 48Â° it'll take a while to burn you but that will burn you so don't uh don't hold your hand here while it's rendering even though this might be a little bit hotter than I wanted it is at least not very loud like I don't know if you can hear it right now but I barely can and like holding it up like this you can hear a bit from the bottom but on the desk the amount of noise that the fans are making is really quite reasonable okay all right that's
respectable it's not the loudest laptop that I've ever heard but at the same time staging is good Clarity is good and they haven't just like cranked up the volume to where the poor speakers distort and stuff it's all nice and clear even if there isn't a whole lot of Base in there crab Rave is also just so good for showing off how Fantastic oleds look like look at that pitch black that is nighttime right there now on to the webcam so we have a 1080p webcam up here and the first thing that I really like
is this little switch right here you can just hard disable it I really really appreciate these kind of little switches so that you know for sure that your webcam is not looking at you when you don't want it to coming in here though it looks fine it's kind of noisy but not too bad but speaking of noisy gentlemen we now have two laptops playing 10 hours of construction sounds now MSI says that their AI noise cancellation Pro works really quite well so let's uh just turn that on for a bit
and maybe it sounds way better or maybe it doesn't we'll find out in a second damn that worked really well that is sick I do have to say MSI good job on the AI noise cancelling now uh I do have a little surprise for you guys second laptop it's the same thing but 3 in smaller a it's so cute and also like quite nice it really does achieve the be being very thin and very light that MSI said that the 16 is but 16 is pretty large 13 is much more manageable but you are giving up things
like there's no ethernet there's no fullsize SD card reader but if what you're looking for is something that's just super duper nice and thin Prestige 13 13 also has an OLED display it has a keyboard that is quite similar to the 16 slightly smaller touchpad but I'm not too concerned about with that and it also has a 75w battery which in a laptop of this size is very very impressive we also have a 99 W hour in this one but that's kind of what you expect in a 16in 75 W hours is really really good in a 13
in eight Phillips head screws later all of which are the same size and wow that's where the GPU goes wow there's just nothing there normally you see like you know the heat pipes going over to another fan so that your CPU has a higher TDP but they're just like no the there's there's a gap now the good news in here is that we have two SSD slots so we have the one TB from the factory and if you want to upgrade it there's another one that is just nice and free is it free when you
get a GPU I'm not entirely sure but uh it is without the GPU we know that much also unfortunately the ram is soldered down right here which does allow you to have higher speeds but you can't upgrade it in the future so make sure you get enough when you purchase the laptop the real star of the show in here is the 99.9 wat hour battery now that is just a hair under what you're allowed to take on a plane and it gets us over 10 hours of battery life which you might be thinking uh we
don't even have a dedicated GPU why isn't it more than that and that's largely down to the OLED panel oleds just suck back battery life and that's why we need this AB absolutely massive thing to compensate for that so that you can have those just actually stunning visuals that it is able to provide now of course this video is sponsored so take my recommendation with a grain of salt but I'm actually quite impressed with the price the config that we have right here 1 TB SSD 32 GB of RAM and
"that fantastic 4K OLED panel is $1,00 us" which for that is actually quite good if you want something a little bit less than 13in comes in at a starting price of $1050 and it can go up from there and of course this right here if you want to outfit it with a 4060 or 4070 it can get pretty pricey pretty fast but this configurate here particularly I am quite impressed with and of course I'm impressed with MSI for sponsoring this video huge thanks guys for watching hit like get subscribed and
just have a great old day
