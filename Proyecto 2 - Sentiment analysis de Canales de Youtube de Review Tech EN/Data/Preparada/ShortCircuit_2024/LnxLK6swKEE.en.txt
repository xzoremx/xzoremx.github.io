I was already regretting my purchase the last time I looked at the latest QD olet panel but gigabyte said hold my beer and they released the world's first 4K 240 HZ OLED gaming monitor with DP 2.1 in the fo 32 u2p that's right no longer when you get a 4K 240 HZ monitor are you going to be limited to using display stream compression if you want to actually utilize all of that resolution and all of those frames because let me tell you when you're going 4K 240 it's eating up something like almost 70 gbit
per second of bandwidth we've got our big old stand here for a 32in monitor this is pretty typical double column I'm a big fan of the double column design just feels more sturdy I don't know if it actually is but it feels like you get twice as much we've got some cables I really hope this is a oh my God look at this this is my first time seeing one of these I think dp80 that's uhb 20 which is 80 gb per second which is that's insane I can't believe how much bandwidth you're getting from that put
that how short is this thing cuz uh one thing about cables that a lot of you might not realize is that the especially as the spec goes up they have to get shorter and so this is like a 3ot display port cable so if you're using this and you're actually using DP 2.1 I really hope your computer is like right next to your monitor uh cuz it's going to have to be we might run into some issues later it also comes with rala plastica gigabyte monitor product warranty card that's great don't need
that we've got a USB C Toc cable because this has a KVM in it got a laptop plug it in Boop hit the switch you're good to go we've got Ultra highspeed HDMI this is an HDMI 2.1 cable which is only going to reach about 40 GB per second not enough this is no longer enough now that we've reached 4K 240 HZ then we've got a USB a Tob our power cable which is not a North American plug what else we got the right plug a C13 another one what is this a different cable maybe they'll send you all three just in case we've
also got our big old power brick Oh this is pretty big it's pretty heavy we've got the other part of our stand you know the part that actually connects to the monitor we're ready this is a shotgun rack it's the very typical you know stick the columns in put them together and screw it down ni nice and easy uh the bigger the monitor the heavier the stand and the heavier the monitor is going to be uh you know I actually this is kind of nice says aorus Design Lab on the back
there it's really hard to see and this is going to be facing the wall so you're never going to see it but I think it looks pretty and I really like it another thing that I really like is the slit in the back of here so it actually makes getting into this really easy you're just going to click clack pull it out also it's flat so anyone wanting a flat 16x9 display here's another one it's finally happening the other advantage to that is that the Box isn't enormous I mean it's a 32-in monitor so it is still
pretty big keep your box because this thing comes with a three-year warranty which is absolutely fantastic covers OLED buron which is a big point for a lot of people it's basically why I am okay with buying oleds Now for PC gaming and just desktop usage in general 3 years if you're not burning in after 3 years you're probably taking care of your monitor pretty well who knows maybe burnin's right around the corner I don't know I still haven't experienced it Labs clearly took a look
at it cuz we've got this bubbly on the screen as they reapplied it that's fine the nice thing is that a lot of people have been complaining about about the other models is that it comes with just the foam and it doesn't actually have a screen protector on the front and so I haven't seen any micr scratches myself but people are seeing them apparently so this is just a nice little added bonus layer of protection uh the only problem now is I got to take this off okay I got it I got it I got it I got [Applause]
it of course it's cutie OLED we have studio lights shining directly at this thing and so it is slightly magenta instead of black as someone who owns a couple of these things now when you're in your home and it's just like overhead regular house lighting you really don't see it that much um and then as soon as it's on you don't even notice it at all so I get it people complain about it they don't like it I I I think you're nitpicking over something really minor that doesn't really matter I'm sorry
otherwise the stand is great it swivels at the base which I I am a big fan of um a little more would be nice but this is pretty typical and that's fine otherwise pretty good amount of height adjustment I would still like to see it Go basically all the way down to the base but that's fine um got a bunch of tilt it's actually a pretty good amount I don't know who will ever use this like this I pretty much just keep my monitors flat but to each their own if you have a use case cool another great feature I
don't have to take this off the stand to show you the io because it can do portrait I don't think any of you should ever use it like this until maybe 10 years from now because you've got something crazy that point cuz like really it's are you really going to spend this much money and put a 4K 240 HZ Monitor and portrait I'm not um but to each their own anyway as for Io we've got two HDMI 2.1 ports our DP 2.1 mini DP 2.1 you've actually got two options and then a DP out because it can daisy
chain fantastic USBC with 65 watts of charging then we got something else that I actually don't think I've ever seen a non-combo jack so there's one dedicated for Mike and dedic ated for headphones wild usbb and then a couple of usba a ports power so this thing really just kind of has it all uh on the bottom we've also got our handy dandy navigation nipple which is my preferred way to scroll through the OSD and then a couple of buttons I'm assuming one is for power one is probably for the KVM
we'll check that out in a little bit all right let's game on it we noticed two things as we plugged it in one our DP 2.1 cable is actually a DP 2.1 Mini to regular DP for uh br20 I got so excited didn't even notice and then the other thing we forgot that our 490 does not have DP 2.1 so we're going to throw a Radeon graphics card in there later but for now we're just going to try it out and see how it goes uh but yeah that's how future proof this thing is a 4090 doesn't even have 2.1 although that's
more of nvidia's problem so whatever uh this is not 240 HZ this looks bad so we're going to go Advanced and we're GNA go 240 HZ 4K it's 8 bit for SDR so we're going to go out here and go use HDR now we got 10 bit and that's sweet sweet HDR and uh I got to say you know it looks good it's the same panel I've been looking at before the real advantage to this guy is just that I/O like DP 2.1 is simply not available elsewhere so if you want it this is your only option let's watch
some stuff on YouTube to make sure the HDR looks good I'm sure it does this is one of those videos that we end up making almost entirely by it's got speakers they're just a couple of five Watts nothing major but very much appreciated because for those few times where you don't have speakers you don't have headphones it doesn't matter if it's not good it is audio and that is better than nothing I'll tell you that much 4K HDR oh doesn't Andy look great here the black of that sweater that he's
got on it's so crispy but you can see all the details and the fur and everything or whatever it is one nice thing about gigabyte is actually really like their SD especially with the navigation system that they've got it's got free sync premium Pro it's pretty great we have got hdr on oh we've got HDR game HDR movie HDR hlg HDR Vivid I would probably stick to HDR oh one thing too that actually like it tells you it's in the mini DP slot specifically we'll get to testing later but we checked out
the regular HDR by default and uh no spoilers but it's pretty accurate as for display we've got you know input tells you type C mini DP DP all that stuff KVM switch wizard uh daisy chaining is on we're not daisy chaining anything RGB range that's great apply picture mode sure it's got pip and PBP which is always a very useful uh feature for certain people I don't ever use it but I don't have multiple systems that I want to um assign different pictures too one more pretty cool feature is this little
button down here the Tactical switch that turns it into to a 24 1/2 in display ah wait wait I there it is um this is for if you're you know practicing for Esports or something the reality is it's 240 htz so it's very capable very capable display and it's really nice having it on a single button down here cuz you just switch back and forth no problem at all very nice to have do I use it no but I also don't play orts at least not anymore another major feature that you've got is OLED
care um right in the OSD here it's activating usage Time 5 hours oh that's great I actually love how it tells you the usage time oh yeah pixel clean start cleaning static control on Pixel shift on APL stabilize middle Su logo dim Corner dim reset set this is great this is just a really big part of why I'm especially coupled with the three-year warranty and why I'm not worried about burning don't get me wrong I am careful I have autohide taskbar I have Dynamic wallpaper uh on my background I shut my monitor
off if I'm going to walk away from my desk for a few hours you know and I've definitely made mistakes and just like left it on for the weekend and it is totally fine at least and that's the last gen this is a new gen so let's try some games it looks incredible we're on Ultra nightmare it's Doom Eternal it's it's an old game now but like guess what I'm getting around 200 FPS for the most part um everything cranked 4K like God this game is so well optimized it just looks amazing those flashes just looks
so good I can't wait to this is great I can't wait to watch it from a regular monitor cuz for some reason cuti OLED just looks so good through other displays it just picks it up so well but yeah it's amazing there's not much else to say I don't know what to tell you guys it's the same panel that I've been gawking at for the last little while and just being constantly impressed by so enough about gaming for now let's talk about the results for color accuracy in srgb we have an average of just one
Delta e with a 2.2 on the max very impressive similar to what we've seen from this generation of cded panels absolutely beautiful as for HDR in order to hit over a th000 nits you're going to have to set it to APL or average Picture level to high as for our eotf curve it is tracking basically perfectly and that's set to high so just set it to high get your max brightness don't worry about it too much if you really don't like brightness limiting and how the panel is going to fluctuate a bit as
like really bright flashes up here on screen set it to low but the problem is you're only going to cap out at like 250 maybe 300ish nits uh on the high end and that's for 1% or full screen it's all just going to sit in that range so personally I'm going to set it to high but to each their own as for color gamut it's great we're hitting 98 or even 99% of P3 depending on how you're measuring it and it hits around 80% of bt2020 which is great as for HDR color accuracy it's fantastic we hit an average of 4.8
and a Max of9 9.2 which if you've watched any of our other recent videos covering these panels you'll know that that's just really good and an absolute leap in Improvement compared to uh just the previous generation as well as other generations of OLED panels in uh recent years last but certainly not least when it comes to latency it's only adding about6 milliseconds of latency measuring a total of 2.7 which is absolutely incredible like that's next to nothing it's great I love those things about
trying The Radeon card well as it turns out I completely forgot that while it has DP 2.1 they do not have uhb or ultra high bit rate 20 which is like I said before 80 gbit per second and we're going to need about 6970 to actually take advantage of 4K 240 without any kind of compression this has uhb 13.5 which is only about 50 53 gbit per second which isn't going to do it so no matter what graphics card you have right now outside of like a couple of workstation cards you're not going to be
able to take full advantage of this display who knows 50 Series is coming out and I mean maybe the 8000 series is coming out but maybe they just do 2.1 and uh uhb 13.5 so whenever you do go to shop for your next graphics card if you do buy the fo32 u2p don't just trust the DP 2.1 on the box instead look it up and see if they're actually offering uh br20 back to the rest of the video the best part is to get this DP 2.1 connection even though most of us aren't even going to be able to use it right away it's
only $12.99 now I know I say only but the reality is I was fully expecting this to have an extra like $200 added to the price tag when you compare it to other brands coming out with the same panel and similar monitors that's right about bang on that's really close to what everyone else is charging so yeah it came out a little later and uh it definitely kind of hits me in the heart a little bit because I was an early adopter and I wanted to buy one right away really wish I had a DP 2.1 but for
anyone else who hasn't bought one yet of course a lower price would be fantastic but for it to be priced at the same thing that's just that's that's great that's gravy it's money it's fantastic it's so good it's so good you guys and if you want something even better if you want to save another Buck if you want to save two 100 bucks to be exact you can get the fo32 U2 nonp it doesn't have DP 2.1 but it does save you money you also don't get daisy chaining out of the display port which
is like it does kind of suck but it's really not necessary just run two cables however the other kind of thing that might bite you is you only get 18 watts of power delivery on the USBC which it's enough but if you've got a laptop you really want that 65 on the fo 27 Q3 it is of course only 1440p but it is 360 htz so you kind of got some trade-off there 360 HZ with OLED Lightning Fast pixel response times is near perfect motion Clarity 240 looks amazing but it's definitely not quite as crisp so
pick the one that's right for you and then if both of those are still out of your price range or you just want a smaller monitor because let's be real sometimes 32 in is too big for people's desks you can get the f27 Q three for $800 it's really good it's kind of unbelievable just how far this play Tech has come in the last few years it's like CPUs just a couple years ago and I'm just really excited about it still because everything year-over-year keeps impressing me and I can't wait to see
what comes out next thanks for watching short circuit thanks to gigabyte for sending this over and sponsoring this video if you want to pick up any of the three that we talked about or showed today there's going to be a link in the description below and if you want to check out another video there's bound to be one down there too see you later
