look I get it everybody wants faster internet right it's a universally understood principle people want fast internet you like your games to download fast you like your movies to stream well you like your music to stream well and if you're looking to upgrade beyond your internet service providers Wi-Fi or router ubiquity is a great option and something we've shown off before but they haven't really had anything on the router side in the price class that makes sense for normal people unless
you're like an Enthusiast like me and you like to spend money on things that really don't metet you that much more but might be kind of cool and fun to Tinker with well this is a new Option from ibiquity the cloud Gateway Max it's a 2.5 gig something that has been kind of missing router network controller NVR all in this tiny little box and it's only 200 bucks which for this feature set is a price point that has not existed up until now at least from ubiquity what else we got in the Box
here power brick yep oh look this is one of those new fandangled ether lighting does this have ether lighting I don't think so oh my God if it did that would be hilarious I'll have to find that out in a sec screws little fies if you want to put it on your desk power cable propaganda that's it now because this is a router it might not be the most visually exciting thing but it is very Sleek we've got a little just about 1 in sideways I don't know probably half an inch third of an inch tall LCD screen on
the front that'll show some statistics got some ventilation on the bottom on the side this is huge because the other options in this price point like the dream router which is also $200 might have Wi-Fi but if you want to expand the storage for your UniFi protect security cameras it only had micro SD which is kind of crappy this is an m.2 slot it can fit up to a 22 110 I think which is a fulls size like Enterprise SSD I will say that at $200 it doesn't come with the sled that makes an SSD fit in here
uh if you buy one of the more expensive options which come with included storage it does come with the sled I'm not huge on this one I mean I get it if somebody doesn't need it don't charge them for it and don't include it but also it seems like a part that would cost like a dollar and uh they charge 20 bucks for it if you don't buy the option that includes it I'm sure somebody's going to 3D print a thing that'll make it work or something like that but for now no bueno if you go with the $200 base option
we've got a little reset button to reset the config USBC power in and then this the star of the show 2.5 gig Wan port and four 2.5 gig Lan ports I can't tell you how many times I've seen this you get a 1.5 gig or 2 gig internet connection and the Wi-Fi router that you get has a 2.5 gig in and only 1 gig out so you're not even taking advantage of it unless you have like a billion Wi-Fi devices streaming at the same time which let's be honest it probably can't even handle that either in this setup you've
got 2.5 g on all the ports and you can actually configure one of the Lan ones to also be another Wan Port which is a nice touch I mean that's pretty much it on the outside it's a router it's an NVR it's a network controller it supposedly can handle 30 UniFi devices under control which is sick I mean for a small business one of these things would be freaking awesome it also has intrusion detection and protection at speeds of up to 1.5 gig which is not the full line right but remember this is also a $200
device which is pretty sick let's get this thing plugged in all right I'm not sure why they didn't just stick these on from the factory I know that they have an optional wall mount accessory which also seems like something that probably should have just been included I don't know I'm conflicted because I like that this is very cost effective it's not that expensive for what you're getting I don't know what the equivalent from other providers looks like but even just buying like a 5 Port 2.5 gig switch from
a bigname brand is not that cheap let me look online really quick all right TP Link 5 Port they say multi- gigabit but it's a 2.5 gig switch 100 bucks us this one's got 10 gig on it that's cool 125 that's like half the budget right there gone this one has two 2.5 gig ports which is better than what we've seen so far but the rest of them are gigabit and it is $200 at least on Raw specs here we're looking better than that and this is also an NVR so this does quite a bit get our cables plugged in here we got
our W cable bam oh look at that that it's a message from our sponsor pulseway managing your it systems doesn't need to be difficult and our sponsor pulseway makes performing important actions on your system simpler while having complete visibility into your network from anywhere all you need is pulseway on your phone and you can monitor manage and troubleshoot your workstations so take control of your servers patches and it systems with pulseway today by using our link down in the description to save

special connector you totally could 3D print this $80 is not gouging one ter is $150 premium so 350 and the 2 terb it's two 280 this better be a good SSD in here youbi I swear to god let's find out this isn't actually even available yet so if you buy the no SSD one you're not going to be buying this drive sled thing till September 23rd so keep that in mind if you are ordering one swear to God this better not be a cheap SSD I'm going to be mad okay Kingston Gen 4 nvme drive not a generic crappy one
which is a good sign however how much does this SD cost okay I actually found the exact SSD on Mouser to buy one it's $90 if you buy $5 the pricing goes down to 72 I imagine they probably bought thousands so I suspect the pricing would be cheaper but I would have to call for a quote it's cool that it's Gen 4 though and at least it is a good quality Drive I don't know what the compatibility is like I suspect that it's only going to be pcie ssds but it doesn't say on their
website It also says only up to 2 tabt but I don't see any reason why you couldn't put a bigger Drive in here I mean you can get m.2 ssds that are 8 terab but obviously pretty expensive maybe not the most cost- effective thing ever but it is an option you know what this has this pcie connection I wonder you could break this thing open and stick one of those little like adapter do hickeys in there and then put like a 30 tbte kokia drive that would be ridiculous I'm not recommending that but
it probably would work I don't I don't see why not right holy the floating Mount is $30 that's literally a piece of plastic with a magnet in it h that's why you just get the magnetic cable organizers from LTT store.com you could totally just magnet this to one of those wait is this magnetic hold on hold on it's not magnetic natively how does that out work then oh I know what it is this has a metal plate in the bottom and that thing is a magnet that's so cheeky I guess magnets cost money so that's probably
another way that they're trying to keep the cost down on this thing if you were to put the magnet in here they would have to spend a couple dollars on the magnet in here instead you buy it in the plate I guess that makes sense let's set it up oh it's not even ether lighting it just has a little blinky light why did they give us ether lighting maybe this is just the default now okay here let's see new devices hey there it is cloud Gateway Max tap to set up test internet
speeds hey look at that it is connected to a 2.5 gig Port I don't know how good the speed test server is but that is pretty close to 2.5 gig that's good while we wait for this to firm more update I'm just going to throw in a couple of the specs here it's a quad core arm cortex a53 at 1.5 GHz it's got 3 GB of RAM inside of here which is part of why it can handle all these different apps they don't list the storage capacity without the SSD installed so I'm not sure what that is I guess we can
probably see once it's on and it it's a max power consumption of about 16 Watts pretty effective in terms of the power drw it's lower than some of the other things like a dream machine which might have a Poe switch integrated so that is one downside of this so if you are looking to set up a full UniFi Network you're going to need a Poe switch or at least Poe injectors on anything that needs Poe power like an access point for Wi-Fi or security cameras this one does not provide it it is also only $200 and
they have some pretty cheap Poe switches so you could set up a pretty inexpensive ubiquity setup with this is the core oh my God the firmware update 20 seconds left come on this console has been set up and is ready to transfer oh so they added an option for your like remote hands and you're setting this up for somebody else once it's done updating and everything you just click and you enter their ubiquity account and it transfers the ownership which I'm not going to do right now on the website it
actually lists only one when but here I can can I click the second one oh maybe not so does look like confirmed you can have two active internet connections on this thing and failover or load balance between them which is pretty awesome it's disabled by default which makes sense you probably want to use those as ethernet ports and if you're a newbie having that already set up as a backup wi could be confusing otherwise this is basically a fully-fledged like a dream machine these
are all the different settings you can do you can run VPN on it you can use IDs and IPS you can actually have a third wi I just found out using the UniFi e backup if you wanted that much redundancy that's a lot the only thing I feel like is missing here is being able to set these up in Shadow mode and have failover on these so you could have a redundant 2.5 gig setup for 400 bucks that would be pretty nuts but doesn't appear to be an option let me plug in my laptop here let's get some juice going
off this machine here and if I go to here look at that 2.5 gig so if I go to like fast.com here yeah 2.5 gig look at that I mean there's going to be a tiny bit of overhead but generally speaking you're pretty much there and also I don't know how reliable I feel like fast.com is inconsistent for me this honestly seems a little slow and I'm not actually sure why it must just be that speed test is just being crappy I don't I don't have a better explanation cuz here fast.com we're clearly getting 2.5
gig look at those boys right there and we got the hi wow radical dude overall this thing seems pretty sick I don't know why the SSD tray is $20 oh yeah look at the little screen there's stuff on the screen oh does it automatically yo it automatically flips the screen this looks sick if you got 2.5 gig like I would totally buy this I wish it had Poe too to be able to run like one access point of one port with Poe would be pretty sick but for 200 bucks just buy a Poe and injector or buy an AP that comes
with the poe injector like U6 smesh those are great this thing's sick I like it get subscribe comment tell me what you think about it I think very cool thumbs up goodbye
