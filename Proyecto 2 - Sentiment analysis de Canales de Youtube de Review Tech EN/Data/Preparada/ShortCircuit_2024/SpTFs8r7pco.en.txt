unless you've been living under a rock the last couple years and if you were I wouldn't blame you you probably have noticed the absolute Monsoon tunami of mini computers that has flooded the market they're cheap they're small they can hide in places and I mean they're cute right but we're kind of getting to the point where I feel like we might be missing the plot a bit this is the mini form Adam man G7 PT it is a gaming mini computer I mean it's it's pretty small but this is
",000 that's like gaming laptop territory" I don't even know what to think about this anymore I mean it's huge here's here's the computer we got that right there oh it comes with a stand very cool this power brick is almost the same volume as some of their higher-end mini computers HDMI cable in the box like that and the power cable you might be wondering why is this thing so large and if you haven't guessed already it's because it has a dedicated graphics card in inside of it specifically the 7600
MXT from AMD which is paired with the 7945 HX processor inside of it so this is an AMD on AMD computer on the front USB type a combo mic audio jack and USB type c this little guy you click the button and presumably those LEDs changed to tell you what performance mode you're and that's cool we'll try that out in a little bit on the bottom power connector for the gargantuan power brick and on the back holy IO Batman on the back we've got DP 2.0 HDMI 2.1 type-c with display port alt mode 3 10 gig USB type
A's a 2.5 gig Lan and then discret headphone and mic Jacks curiously this guy on the front is not USB 4 or Thunderbolt and neither is this one so you can't hook up an egpu to this computer I mean it has a dedicated graphics card in it so that's not really like the plot if that's your plan probably buy like a um 790 Pro or 890 Pro which have USB 4 and hook an egpu up to that you're going to save yourself a bunch of money but if your plan was to buy this and then like upgrade in 6
months you're not going to be doing that maybe you could mod it with like an m.2 we'll see when we open it up but as is no egpu power button on the top there's a little hole there I'm imagining there is a reset I saw there was maybe another hole here I don't know what these holes are for one of these probably does reset I kind of wish this had 5 gig land like that other mini form we looked at recently that would have been cool stand okay oh Jesus okay I was worried that it didn't have
like see magnets how do they work okay yeah there we go how does the power oh it's right angle I see okay so you you stick the doohickey in the hole and then you do like a that and then you do like a that well that's pretty clean I like that I guess all that's left is like the design I have seen on the product photos that there's going to be something lighting up here I don't know what that is yet and on this side I it's like Spider-Man themed I guess it's all mesh here which is good for cooling you
can see the fans right there and then we got a grill on the front grill on the top can I take this off oh oh oh this is magnetic waa Okay so we've got the light panel thingies behind what is this asakusa what I recall from CES when they were showing me this is the intention is hey you can just take it out and then just have like a panel here or you know if you were like an Esports company or something you could just order custom panels and put them in there I'm put it back on there
without it I'm sorry animator dude I don't like your logo on the side of my gaming computer it's just going to be like red we'll have to see if it's RGB in a sec here that's pretty much it on the  on who it is RGB the block I kind of like the the just the squares it's like a like a dance party you know what this dance move's called this segue to our sponsor MSI they put the cool in back to school and this season MSI has you covered with deals on gaming laptops AI capable machines gaming handhelds and
more because nothing says back to school like gaming so check out the fully spec certified gamer cyborg 14 and the rest of msi's back to school sale at the link down below and elevate your Tech game this semester I figured out what the two holes on the front are these are microphones it's two sides I can see an OBS there's like discret right and left interesting okay the one on the top then must be reset it's got mediatech Wi-Fi 7 which is I mean I don't know I I don't
have any experience with this particular chipset but generally I would like to see Intel Wi-Fi 7 especially on a th000 device this one came configured with two 16 gig sticks of 5200 megat transfer per second ddr5 and then we've got our 7945 HX as we saw before we have a 1 tbte Kingston SSD gen 4x4 it's "$1,000 without anything installed so in" "this configuration it's 1,200 I think" "it's 1,200 right now which says early" bird pricing but Min form does this thing where they say like early bird
pricing and the pricing never increases it's in the quiet mode right now which I like the quiet mode it's quiet I like very nice somehow drawing 30  button fan immediately go bur okay yeah that makes sense it's got apparently quite the cooling setup which we'll see in a minute when I take it apart something about liquid metal many hate heat pipes and for some reason gold it's pretty loud in this this here mode why is it what's 80 degrees what the hell is this thing doing nothing
Windows update I swear to you sir stop end task oh that actually worked okay all righty let's just let's open a cin bench we'll do a little cin bench see how warm she gets CPU multicore it's in the the loud mode Hey look it's as fast as an M1 Ultra in cin bench CR actually it's faster technically on multicore oh yeah okay okay okay so throughout in the hot boy mode 70° C and 85 Watts on the CPU GPU is chilling around 50 interesting look at that so you can see down here during this run it
was telling the GPU that the most power it could use is like 8 to 15 watts and then now that we are screen capping on it again and not running a stupid CPU load it's saying that the GPU could use like 40 WTS and it's actually using like 17 Dynamic power balancing very cool steam knows the FPS AMD the driver for the graphics card apparently does not but I'm driving around cyberpunk 1080p medium preset with FSR turned off and we're reving around 100 FPS is drying 112 Watts from the GPU Ultra is probably
a bit optimistic one might say but let's try it does this have R tracing on no cuz this doesn't doesn't do that right okay we're  now 80 FPS did they optimize this game that's pretty good Ultra between 70 and 80 FPS at 1080p no FSR oh let's look at the temps oh she was getting toasty almost 90° drawing 80 Watts on the CPU it was telling it it could do 180 Watts but it was actually doing 115 and the GPU is 70° so combined we're looking at like 200 W power draw in cyberone overall I mean it games It
games pretty good not as fast as Intel Wi-Fi but this is what you get with an AMD computer they're usually not going to put an Intel chipset with an AMD CPU upload speed it's just like across the board slower like this would be like 600 and 800 or 700 and it's just less good not scientific who knows maybe this AP is super overloaded but let's take it apart one thing I did find out these led panels they change colors every 2 seconds it's not configurable yet which is kind of lame
you can't change the speed I don't know if you can change the color but it's not an app it's like in the Bios H I wonder how this thing comes apart oh oh look at that Grill comes off cool now it looks way cooler all of the sudden even why why is it Spider-Man  web oh yeah okay that did something that sounded crunchy okay there's nothing attached to that that's good is it just no that huh what the holy heat sink Batman what the hell so does this just peel off oh  wrong yeah that oh we can put that back
is oh that's a fair bit of heat sink there brother so this entire section here heat sink more heat sink two big old blower fans I wish I could see more of this cooling thing I don't really want to take it off cuz it's liquid metal but um where do the ssds go if you buy this thing Bare Bones you got to be able to get in there I don't think they're on this they must be on the other side maybe it is just these panels just come out like super easy and I'm just overthinking it you know there
probably is a universe in which this  manual okay okay yeah yeah yeah that's not too bad oh there it is look at all that stuff in there okay so there's two little cables for this doohickey with the panel yeah don't take the thing I took off off just leave that side alone leave this guy on just take these off two little screws that was very easy to get in here we got our RAM sticks what is this guy this is like a cooler for  ssds wait we can see under the little m.2 cooler thing that it has two m.2
slots one of which is PCI gen 4x4 and the other is PC Gen 5 which they say is oh it's the first Mini PC with PC Gen 5 m do2s that's cool the the one that they shipped in this system which is not the Bare Bones one this one TB which is what you would get if you bought the thing is Gen 4 so keep that in mind this heat sink on the back here goes all the way up to here like this and then that fan you can see it right here just a little bit extra Fage to do a little more extra
Cooling and then you have the little fan for the m2s you can see our little mediatech thing if you bought this and you're sad about the mediatech chip you could just swap it with an Intel one oh good and the seos battery is on the  side oh look that's stuck right back on there like nothing happened man what do I say about this I "mean at the price 1,000 us to buy a" barebones or 12200 with 32 gigs of RAM 1 TB SSD it's not cheap you're not going to find these specs in a laptop probably
for less but mind you laptops also come with a keyboard and a screen and a battery and other things that are useful for doing stuff it's not super quiet unless you put it in the quiet mode but it's also not super horribly loud if you just want performance like you're going to be better off building a "gaming computer for $1,000 us you get" way better performance than this but you're probably not buying this for that use case as a little home theater PC like if you're in the market for a
computer that is this size it seems like a decent option if I'm looking for something to compare to that b model Rog knok which is a very similar form factor much slower CPU bit better GPU half the ram half the SSD is "$1,629 if you go to the top tier model" which still has a slower CPU although quite a bit faster graphics card same "storage and memory that's $2,200 so" "$1,000 more than this if this is the" form Factory you want I mean minis form they they're swinging and maybe hitting
if you are the ball that is for this so thanks for watching if you like this video like down below get subscribed tell me what you think about this this thick brick
