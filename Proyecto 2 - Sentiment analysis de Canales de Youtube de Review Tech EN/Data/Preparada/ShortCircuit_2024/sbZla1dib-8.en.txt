thumm is nothing new they make these adorable somehow fully functioning Electronics like this portable display and this little game console but what is new is the thumm color and I got to say right out of the gate I love this thing I mean the design reminds me of what's the one the G Game Gear right VA he wants to correct me so bad it looks just like the Game Boy Advance which okay uh thumm Advance maybe would have been a better name it doesn't matter the point is it's got a brand new processor in
here this is the new Raspberry Pi RP 2350 processor it is clocked today whopping 150 million Hertz with two cores and has 520 kiloby of SRAM along with 16 million bytes of storage which is just another way of saying that it's yeah pretty basic but oh my goodness look how tiny and cute it is and there's a lot more going on here that might not immediately meet the eye for one thing USBC charging man you got to love that you can't take it for granted on Tiny devices because
the USBC Port does take up a bit more space than a micro b there is apparently a rumble motor in here we've got a B d-pad functioning shoulder buttons as well as whatever that is and oh an onoff switch no way that actually looks really good the display may be tiny but it's also Mighty this is a 128 by 128 color display and it comes pre-loaded with wow look at these classic games we've got four Connect not to be confused with Connect 4 I mean that would be that would be a trademark violation wait what is
that listen at this I mean of course it has a speaker but I just I don't know I didn't really think about it it's so small it uses a magnetic Buzz speaker we'll get to playing games in a second first I want to see the rest of the games chess Monstra puzzle attack and sand wow solitire wow son of moris how are there so many games on here thumb atro the sequel to thumbon I'm going to try some of these in a minute but first I got to tell you about our sponsor hem are you tired of ugly shaky amateur-looking
phone videos that ruin your memories well the I steady V3 is a compact gimbal with a built-in tripod detachable remote and a 205 mm extension rod for added versatility its AI tracking and 3axis stabilization keeps things in focus and with the v3's upgraded fill light you can get creative anytime anywhere so whether you're a full-time blogger or you just want some help capturing those special moments pick up the I study V3 using our link below and make filming on your phone a whole lot easier screen's
actually it's not anti glare or anything but it's very usable now on the production model the sound will be adjustable but I'm apparently stuck with whatever volume I get so oh my gosh it's going so fast this isn't like casual dude I would say that I could be a little more accurate if I could get a little closer to it is that red I can't even tell I can't even see come on no get in there I'm dead already what the heck I mean In fairness to them I guess if you've got like six games you
don't want them to be too easy because then you're going to get tired of them pretty quick but that was really hard oh yeah sorry I'm supposed to talk about buttonfield uh honestly about as good as you would expect like they're obviously micro switches right you're only going to get so much feel to them but it's usable let's try a different style of game I don't know what monra is but we're going to play it we're going to play some Monstra whoa what I'm Bart Simpson I'm going to fight a gorilla what the
what the heck just happened oh no no no I got him he's only got three hearts left he's got nothing he's trash  win that's it no award ceremony oh I tamed the bear he's so cute look at his big shiny eyes you know what's kind of missing where's the little hang Loop how am I supposed to keep this on my keychain you know we never really got the perspective shot actually this is this is wild this is in a child's hands look at that standard AA battery like boom same length oh you can put other
games okay that's pretty cool so that USBC ports not just charging that's also data okay that's pretty sick by the way they anticipate about 2 hours of gameplay per charge which honestly so far with these games seems like lots Connect 4 you can play multiplayer Connect 4 with two thumms sorry for connect excuse me um can you play multiplayer of the other games like what about solitire can you play multiplayer solitire boom got him oh my goodness that is wow uhhuh wow that boy is that ever
something I don't know about soliter but I do like the idea of being able to load other games onto here oh I've been playing all the and more games maybe I should have tried the ones that they actually highlight yeah it's never you know it's never a good sign when you're the and mo it's like our special guest a name name and more and your and more it's not yeah it's not  Morris whoa look at this go that's like 2D Graphics okay I am throwing magazines like they're flyers I guess I'm throwing
I'm throwing Flyers can I destroy a car no I just have to dodge the car I think whoa whoa I can fly all right oh display density not that bad size yeah could be a little bigger could be a little bigger you know I think my last question is how much is this thing because if it's like 15 20 bucks then I think there's a pretty compelling value on offer here especially if we get a library of like actual games 50 bucks now get it you got a battery you got a processor got some Ram got some buttons
and switches and display and all that I  but cute product very cool idea questionable to buy it subscribe to Short Circuit oh
