Google has been understandably taking a lot of flak for the value proposition of the pixel 8A I mean who would buy the value a series phone for $500 when the $700 pixel 8 is often on promo for anywhere from $50 to $100 off I mean it should be basically a no-brainer right but I think there's something that people have been overlooking here and that is that a this is still a really awesome phone in a lot of W that we're going to go over in the next little bit and B while the specs and the experience are
permanent pricing is fleeting as Google has demonstrated again and again and again so if Google regularly promos the pixel 8 you can pretty much count on them to regularly promo the 8A so let's have a look at what the actual differences are between these phones starting on the outside the biggest difference is going to be the camera where the pixel 8A inherits exactly the same camera Hardware that we saw in the pixel 7A so any difference that you're going to get in image quality is going
to be thanks to the tensor G3 processor rather than the older tensor G2 it's a 64 megapixel sensor so it's not like it's going to be taking super blurry images or anything like that and Google has added their latest processing tricks to it including support for real tone in video which is their attempt to better capture more diverse skin tones with that said there's only so much you can do in software and we did observe a noticeable difference in quality especially in video compared to the
pixel 8 though if you're not comparing them side by side it's not like anything jumped off the screen at us as a problem with respect to white balance uh color reproduction or even the basics like the responsiveness of the shutter button which wow is really fast which probably thanks to the fact that it has almost the same internal Hardware as the pixel 8 but we'll get to that in a moment first you're going to get all the latest AI features like best take magic editor and audio Magic Eraser and the screen
that you'll be viewing it on is vastly upgraded over the older pixel 7A we actually love this screen the only obvious downgrade compared to the pixel 8 is that it uses Corning Gorilla Glass 3 rather than Corning victus other than that the peak brightness both theoretical and what we actually measured is up in the neighborhood of "2,000 flipping nits making for an" excellent HDR viewing experience the pixel count is identical so you're not losing any sharpness and compared to the
7 a we go from 90 HZ to a maximum of 120 HZ on the Adaptive refresh rate display I'd say the only really noticeable thing is that it does have thicker bezels but hey depending on you know how you hold your phone that might actually be a feature rather than a bug speaking of holding the devices I recognize that most of you are going to put a case or at the very least a skin on your phone but as someone who generally goes bearback sometimes at Great cost I actually found the matte finish on the
a series more pleasing to the touch than the glossy finish on the regular eight and I definitely do not miss that gigantic camera bump it's not that I can't get the eight into my pocket it's just that you know who likes speed bumps maybe children so they don't die okay okay generally I'm Pro speed bumps just not on my phone all right on the subject of speed bumps though we observed a difference in performance performance between these two devices in spite of them having on
paper the same specs we'll get into that in a little bit more detail later but first let's finish up the exterior tour at the top we've got noise cancelling microphones on both but not on the rear that's right compared to the pixel 8 the pixel 8A has only two microphones rather than three on the left side we've got these SIM tray on the right side we've got the power button which can be used to summon Gemini now including ooh Gemini Nano which can run some machine learning models locally on the device
for things like memo taking which is a welcome addition we've got the volume rocker over here and then finally at the bottom our USBC Port that handles charging ah but at different rates while the pixel 8 will do 27 Watts with a wire and up to 12 Watts wirelessly the 8A will only do 18 watts and 7 1/2 Watts respectively and features no support for wireless power sharing which is one of those features that seemed kind of Superfluous to me until long story short my wife lost her purse my phone was dead
I needed it to communicate with someone at the same time that she needed her phone because we needed to get to a Tracker something something I needed Wireless power sharing and it saved Our Lives well her purse is life anyway the last big difference externally is one that you won't see instead of having ip68 water and dust resistance the 8A has IP67 which under most circumstances probably won't make a difference to your day-to-day use but could be the difference between being submerged for
an extended period of time and dying or not dying but probably not did we ever open the box oh you get a sim removal tool a c Toc cable and a c TOA adapter no power brick because hey you know what go buy your own power brick let's talk about the insides both of them feature Google's tensor G3 processor 8 gigs of RAM and a minimum of 128 gigs of storage new with the 8A is the option to go up to 256 gigs of storage making this for people who take a lot of pictures and record a lot of video a far more viable
option than a series phones in the past and the best part is unlike Apple they're charging a reasonable price for that storage upgrade just $60 at MSRP which as we know Google is a little flexible about there are a couple of other downgrades on the spec sheet but these might not be as bad as they seem for one thing we go from Wi-Fi 7 down to Wi-Fi 6E yeah your download speeds could be slower on an 8A versus an 8 but it's worth noting that in the real world things like DNS lookups are likely to
contribute more to your page loading speed than the maximum throughput that you can get over the air the other one is that the battery is slightly smaller but this is where things get very very interesting because in our endurance test the pixel 8A actually outperformed the pixel 8 with its bigger battery and we'll get to that after this message from our sponsor dbrand all right dbr has something special for you today the Humane pin put it on oh good they put a skin on it here are some questions ask a
pen just put a finger on the pad and ask the questions D br's giving you how tall is lonus G Sebastian lonus Gabriel Sebastian is approximately 5' 6 in the average height of an adult male is roughly 5 5T 9 in do women prefer taller men heterosexual women are generally attracted to tall men due to evolutionary biological and social reasons why do I put up with this toxic relationship this question is not related to AIP pin and the rest of them are blank thank you very much dbrand go
to I assume short.com would be the vanity URL I guess you can buy debrand stuff there or you could just not that's also an option now to get back to what matters Genji impact right they're obviously both logged into the lab's account so we can't play on both phones at the same time but that's fine it doesn't matter the difference in performance was very small anyway with both phones managing in the neighborhood of around 40 to 45 frames per second average but they weren't quite the same
we observed that the 8A ran about 1.3 de hotter on the skin of the device versus the eight and ran about 2% lower both in terms of averages and 1% lows this could be related to the different thermal Solutions in these phones but while Google hasn't confirmed this we believe that it may come down to slight differences in clock speed because it's not just in genin Impact that we're observing these differences in performance in for example our endurance test which involves playing back a
YouTube video at a locked 250 nits for as long as possible we got an entire extra hour of battery life out of the 8A compared to the eight and the best way to explain this would be if the processor were running at a lower clock speed overall it's not a difference that we observed in day-to-day interaction with the device it's extremely Snappy I mean especially now that it runs at 120 htz just like the higher-end devices but if it's going to get me a little bit of extra battery life honestly I'm kind of
into it curiously on the subject of the battery we found that both the 8 and the 8A charged in the same amount of time time and what we determined is that this came down to the cable that we were using because both were using a 30 W charger which is well above the capabilities of both devices and it turns out that Google includes only a 3 amp rated cable with both of these devices so if you want to actually take advantage of the superior charging rates of the eight you have to go and Source
yourself a third party cable a minor detail but one that could matter to you now it's time for everyone's favorite   sound not the loudest thing and there is some a little bit of audible crackling and Distortion at the upper range of its capabilities but when you compare this to $500 phones from years ago pretty decent sounding speaking of the biggest benefit of the 8A is one that we have haven't talked about yet that isn't visible and that you won't find even in the software menus and that is software
support just like the rest of the 8 family the pixel 8A is getting 7 years of software updates and that's not just security I'm talking full OS upgrades and even feature drops now we've obviously seen that Google hasn't necessarily brought all of the latest features to their older devices the 7A is still lagging behind for example even in AI features that are processed in the cloud rather than directly on the device but it's clear that Google is finally addressing the competitive disadvantage
they've had against apple whose users are able to just take for granted that they buy an iPhone and they can probably use it until they are totally sick of the thing or Until It Breaks so the value proposition with the 8A here is pretty compelling and I can definitely see some users looking at the pixel 8 on promo and going well I mean come on for a of only $150 or even $100 yeah I'll take the better camera the better IP water resistance uh Wi-Fi 7 the faster charging if I go and Source my own cable
there's a lot of value here but depending on promos that difference could be more like the MSRP difference of $200 and you got to remember that especially in North America a lot of consumers are buying phones on contract and if that subsidy is fixed you know let's say a $300 or $400 subsidy you could be looking at a different price of $100 or $250 $300 so it's not necessarily a 20 to 30% difference in price it could be a lot more and there could be a lot more of this video but I
think I'm kind of done subscribe to Short Circuit
