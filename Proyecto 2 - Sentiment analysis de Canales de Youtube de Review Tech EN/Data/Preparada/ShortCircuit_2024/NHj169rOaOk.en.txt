woo this is the light base 900 and it's accompanying 600 and if you've noticed it has a bit of a party trick which sponsored by be quiet today we're going to check out as you can see horizontal Mount this right off the bat I don't know why more people haven't done this because it makes perfect sense every computer case on the bloody planet has a blank back panel let me just put the thing on its side right but it goes so much deeper because watch this I want to put it back up top I can do that pop the
feet out they just twist out like this easy now watch this that's a big girl it's inverted at least to a normal  this standard layout it's honestly kind of brilliant the design if you think about it it's it might seem a little confusing at first you've probably seen cases that have functionality like this even from be quiet themselves but those designs required taking out like 40 screws and moving the whole motherboard tray around flipping everything around they just made the case symmetrical top
and bottom so that all you need to move is the feet and you can invert or lay this case horizontally from whatever configuration you had before in a matter of like 30 seconds I just showed you how it's literally that easy they told me if if you turn it on and off oh look at that hey there's like a little orange animation because be quiet that's their brand color very cool this is the 900 the full fat full siize version it supports ehx motherboards it comes with four fans it's got this super sick RGB
bar that runs like I said before top and bottom all the way around it's a dressable RGB you can control it with the integrated fan controller and RGB controller or if you have a motherboard in it which this one obviously not right now you can hold the button and it'll revert to a motherboard control mode which as you can see right now has nothing so if you hold it down for a few seconds again it goes back into the manual control this very nicely integrated I like USB type-c 20 gig two
type a 5 gig ports combo audio a reset button which is something we're not seeing so much these days but they wanted it to be symmetrical and a big old power button but the keyy among you might have noticed something a little bit interesting about those fans I mentioned earlier huh they have reverse blades which solves a problem on pretty much all of those fancy crazy PC builds with like a bajillion RGB fans you might have noticed that to get the nice look they have to be oriented all blowing out
which is not good for cooling and really not good for dust be quiet has solved that problem these fans blow this way even though they look like they blow this way because the blades are reversed that way you can have the nice look of the front of the fan and have your airf flow pattern actually make sense now I have asked them they're not optimized for static pressure and they are technically a tiny bit lower air flow but as just case airflow fans they still work great and the biggest concern for
them was making sure the noise was low as you can probably guess by be quiet's name they don't like loud computers and it looks like they've achieved that I mean this is the about the loudest possible environment I could be in but I don't hear the fans at all and they look great let me show you what that looks like see fans everywhere and holy there's actually air moving through the bloody case it's brilliant naturally if you want to run an AIO in a system like this like so many people do they look
pretty you're going to want to run their normal lightwing fans which actually have good static pressure like these ones up here and you might have noticed this is a new aiio as well their current models have the pump up in the tubes this one they've moved it into the Hub here it integrates the offset mount for ryzen CPUs to get a few degrees off there and just looks nice and clean it's all addressable RGB this is what your computer could look like it's kind of cool actually with the vertical GPU
Mount it's actually kind of sick upside down it's actually super easy to do the vertical Mount you basically just take this entire piece here unscrew it and spin it it doesn't take any weird adapters or anything like that at least on the 900 but there is also the 600 the 600 over here is basically the same case but just a little bit smaller while still maintaining most of the compatibility it goes from eatx to ATX so tiny bit smaller motherboard or they said they could probably fit an eatx
board in there it's got big AIO support the same front IO but with a little bit more affordable fans they're lightwing lxs but still four of them and these are also the reverse orientation like the other ones we showed you before it also can do a vertical GPU Mount it's a tiny bit different process but kind of just involves rotating the thing it also can fit big aaos it it kind of can fit whatever you want in either of them I'm going to show you the rear chamber in a second but you
can see the little covers it comes with if you're not using this side you can throw these in here just to make it look a little cleaner on the top they actually made them like stealthy you almost can't even see the spots that it notches into FK oopsies big old fan filter across the whole rear panel in the back you can see the astronomical amount of cable management space as you get with a dual chamber case we got a power supply Mount here they actually integrated these two little mounts here
to give your power supply a little bit more support even though it does have screws on the back like any other power supply Mount both of them come with two fan hubs with full support for addressable RGB so you only have to plug one thing into your motherboard and the rest of it runs off of that it's much easier to Cable manage they have two 2.5 in SSD mounts on the little Cable Management cover and you can mount a 3.5 in hard drive if you'd like up here you can also expand this to two 3.5 in hard
drives or 4 2 and 1/2 in with an optional bracket you can see there's our airflow and our fancy fans that blow the correct orientation this is the intake side oh I you actually see how the little fan strips connect I like that it's accessible because if you wanted to replace one serviceable it's not all like glued down and impossible to get it you can just unplug it right there nice oh I almost forgot did you notice how this motherboard has no cables it's a back to front or reverse
CA motherboard which these cases holy support see look at all the on the back if you're not into AO coolers be quiet of course has a massive selection of air coolers and they all fit even in the 600 you can see this guy right here their biggest air cooler fits quite nicely I believe it's 170 mil CPU Cooler clearance on the 600 and something like 180 or 185 on the 900 and of course you can fit ginormous graphics cards like the rear of a computer case it's not really any different despite the ability
to invert it and you can see the Symmetry right here which is what enables that functionality this could end up a little bit different if you're doing a vertical Mount you just kind of flip this doohickey around but other than that basically the same power supply motherboard the included exhaust fan they're also going to be selling both cases without fans if you want to save a buck or use your own weird fan configuration maybe you have your own already they're targeting around $230
for the 900 with all four lightwing fancy fans and for the 600 closer to around 180 190 bucks with all the fans if you don't want fans to duct around 30 50 bucks then you're pretty much there regardless of whatever configuration you're going for air cooled AIO high power low power be quiet has some products for you so check them out at the link down in the description and thanks again for sponsoring this video of compex 2024 get subscribed like the video buy a power supply or a case or an AIO bye
