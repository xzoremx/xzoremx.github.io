in theory I'm the target market for this product I'm supposed to be transported back to a time in my teenage years when having a Nokia 3210 would have made me the Envy of all the call girls and drug dealers at my high school and in theory there's a lot to like here if what you're after is the durability and Battery longevity of these classic phones but with some Modern Creature Comforts like say not having to carry around a proprietary charging brick it's got USBC charging 3 1/2 mm Jack so you can play
your music Tunes uh integrated camera how many megapixels two megapixels does have a flash and of course the convenience of T9 texting o heyy look at that oh I guess it's going to need a battery first you might be wondering who hmd is Nokia is one of those kind of zombie Brands where theoretically the trademark is still owned by Nokia corporation but the brand has been liced by another company kind of like how you might see something from RCA on the Shelf dude RCA in its original form
hasn't existed in a very very long time in terms of included accessories this is pretty much it USBC charger um H yep I won't be able to use that one but you might rechargeable 5 1/2 W hour lithium ion battery ooh does it have a micro SD slot it totally does and dual SIM capabilities how does this thing have features that my flagship device doesn't what's the cost on this $95 all right Sims in hey wow what a big panel Gap that is several full millimeters between the front glass and the display panel itself
of course that's how you get durability  this right okay no service let's give let's give it a second here while we wait why don't I tell you about our sponsor dbrand oh God uh dbrand doesn't sell anything for this phone and didn't send us anything they just had to like throw stuff at you oh why why with the feathers why with the feathers where could they buy good skin no blur the sensor that sensor that all right go get a dbrand skin they're available for video game consoles phones
controllers laptops all kinds of devices in a variety of styles quality no residue we'll have them linked down below why did we do this cuz they pay us so far I've found support for MMS messages you can tell it to receive them automatically or prompt you to receive them which can be nice if you're roaming notifications yeah I mean that's it messages calls and voicemail I wasn't able to get an internet connection maybe because it's not actually available in North America wow well that looks
terrible if the original 3210 had a camera that would probably be it okay let's try a video yo what's up I'm just  3210 this really does remind me of my very first little like portable video recording device that I had as a child probably had similar specs 64 MB of ram 128 megab of internal storage on this bad boy and a uniso t107 s so I guess it's unit so I don't know but it does support Facebook just through a browser and that is not working on our device but ooh snake wait
what this isn't what snake looks like if you're going to have snake you should just have original snake you know what I don't mind the d-pad d-pad feels all right you can go off the edge are you messing with me you're messing with me there's no way I'm not trying it I'm  no no way you can go off the edge that's so stupid look how easily I can get out of this box stupid oh I guess I'll just easily get out of the box  radio can confirm that is in fact what listening to music was like insert
headset to get better performance ah that's right it uses your headphone wire as an antenna okay hold on that's a feature not a bug why it gives you a warning about listening at high volume levels and then literally cranks it to 9 when you open the app I'm pretty sure it wasn't at 9 before I plugged in the headphones remarkably bad yeah this is a dude this is a mess if lonus Media Group ever reaches the point where we're willing to license our brand to shovelware producing companies like this
to just you know profit off of I mean it can't even be that much profit let the company die you know just put it out of its misery all right I need to make a phone call because realistically everything I've said so far kind of irrelevant right what it comes down to is how good of a phone is it hi lady I'm just calling you from this phone that I'm trying out wow you know you know what it supports VTE and the call Quality actually pretty good hold on can I put you in speaker
no no that was a legitimate question I'm not sure if I can put you on speaker one moment oh yeah there we go yeah you're you're on speaker you're on speaker can you talk to me because for I didn't realize that you put me on speaker just based on me hearing your voice like it sounded pretty consistent there's a lot of sibling a little bit now though yeah a lot of lot of siblin in the uh in the speaker but it's it's loud it's pretty clear as a phone not bad but what about text no it doesn't have predictive T9
if this doesn't have predictive T9 that is actually trash okay so you go in the settings okay then you hit the gear then you get the option for predicted yeah because that's a sensible place to put that does he still got it does he still wait what is that okay I'm pretty slow this is the lowest effort soundtrack ever literally ever   you couple specs that I didn't cover they claim up to 9.8 hours of talk time and multi-day standby time uh it has no Wi-fi which is freaking hilarious and
considering you can get like a used iPhone for not much more than like 150 bucks like find an accountabil budy get them to set it up as like a kid device and lock down all the apps for you or something like if you can't trust yourself at least you'll have a camera that's worth taking pictures with subscribe to Short Circuit see you later
