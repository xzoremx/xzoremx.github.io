I've got a bit of a size problem my Bluetooth speaker is only about 3 and 1/2 in so I got a new one to compensate the Sony alt Tower 10 this is the bigger brother to the last one I had a look at the Sony XV 900 we're going to see if this one's bigger better it's more expensive it's about another $300 compared to the last one but I don't know this one's got more RGB bigger speakers maybe certainly weighs more I'll tell you that oh it comes in a box looks like we've got some packing
material here W they used paper except for all of this like Styrofoam and plastic that's sort of nice at least they at least they tried power cable we've got a quick start guide with like stuff unlike the last one this is not battery powered but it's got some more interesting features got an optical cable you can kind of use this the same as the last one to connect your TV I think we've got yeah some batteries too and they're Sony I didn't know they make batteries uh I did actually and warranty
instructions how to take it out of the box and the last one here which is kind of cool is it comes with its very own wireless microphone look at that I think this is being build as like an all-in-one karaoke machine you know you hook it up to the TV you have your lyrics comes with a wireless mic that's pretty sick I'm into that I don't do karaoke but yay yeah that feels like 63 pounds to me most of that seems to be the Box though bye okay let's see if I can lift this up 
good microplastics as if I needed more of those in my bloody lungs chase a little bit bigger than the last one oh man that is that is impressive look at that Bell wow the first thing I kind of noticed is it's got speakers all around it similar to the other one we got two in the front we got two in this like mid driver thing we got a j out we got a gigantic square one here static electricity and another two down here at the bottom if we spin her around this way we've got another two at the top
here we've got probably what looks like another two here they' got some foam on them they're kind of strange honestly uh this is all hard plastic and then and I think that's about it so 360Â° sound is like I don't know just a couple extra speakers probably doesn't need it though it's got some nice Wheels let's have a look at the bottom while we're down here yeah it's got wheels some rubber pads which is always good cuz this thing is uh a little bit large big power button on top and an ALT
button we'll see what those do it's probably got uh yeah I can sort of see the inclination of little touch buttons here but of course the touch surface is piano black so the whole thing's just going to be covered in fingerprints which is great just give me physical buttons please please apparently the top of this is Splash proof so if people put drinks on it or they're drunk and they get some stuff on it I guess that's good maybe that's why they didn't put physical buttons on it we've also got
this rubberized thing here which flips up and it's really nice it's magnetized down onto that surface which is kind of cool we have a mic or guitar input uh level for that and I wonder if this little slot here is for like music or like a stand or something I don't know maybe it's for the microphone I don't like see a place to put the microphone oh hold on oh that's nice and look there's one on each side there like a cup holder for audio things last thing on this seems to be some more ports at
the back there we are let's see what we got we got a USB port we've got our Optical in and we have a audio in as well the USB Port can charge and you can use it for playing as well although I'm not sure where you can put your oh okay maybe that's what this is for you could stick your phone in there like that last thing we have down here is the power input and unlike the little brother it doesn't have a built-in battery unfortunately but I think that's fine for how big this thing is last I guess

microplastics uh looks like we've got a bunch of colors on the top now we've got red and a different type of red and gray and GR gray and purple not color blend I'm just kidding and yeah we can turn the light on and off and whatever multicolor is I guess that's RGB puke mode which is always fun uh what else we got we got Bluetooth button audio in USB play start stop all that sort of stuff and yeah it's got Optical in so you can use this as a base booster for your TV the other one kind of worked the same
but it didn't sound very good and was just basically based and I understand that this one is exactly the same and then the giant alt button oh that was scary that was not a good sound that was a oh God I don't know Bell and this is definitely built as a karaoke machine so we have key control on the top you can bring it up or down probably a semitone at a time and let's put some music in it I've got the short circuit phone here which seems to not be an iPhone anymore for some
reason alt Tower 10 it's picked it up   done I thought I heard some crackling from this speaker but maybe I don't know it's got to get broken in or whatever and for the record that was about half volume no way actually quarter volume so that's uh you guys got ear protection I'm actually scared this is a lot louder than the other one and the clarity seems to be better too the alt button seems to be sound profiles so it makes different noises which kind of indicate I think
what its profile is this is obviously the loudest most altest most bumping one but the other two seem to be a little softer or a little less treble and a little more midi that kind of thing I don't know how many it has we will check in the manual I brought out the spec rectangle and it looks like we're drawing about 140 Watts from the wall each channel is rated for 20 watts and that's measured in RMS which which is pretty good okay you ready for this guys mhm no you're  
450 ow Fu what that's good no Distortion at all anywhere um I think that crackly speaker was maybe just it oh I'm being used now so that's that's good that was very intense yeah okay this will piss your neighbors off um and it might kill small children okay we can't say that keep your pets away otherwise that'll be a bad time this seems to be very similar to the last one as well we have it in the Sony music app and it's got all the sorts of the settings and things um one
thing that I do notice is the group with other speakers is kind of great I love to see that so you can get two of these and group them in Stereo or you can put them anywhere and like murder people in the middle of the room with sound feable is the LED app thing which you can make it do stuff we can adjust the audio in I guess uh whoop USB we can switch to that it does it automatically here uh seems to have automatic YouTube music which is interesting welcome short circuit hello
and now we've got our settings sound so we have alt two okay that low bump is off alt one alt two which I think has more high band maybe and then off so what are these enhances the deeper low pass sense of increased power what does that mean could mean a bunch of stuff it just sounded louder the last mode we have is custom which you can set a custom EQ on it's got a few bands and it's not super exciting but you know whatever DJ effect oh yeah we had this last time as well
with the like isolator and flanger which was bad what else we got illumination lighting mode oh these are fun we got light off this one's called delightful ha Rave yeah that's exciting that's woo chill which is a little bit more exciting than Rave I guess with strobe I assume that it'll kind of go through it it's not particularly settings deep but I mean this is more of a centerpiece for karaoke I believe than anything else I'm going to go ahead and listen to some music that I know and uh yeah see you in
a minute  that's pretty good what what ohoo that was very loud sorry everyone uh this thing on I was I was I was on my way sorry uh we're all gathered here today let's have a listen to this yeah okay it's a microphone it's really near field like I got to get right up on it I that's pretty loud for you guys right and I'm talking right here as soon as  gone it's nice that it comes with a mic I guess that's cool uh and I think think it basically is plug-and play like I I just turned it on and it was
connected immediately so yeah if you're going to be doing karaoke this is an all-in-one machine and I assume that by having the two holders uh you could have two people stereo music unfortunately it's only one wireless mic I guess this other one would be for a wired mic and then you could have two together or you could hang a guitar off of here don't do that I hate the piano black but you know whatever you gave me buttons for the power but they're all in piano black I don't know why everybody does this uh
the lights are cool sort of I mean it's got lights on it they react to the music charges the phone you can get hot chips on it the tweeters themselves are sort of protected which is great you can't get your fingers in there these guys yeah maybe I can see people sticking hot dogs in there I know I would as this is kind of is a portable speaker I mean you're going to have it plugged in it's 140 Watts which is a hell of a lot it's got a nice metal grate on the front but all of the sides
and everything is kind of this soft plastic it's kind of already there's something on my hands at the moment and if you're moving this around like it's going to get scratched up pretty bad uh the metal front is good though that feels nice and sturdy I can see Ever So slight Dent right in the center uh just punched it it's not where I punched it that's not where I punched it I punched it here I would say if you're in the market for a party speaker that you can take somewhere uh this is probably the
one to get it's a reasonably priced at "1,200 bucks it" performs like I would expect for that price point it's loud it's got features built in I don't know if you want this type of thing I would definitely buy it probably not for me but you host a lot of parties certainly outdoor events anything like that easy thank you so much for watching if you are in the market for one of these check out my other video that one is actually battery powered so maybe that's what you want in a
speaker okay boys with wheel me away maybe I don't know
