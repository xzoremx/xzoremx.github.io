according to nexo who sponsored this video their new Tri Vision Ultra portable projector uses AI to automatically Keystone automatically detect screens automatically align your image and even automatically detect if you are looking into its laser output in order to protect your eyes so I'll tell you what next too either your product is going to look real great by the end of this video or I'm not going to be able to tell the difference I'm going to try it the eye protection oh good
of course nobody's going to care about their perfectly aligned image and working eyes if the image isn't any good so it's a 4K projector it comes with a factory calibration report and they claim that in SDR it is able to achieve a Delta of less than one it supports Dolby vision and hdr10 and uses their Tri LED Laser Technology to achieve better color accuracy wider color gamut and greater brightness achieving 2600 lumens according to the spec sheet in the back we've got two the three HDMI
2.1 inputs one supporting EC one supporting game right it's got game actually apparently it really does it's rated at 4.2 milliseconds of input lag in game mode we've also got uh USB if you want to play your files or whatever else as well as 3 and half mm audio out spit if a network Jack and a third HDMI port nope not there I'll find it it is in there I was right I just need a screwdriver if only there was somewhere I could get a screwdriver wait I know Home Depot no LTT store
that's the one anyway there's a third HDMI 2.1 input in the bottom there's both oh that's cool you've got a little micro USB for power and then you've got an HDMI input for your fire stick this is a really smart way of delivering a smart display without saddling your customers with you know whatever random Android skin you happen to be using instead you can use whatever random Android skin Amazon happens to be using now I think it's time for for us to fire it uh H this feels like there's more stuff
in here but I see foam at the bottom ah foam and power cable and also dang it what is in here that's so heavy what is this good Lord wow a 300 wat power brick okay I guess that's how they get the light output with the power brick curiously there's no link to Netflix or Disney Plus or prime or anything like that so what are the Vegas odds on me losing my vision in the next 5 minutes here I guess you'll just be chief officer chief officer have you talked about the weight yet I'm doing my best
these things take time oh the weight I get it uh yeah it's pretty light 11.46 lbs wow yep that feels like 11.46 lbs all right great here we go let's plug it in it's a bit of a hack though because the power brick probably weighs another 3 PB a damn it okay I need a longer power course this is the thing about every projector set set up it's super elegant until you need to power the projector but hey look if this thing's as impressive as it is on paper maybe it'll be worth it this is my companion brick
let's fire this bad boy up oh and we're probably also going to need a screen which it should detect let's see how that goes oh I meant to mention the speakers earlier dual 15 watt speakers they've actually got a little bit of Rumble now it doesn't have a qu2 mount but no feet so you're going to be using books there we go oh you got a light stand oh that'll do perfect this will help us at least make sure that the screen is within the bounds of what we  so no stop is a setting you can turn off
I'm going to turn off the automatic stuff for now I do still want to see if it'll work cuz normally I would have a little bit more Flex ility in terms of where I'm placing the thing oh crap I've ruined everything whole game over okay this is now a solvable problem because the size of the projected image is greater than the size of the screen let's see if it can dial it in here we go turn on the automatic everything speaking of have I mentioned the maximum screen size they say they support 150 
yeah the automatic screen detection  point all right there we go we got it down in hey we should probably turn off some light so we can actually see what this thing looks like image parameters let's go ooh actually let's do super bright first super bright wow make sure the vents aren't blocked make sure the temperature does not go above 77 F and do not turn the volume above 40% dang we in super bright mode okay let's not bother with that let's go with uh Vision night and let's turn some lights
off big shout out nexico here they've got their motion estimation motion compensation feature that's like highlighted on the box but is off by default thank you that's the correct setting for that it has a 24 FPS mode so it'll go into 24 FPS native which is pretty cool there's all the projector settings you would expect so you can have it rear mounted or ceiling mounted uh you can configure it so if you're aiming at a white wall it'll help compensate for that but what's cool is
that this is just a display menu it's not actually Smart in any way without that fire stick that we put in it before and I actually kind of prefer this approach it means it'll never be outdated I get a little bit of rainbow effect if I look at the lens off axis I shift my eyes around but I'm not picking it up on the screen I wonder why that is speaking of which do I have the eye protection thing on seeing how the screen detection and all of that worked I think my confidence
is a little lower but hey let's give it a shot is it going to turn off if I look at it automatic obstacle avoidance wait so what does obstacle avoidance mean like if there was a lamp or the light switch or something on the wall we try to avoid it oh interesting okay well we don't have that we have a screen because we are smart and if we're spending this much on a projector we should probably get at least a basic  works you broke it oh there you go nice at this price it doesn't need
any of the AI to impress me "it's 1,00 in their Early Access and it's" "1,00 once that's passed so if this even" remotely holds up to the kind of image quality that the specs say it should have uh it's going to be pretty compelling even though you do have to manually do the Keystone man it must be rough being a sponsor for this channel cuz you're like yeah man I'm just going to like sponsor an ad and then we're going to like test your features and if they're bad we're totally going to have
that in the video it is what it is but hey that's how you guys know that if we say something's good it's actually good so HDMI 3 Let's Go actually now that I've got some more white elements on screen I take back what I said before I can pick up the rainbow effect looking at the screen so if you're super sensitive to it then you will notice it on this not bad the blacks are not the deepest I've ever seen but it's got enough brightness that the perceived contrast is still quite High especially
at that early bird price this is a lot of image w we weren't even at 4K either so this should be quite a bit sharper man and we've even still got a fair bit of light in here 3D settings seriously it supports 3D hilarious for all y'all that are out there with your "3D projection setups 1,100 bucks hey and" it's a pretty painless setup you just plunk it on a thing well and then manually Keystone it you know Keystone used to be pretty much unusable because the light spill was so strong but on
these newer projectors where you can barely even perceive it even if you know what you're looking for it's pretty usable also the improved resolution helps right like when you were using Keystone on a 720p projector you were giving up a lot of the very limited resolution you had but now that it's 4K yeah you give up a little bit of resolution no big deal crab Rave let's go it's like I said before not the highest Clarity I've ever heard but it's actually got some kick to it which makes
sense when you look at the size of the drivers but was not expected given that most projectors have absolutely none let's play some games though can it hold up in games you can really see how much light spill there is in this room from even just the cracks in the windows cuz they can see the shadow of your camera arm thing on the screen so everything you're looking at then remember this is under suboptimal conditions for sure like this is really vibrant so we're plugged into HDMI 2
which is the like game port and let's just go down here oh look at that oh that's cool okay so before I was a little confused cuz it was grayed out I had wanted to like change it to HMI 2.1 but it only lets you select the highest version that is supported and then you can fall back to a lower version if you want that works exactly like I would hope okay so enable low latency is not on even though we're plugged into the game port but that's going to cost us 24p Cinema mode 3D mode and Keystone
correction not having Keystone could be a bummer wait Keystone is totally still  it Keystone 100% working now I'm pretty good at this game who's using this controller which game are you good at this one yeah really yeah cuz you've told me you're good at games before and I am were you good at the ones you told me you were good at uh editor pull that up I don't even remember how to pick a character well I'm blue okay I guess I'm pink got him uh okay standard match okay let's go oh no no I played this with a
PlayStation controller on the lwig stream the controls are different a w w oh no I'm going to get wrecked it's it's hard for me to tell cuz I okay hold on I'm going to stop using the analog stick use the analog stick come on man yeah why not a what is even happening right now big W's that's what's happening oh man I thought I was good at this game okay let's try something where I'm going to be a little more easily able to tell what the input lag is like it actually does not feel very good it didn't feel
good no no um so I need to I need to figure out if this is a settings issue okay we figured it out to get the super low latency mode working you need to be running in 1080P and 240 HZ now I don't think the PlayStation supports 240 HZ so we're hooking up a computer let's go okay now that I'm hooked up to a PC I think I figured out the latency thing it is much better in 240 HZ 1080p but it isn't 4.2 milliseconds nexo seems to be conflating the amount of time that each frame is being displayed with the input
leg which is not how that works it's okay but if you're playing games that require pixel perfect timing this is not the world's fastest gaming projector it's also not the world's most expensive gaming projector so with that in mind the compromises do make sense but Mexico needs to clean up that messaging on their site hey guys future line is here turns out we were right with low latency mode off and Keystone on the latency of this projector gets as high as 35 to 50 milliseconds depending on the operating
mode but with low latency on and Keystone off we saw it get as low as about 5 to 8 milliseconds so uh let's try that with Counter Strike oh yeah there you go okay yeah this feels great like awesome I mean I'm still not any good at games but yeah this is awesome this is like super low in conclusion thanks nexico for sponsoring this video of the tri Vision Ultra it really does offer a very interesting combination of features portability decent performance and especially at the early bird pricing a
very compelling value so you guys can find the link in the video description if you want to check it out
