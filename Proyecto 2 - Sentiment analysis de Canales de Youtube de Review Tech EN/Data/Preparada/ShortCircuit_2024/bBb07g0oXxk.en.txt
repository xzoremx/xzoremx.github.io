we all know Asus makes great monitors but what if I told you that they sent us the whole freaking kit and Kaboodle Asus sponsored this video so we could take a look at their Rog OLED Master kit which comes with a monitor arm a handy dandy light bar for those of you cultured folk who like to keep your desk nice and bright but finally the piece the resistance their PG 32 ucdm the 4K cutie OLED 32 in 240 HZ this thing is amazing and I want to make sure I open it without breaking
it it's a thing of beauty what have we got in the Box we've got the base of our stand I actually kind of like asus's stand this one is huge because it's a 32-in monitor but there you go that's why we've got the monitor arm you know what I'm not even I'm going to take this stuff out of the box but I'm not even going to use it today I might click clack the monitor but that's about it one thing I love about their stand is how Wild and secure their base the column base is like look how good this
is you just screw it in like the other ones but it's got that ring of support got our handy dandy power brick and then after that something that they've been doing for a while now uh that I really appreciate is their little kind of travel kit that has all of the cables and accessories in it I love it when companies do this fantex also does it with their cases they'll keep like an actual little box for all the screws and whatnot as for what we get in here usbb usba a cable the rest of our c113 power
cable three more cables this is too many cables you guys guys uh that's an HDMI 2.1 cable USBC cable because it does 65 WS power delivery 90 WS if you enable it in the menu OSD I don't know why they've got it as a feature that you have to turn on but it is what it is and then our handy display port cable probably just 1.4 that's okay what is this like a Vasa adapter or something oh this is probably for the base yeah this is for the base of the stand you just kind of like pop it down there boom just fits
real good I won't put it on for now then we've got oh my welcome to the elite republic of gaming and then stickers I will maybe keep the stickers what's this last thing though ah this is probably our vesa adapter not 100% sure they're typically kind of different for each monitor but that's my best guess looks like it pretty much lines up with this guy here and then it's beautiful and all I can see is the back but it's all clearly labeled we've got all of dcn HDMI HDMI display port
USB like everything is just nicely labeled very easy to read uh super thin panel with like a giant graphine heat sink and whatever else they've got in the control box it's a beautiful monitor I haven't turned it on yet but I kind of have the same panel at home and I can tell you right now it's really nice I changed my mind we are going to give it the old click clack there we go this thread here is for whatever you want to mount on top of this guy camera perhaps or even just a ring light for
example my monitor at home doesn't have that and so I've just got my webcam like mounted precariously on the top it looks ugly I can't just easily put a camera up here it sucks I love this thing it's pretty thin really nice we've got a bunch of stand adjustment oh height we can oh more and more people are going to the column swivel and I'm here for it feels more sturdy one other really nice feature about this before I talk about the I/O is it's flat for those of you who care so that means when
I put it down on our handy dandy desk pad I don't have to worry about putting it back in the box with the curved foam to make sure I don't put extra pressure on the panel or anything it's just good to go it's beautiful we've got DC power in two HDMI ports probably 2.1 display port 65 W power delivery it's labeled a 65 Watts here but you should be able to change it in the OSD usbb then we've got USB more USB a third USB spit if out and a headphone jack another nice feature that I haven't
noticed on other panels there's actually kind of handles on the side here I don't think they're meant to be used as handles but for instance I wanted to rotate this before I put it down and then check out our monitor arm and it was really easy to do that I'm always scared about moving these things because you know the panel's so flexible but not this time now for the part I'm most excited about I've been wanting to mount my monitor on an arm recently I did it to my other guy my ultra wide and the
other one's just kind of sitting on my desk taking up space I don't want that I want to put it on an arm make it look real nice so we've got their Ergo monitor arm the a01 and uh I don't know anything about it so let's open the box and see if it's any good we got this adapter plate it looks like everything is as branded Rog Republic of Gamers oh oh wow that's heavy oh my God they say it can hold up to a 39 in Monitor and I believe it cuz this thing is Hefty and if this is going
to be like the counterweight that's kind of sitting on there and clamping to my desk then uh yeah it's going to be able to take a quite the load here's the main arm it looks pretty sick actually I love the like giant red spring you can see in there I don't know what these uh 25Â° 729 3 North I don't know any of that means but it looks cool and I'm here for it and I kind of want this monitor arm now not going to lie all right let me get this assembled and we'll be right back all right it took a little bit of
finagling but it wasn't too bad you know we've got our monitor arm on our desk and look at all this range of motion we got it's so good and look at this we can go portrait if we want to we can go all the way upside down if we want to we're not going to do that at all but we could now though what I really want to see is this light bar because you know Andy loves his light bar I've seen it Tastefully used in a lot of other people's setups but I personally don't want a light bar at least not on top of
my monitor so I don't really get it but maybe today's the day maybe today they convert me Whoop I'm guessing think this is the light I don't know let's find out what this fancy secret thing is it's probably the mount it is that's not so secret oh I don't know why this is so entertaining it's got like the perfect amount of tension on a spring with a weight that's got some rubber on the end it's their patented clamp and magnetic Buckle so you spin the knob and then this clamp opens
up the other way and it closes wow okay it's pretty cool this is another thing where I'm actually going to have to look at the guide cuz uh never installed a light bar before they've got this nice little cut out there for your USBC cable so that you can power it pretty nifty will cable manage as to the best of our abilities it may not be super easy but we'll try now that we've got it plugged in we're just going to try to put it on here somewhere uh like this sure that seems like it's counter weting enough
I'm not super sold on the counterweight thing it's got a clamp system on it but the clamp is going to cover a ton of the screen and there's nothing back here that it could clamp onto but you know what as long as don't move your monitor all that much even if you do like this is fine it's not really going anywhere this looks okay but I can't really see the light from the light bar too much because of our studio lights Glenn can you uh C out the lights just for just for a moment okay we're in our Asus
display widget Center Software here to adjust our light bar however what I just found out is if you you know scrolling through here it's just changing like color temperature and then if I click it it's brightness pretty nifty click it again and it's color temp but we can change a whole lot right here these are the RGV settings it might be nice if you could make the you know front of the light blue or something like that but people don't want that I guess I do I'm not sure how sold I am on having a light
bar in general but being able to control it here is pretty nice being able to change like the color temperature and brightness of your screen light as well as the Aurora RGB on the back it's pretty handy being able to do it in one single place on my computer so I don't have to touch anything else I just keep my hand on the mouse and click click click away there's even an advanced setting that lets you customize it to use different lighting for different apps and browsers whether you're big on
light bars or not the anti-reflective coating on the glossy screen is actually doing a pretty good job you see it on and this reflection is getting diffused out quite nicely so it's a lot less distracting but what I want to know is how good are those 03 millisecond response times on OLED pixels well they're really good but we're going to try it let's play some good old CS2 oh I got to say it's there's a reason I bought a monitor similar to this as soon as they started launching like yeah once
you get up to like 360 Herz and higher OLED pixel response times are basically perfect especially with the new 480 HZ that's out this year but 240 with the instant pixel response time it's just so good 4K as well on a 32in screen it's like this is the monitor for me and then the cool thing is I'm not finding any terrorists but the cool thing is once you've got this kind of you know on an arm say you want to like kick back and relax you know watch some content you're good like this but then you want to get
into the Zone boom now we're gaming this is yeah I mean I lost but now I'm gaming no matter which OLED monitor you get in 2024 they're all beautiful like absolutely stunning however one little nice trick that this does that's it's not doing right now cuz this isn't Dolby Vision footage but it does have Dolby Vision so if you are going to watch some movies mastered for that content you can watch it on here and it's going to look great we did whole LTT on DV vers hdr10 plus
and while the difference isn't amazing it's not night and day people could tell let's talk about how it tested though when we tried it in user mode it was actually very color accurate in SDR we measured an average Delta e 2000 of just 1.06 with a Max of 2.13 super Super Color accurate out of the box as for HD color accuracy we measured a Delta ITP average of about 17.5 and a Max of about 38 40 that might seem a little high and it is but Delta ITP is a lot stricter than Delta e2000
and for HDR measurements we've been switching to that to try to give you a better picture then yep smaller numbers still getting a little smaller and finally for brightness we reached our "advertised 1,000 nits I think it was" like 990 8 sorry two nits off but it's just good I don't know how to explain it guys if you want a flat monitor then the PG 32 ucdm is probably for you it's just a beautiful beautiful device and uh I don't know maybe I'll feel some buyers regret when I go home today I'm not sure
all I know is this looks incredible and I can't wait to just go stare at it some more so this has been the Rog OLED Master kit you can get the monitor for "about 1,300 bucks the light bar is 170" and then the monitor arm is about $200 so overall if you want the whole package it's going to cost you a pretty penny but uh you know single piece meal maybe you just want the monitor maybe you just want the light bar maybe you just want the monitor arm I don't know but whatever you want we'll have it linked
in the description below thank you so much for watching thank you so much Asus for sponsoring this video and we'll see you guys in the next one bye now I just keep waving for a while
