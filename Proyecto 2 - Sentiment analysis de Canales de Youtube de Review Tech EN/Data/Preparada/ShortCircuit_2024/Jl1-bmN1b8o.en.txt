they told me the fun key s was the world's smallest foldable handheld console but I mean my wife says that my hands are perfectly normal size I mean  guys oh my goodness this thing is so cute the idea here is on the surface very simple it's to have a PlayStation 1 capable emulation machine that is so small that you could conceivably carry it around on your keychain but everything about the execution is absolutely incredible this thing is fully open source everything Hardware
software you can literally download design files and make your own fun KS if you really wanted to and it runs a distribution of Linux that is optimized for emulation and gaming to the point where they claim that you can freeze the state of whatever it is you're doing if you're in the middle of a game open it up and pick up exactly where you left off in about 5 seconds it's so cute I want to play games okay okay I I'll look at what's in the box first it's available in a bunch of different colors
obviously we went with atomic purple because everyone knows that's the best color and included in the Box you get yeah yeah micro USB cable yeah it's USB micro instead of USBC which is a bit of a downer but I also get it they needed to make this thing as small as freaking humanly possible and you get a variety of different colors of d-pad and buttons I love it cute little user manual in the shape of the fun key it shows you how to turn it on turn it off and shows you how to use the function
button so you can change the aspect ratio you can change the zoom you can adjust the volume and brightness and you can take a screenshot with function plus the shoulder buttons I can't believe that they squeezed shoulder buttons onto this you can bring up system stats transferring files is as simple as dragging and dropping them there's a Micro SD slot inside which supports cards up to 128 gigs and it comes pre-loaded with some royaltyfree games but I mean look at this thing obviously
if you were to copy paste some ROMs or isos over there it would uh it would know what to do with them speaking of copying things over we found the instructions not the most intuitive but system upgrades are also performed by dragging and dropping a file right right I won't play games yet right right we got to look at the io okay so on the back you can clearly see the 410 milliamp battery so at 3.7 volts what is that in wat hours I don't know I don't feel like doing the math the point is
it's a really small battery and people are claiming anywhere from 2 to 3 hours of battery life out of this thing it can be disassembled using two Phillips head screws revealing the arm cortex A7 processor at 1.2 GHz 64 megab of ddr2 o memory and an incredible 10 mm mono speaker but don't take my word for it I will be opening it up courtesy of that's right my friends finally the LTT Precision screwdriver that's right this video is brought to you by Creator Warehouse I've got talking points and
everything how professional we're launching the ultimate Precision multi-bit screwdriver it's built with an anodized aluminum handle with diamond etched nerling making it an absolute Delight to hold in the hand it's got a strong neodymium magnet at the tip that keeps your bits in place and holds on to your screws once you remove them oh yeah look at that holding my screw look at me in my bad self speaking of bits it's got internal storage for up to three bits the end cap is interchangeable that's
right my friends concave flat and convex tips and embedded within the cap is a hybrid ceramic ball bearing for the smoothest turning experience not to mention that it's a heck of a fidget toy you might have noticed that the shaft on them is a little bit longer so you can get into deeper devices a bit more easily than some other Precision drivers sign up at the link in the video description and you can be one of the first to get your hands on one of these we weren't going for the highest
performance here I'm actually kind of impressed that this thing runs PS1 games do I get to game now yes sir okay  okay not the world's most impressive speaker I got to say I'm pretty impressed with the display though what is this an inch 1.54 in but it's IPS look at that viewing angle you guys that's not bad you know what let's open up with Game Boy Color now apparently cover art does not populate on its own that's one current drawback of fun Kos but you can add it so these are these
appear to be home brew games let's see  not the world's most amazing speaker I have a witch hat oh pew pew a pew pew PE pew pew pew oh cool like Ste OS they've built in an overlay that can be accessed from within any game or application so getting back to the main menu is as simple as activating the overlay and boom look at that oh we got The Lion King nice now there's been some complaints about the aspect ratio of the screen in the community because it's this is one to one right almost no
screen is one by one and so if you're playing something like Game Boy Advance games you're going to end up with black bars on what is already an extremely small screen but you know what I say I say get out your reading glasses scaled is what I would want I've got really small black bars to match the original aspect ratio of the game yeah I noticed that there's a little bit of moare uh on the screen that is not visible in person it looks pristine oh no no no okay it's noticeably harder to play
on this than it would be on something bigger you know I don't know if it's input leg so much as it's just the travel of the buttons being noticeable on such a small thing you know not going to lie it's um not that easy to see what I'm doing am I just getting old I'm having a bit of trouble holding down the Y and also activating the jump button that was pretty tough guys not going to lie now let's check out the Save State functionality theoretically I just close it like that I open it up one 2 3
4 they claim 5 Seconds that looked like 5 Seconds to me and what's cool is again according to their claims if you run out of battery it'll do it automatically it'll just grab your Save State and deal with it for you dude I can't see a bloody thing like trying to play a fast-paced game at this side oh my goodness I can't I can't do this you know what I actually don't really have a ton of complaints about the performance it seems finish I've noticed a couple little slowdowns but not bad
and we did observe some errors in audio emulation while we were testing but it's hard to say whether that comes down to the anemic processor or whether that's down to the emulators themselves even with no competition though $73 for what is essentially a novelty item if that's the kind of money that you have that you can sort of throw disposable income at something like this but whether you're going to actually get a ton of gaming out of it hard to say I mean there's enck devices that are yeah they're
bigger but they're also a lot more ergonomic and a lot more enjoyable to use the funkey OS though is kind of a unique value ad very cool I'd honestly I mean it's open source right so it'll probably happen but I I'd like to see the OS on something that's a little more usable subscribe to Short Circuit
