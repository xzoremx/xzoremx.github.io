on paper this Samsung Galaxy book looks absolutely exceptional the only thing is though knowing Samsung they it up somehow let's figure out what it is open the computer press the power button that's what you need to do warranty don't care about that here we have 140 W charger which is all being delivered over USB type-c damn it that's not what I wanted to do oh there's the charging cable how long's the cable it is 6 ft one thing that is pretty concerning while we have it
flipped over like this is I don't see any screws so I suspect getting into this will be a pain all right so we've got the Samsung Galaxy Ultra Book 4 right here and my first impressions are that it's quite well built on the right we have a micro SD card reader USB type a headphone microphone combo Jack on the left hand side two Thunderbolt 4S and HDMI 2.1 I do really like how the Samsung logo is all rainbowy it's like RGB but without the power in the past my experience with Samsung laptops has been
that they have incredible screens and the rest kind of just sucks but right here this feels vastly improved we have an all metal chassis pushing on it it feels really great damn before we go any further there's one thing that I really need to do this sticker is super crooked I'm just going to get rid of it oh back to oh I this is was a mistake I have made it worse the only thing that can make it better is a segue to our sponsor thanks to charge for sponsoring this video while the galaxy book should in
theory last you all day the Shar geeek 170 power bank is jam-packed with a "24,000 milliamp hour capacity meaning" you get a full extra cycle in and then some it has a 170 WT total output threshold with a single USBC Port supporting two-way charging of up to 140 WS thanks to its PD 3 3.1 standard which means it both charges and gets charged super quick and while you're charging your laptop up plug in different devices to give them a top up too the Shar geek 170 has two USBC ports and one USB a
port for added versatility plus you can even monitor your charging process with their built-in informative display so check out this beastly battery buddy and give your devices the charge they deserve at the link down below wow that sponsor segue did really clean that up let's Boot It Up secured by nox o fancy their noox chip is actually pretty cool is its own dedicated chip that secures all of your sensitive stuff in its own little area for enhanced not getting hacked I don't know why but this touch
pad just like makes me feel like I'm drunk like they have some really brutal Mouse acceleration on it and I just keep on missing the stuff that I'm going for like let's go for the X at the top right missed it completely missed it not even close it feels really jelly and you can kind of see that it seems like the pulling rate is also really low I'm almost certain that's a touchpad problem and nothing to do with like the display one sec yeah that's awesome that is absolutely perfect you can see like I'm
moving it across here it looks really really nice on this display one other thing that I just noticed is that you don't actually get the full display if you look we have rounded corners on the edges it's something that they did on the uh surfaces and I guess they're doing here as well oh my God M's acceleration anyway anyway anyway specs specs the specs are good in here we have an Intel Core Ultra 7 155h that is 16 cores 22 threads and these things are really really fast also
we have 16 GB of RAM which it says row of chips so they are presumably soldered down actually they're definitely soldered down cuz they're running at 7467 megat transfers per second so you do get really fast Ram at least even though you can't upgrade it for the SSD we have a 512 GB nbme SSD from Samsung love to see it you guys make excellent drives we also have arc graphics an npu with Intel's AI boost and to top it off an RTX 4050 which means even though this right here won't be a super duper gaming
laptop it'll probably be a pretty darn good one and also for Content creation like video editing photo editing all of that stuff it is going to be a beast this 4050 also also goes up to 80 wats tgp which is very healthy for a 40/50 you'll be getting most of the performance out of it a it's a touchcreen we''ve got OLED we've got touch we've got oh my God this thing looks good this also has a dynamic refresh rate so it's able to go from 48 to 120 HZ based on battery saving stuff
but do note that it's not gsync so it's not going to be doing that for like frame pacing and games it's more so just for power savings the resolution also is a little bit more than quad h D so 2880 by 1800p and hot damn this thing is excellent the brightness on this panel is fantastic in SDR you get 400 nits and in HDR 600 nits and for both of those that is full screen brightness so you don't have anything where like a little tiny window gets super bright and then when it gets blown up and it all kind of
looks like junk no this just no matter what you get that full brightness out of those OLED pixels and look at that pitch black of course this is a Samsung device so out of the box everything is pretty saturated on display but it has heaps of color profiles so if you just clamp it down to srgb we have an average Delta e of 1.2 which is absolutely fantastic we expect less than two if you want to do professional color work so you can do that on here also in HDR the content on
this looks fantastic and we measured an average Delta e of 13.4 which is really quite good cuz HDR you are getting both the color and the brightness to match which is a bit more difficult and this display does a fantastic job of that just look at this for a second Andrew like like just the background these little details right here one thing I did miss before cuz we just weren't connected to the internet is that we have a Wi-Fi 6 e card in here which is quite good but I do wish that I
had Wi-Fi 7 given that this is a very premium device is the keyboard good though there is one thing that's kind of annoying about this we have an international version of the keyboard instead of like a North American one so we don't have a big shift on the left  that I don't know how I feel about this keyboard if I'm honest objectively speaking it seems pretty good like if we look here if I push on the side of the key it actuates the entire key before I can get much dipping also key to key the
force is really quite good and the chassis is nice and stiff so it's really nice and consistent there is I think it's a little bit stiffer on the right hand side compared to the left but it's not too bad that said though the actuation profile is super weird like there's no pre-act tuation if that makes sense like you press on the key nothing happens then it goes I think part of it is that now that I've touched it more there is definitely some inconsistencies in the switching Force like some of them
take a little bit more Force than others but mostly it's just kind of a strange proile like it I don't know you feel like you're really thonking you're you're thonking the keyboard overall though I'm going to give it an A minus I think it's a solid keyboard you can you can type on it I got up to almost full speed there actually I would say that I got up to full speed and I think that I would get used to it in an hour or so and just be ripping on it performance- wise here are the results from the labs
and overall I would say it did quite well given that it's an Ultra Book and it's not particularly large but at the same time it got AB absolutely smashed by the Asus G14 which is both smaller and cheaper so if you're looking for actual just raw performance this is not what you want in here we have two wolfers that I reach 5 watts and two tweeters that I reach two Watts which should be very good sounding especially since they were tuned by  decent okay that's not too bad that's not too bad I can jam to
that all right let's let's see how it compares to a MacBook Pro 14  murdered nice and clear nice and clear not even close ouch all right let's have a look at the webcam here it's 1080p 2 megapixel and Samsung of course on all of their phones has been doing an excellent job with their cameras and it looks like they have applied that here too this is having a bit of trouble directly into the lights but it's still is exposing for my face we turn around here is it able to figure it out yeah no
problem at all looks nice and clear and crisp and overall seems pretty good do we have facial recognition no compatible camera oh sadness we do have a fingerprint reader up here on the right hand side which is on top of the power button best spot to have it but that said I do wish that there was facial recognition especially at this price you haven't talked about it yet but you're going to you're going to poop yourself when you find out how much this thing costs this is the bit that I said would
be annoying at the start where we have to remove these oh that actually come off really easily normally these are glued on and just never go back on but maybe these feet won't be too bad although it also looks like they'll just fall off after a year or two so that's not so good four rubber feet four Phillips head screws and a bunch of prying later and we are in up top here we have a big old Vapor chamber which is how we were able to extract those 80 Watts out of the 40 50 I see a
replaceable SSD right here and an upgrade slot right there for a second SSD love to see that sadly the Wi-Fi card is soldered down so if you want Wi-Fi 7 I don't know just don't buy this laptop and for the battery here it is 73.8 W hours and the battery life they were able to extract from this thing is incredible in our endurance test we were able to get over 11 and 1/2 hours on battery in this thing and espe especially given this has an OLED display that is incredible Intel's new
processors even though they might not be much faster are proving to be quite efficient and I do really appreciate that I misread the spec sheet I thought this was $400 less and still a bad value but this right here with 16 GB of RAM 1 TB SSD and RTX  $2400 it's it's a bit of a sin cuz this overall quite a good laptop I could see a lot of people really enjoying this thing if they didn't just have every single other laptop as an option at that price you could instead get a zephyris g16 for
"$22,000 that has the same amount of RAM" and storage but an RTX 470 and I'm pretty sure it's the exact same panel from Samsung also this is available with up to a 470 and that config is "$3,000 so uh I just don't get it it" simply makes no sense for the price that they're asking to buy this laptop it's got like a couple medium compromises like the keyboard's okay trackpads kind of weird speakers are fine for that price it needs to be brilliant for comparison the brand new Spectre X360
from HP has as far as I can tell the exact same OLED panel which is a touchcreen 4050 same specs that one is 6 ",60 compared to $2400 for this so" overall I just I have no clue where that price comes from Samsung has made the battery they made the SSD they made the display and probably a bunch of the other stuff in here and presumably they get a good price on all of those things but you certainly do not but what you do get is a thank you from me huge thanks for watching this video hit like get
subscribed and have a great all day see you later
