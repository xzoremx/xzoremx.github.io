we're at the Asus Booth here at CES 2024 to see something that I really wasn't expecting this soon we're used to seeing nucks in has been making them for a long time they're really awesome small computers with a lot of horsepower generally relative to their size but having Asus before that is a new thing see back last year Asus acquired the nuck everything apparently even employees which is kind of crazy fast forward like a couple of months and there's now an Rog knock I don't think it's going to be
cheap but it looks cool and I imagine it's going to go pretty fast now unfortunately I don't have a box so the unboxing is going to have to be taking the thing apart which when I asked about it they were a little skittish we'll see what happens there for iio on the back we've got another two 10 gig USB ports these ones curiously are labeled as 10 gig but you can see that they're little black ports these are just going to be USB 2.0 they just have to fix the silk screen for the mass production version
we've got 2.5 gig Intel ethernet a 40 GB Thunderbolt Port that does do USB power delivery they would expect if the system is you know not running like a gaming lad that this can put out around 90 watts and then during gaming about 65 if it needs to so it's kind of a dynamic power delivery got HDMI 2.1 DP 1.4a and then they power in for the big power brake that means you can run four 4K displays off of this machine I kind of doubt that most people will do that but if you wanted to you could and there's
also a keny lock which is a nice thing to see around front we have those other two us ports an SD card reader and a combo mic headphone jack and then the power button so why don't we turn it on hey it works Nvidia confidential what the heck show it get Asus in trouble as configured this is the core 7 155h configuration so this is the lower end model but still testing pretty good "like 32,000 in CPU Mark is pretty" respectable for the 3D mark this is what I'm more curious about 360 TI scores
"like 20,000 half during the pass Mark" run the highest we got on the GPU was 103 watts and the highest we got on the CPU was also 103 watt that being said any sort of like temperature or performance numbers are kind of to be taken with a grain of salt um this is a pre-production unit it's still still scoring pretty well but could be different than what you end up with and also this is the lower-end model um maybe we run like cine bench just for funsies the CPU is at 106 degrees but it
is drawing 100 Watts technically intel only rates this CPU to stay sustained at 65 WS anything higher than that is Turbo so it is still turboing it really doesn't feel like the fans are going that hard maybe it's cuz it's an engineering sample maybe it's cuz they just want it to be a quiet system there's definitely heat coming off there though I mean sure it's not a cin bench content creation machine but it's still scoring well above a 5800 X desktop chip in cinebench and this is the lower end skew
this is hilarious tread rer 2990 WX 32 "core it's 1,200 points this is 1,000" points this is 32 cores from several years ago is only 20% faster than the 16 cores I've never run cinam bench GPU I didn't even know that this was a thing wow it scores the same as a Radeon Pro W 6800 which I have zero Conta for 1440p right now um I get 200 FPS I mean performing pretty well I don't know I honestly don't have that much context for CS2 as to what this would be but you guys can make your own judgment based on
that 1440p maxed out the settings we tried to update the NVIDIA drivers and it didn't work it's pre-release Hardware so probably some Nvidia lock but in the game our GPU was drawing between and 90 Watts pretty consistently sitting at around 70Â° CPU temp is high I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe there is something going on with the CPU Cooler given that it's a pre-release it wasn't drawing much power seemingly in the 30 to 45 watt range theyed reasonably quiet although the noise floor in here is
super high cool let's take it apart but first let me tell you about our sponsor thanks to B quiet for sponsoring our 20124 CES coverage if you're shopping for your next PC or just new components in general make sure to check out be quiet the premium products include PC cases power supplies Water and Air Cooling and fans for desktop PCS with roots in Germany they've been in the industry for more than 20 years and specialize in making high quality parts that are nearly inaudible this year at
CES they're showcasing new white PC cases white fans and even white hard drive cages so step into the world of Silent Computing with be quiet at the link down below oh look at that beauty damn boy that's some big fans it looks like this whole section here is just one big old heat sink and then you've got two discret blower style fans I give you my word it will go back together I'm not giving you my word that it will work for storage right now it's a Samsung kind of OEM looking SSD uh
they have not confirmed this yet uh or the capacities even but they said they probably expect maybe a 512 and a 1 TB skew but the interesting thing is you will be able to buy this as a Bare Bones which is pretty cool not something I would expect from but welcome nonetheless regardless of what spec you were to buy there is three m.2 slots they are all pcie Gen 4 by4 you could load this thing up with like 24 tabt of Sab 8 tab drives if you wanted it's soim slots which is great I
would kind of expect a system like this to have soldered memory which is a sad State of Affairs but this one does not uh they expect the actual configurations to be a 1632 probably but you can also get a bare bones and put whatever you want in it I asked if if in the Bios you'll be able to screw around with like memory timings and the answer I got was TBD um but at the very least it will work with 5600 which is reasonably fast for a system like this I got confirmation there won't be any sort of
XMP settings it's because Intel meteor Lake doesn't support it so they're they're taking the easy route and saying well Intel said I can't do it I've seen motherboard computer manufacturers go around stuff like that before just saying just saying all of the m.2 slots have a toolless mechanism to kind of go along with the tooless theme this one is an Intel killer ax 1690 I it's a 2x2 Wi-Fi 60 chip so we can do a60 wide 60 okay so there's the Wi-Fi antenna that's cool that's a good place to put them on
the front so even if you slide this into your like Media Console or whatever still has the antennas exposed they don't have a backup of this so if I break it it's the demo is broken and ooo hey look at that woo the CPU looks so baby compared to the GPU speaking of CPU there's going to be two options for this chassi a core Ultra 9 185h and a core Ultra 7 155h they're both 16 core chips they both have the same performance efficiency low power efficiency configuration the main
difference boost clocks and base clocks are going to be higher on the ultra 9 and then you're also going to see a lower base power on the ultra 7 and the GPU will be a little bit slower that being said the TDP of both is technically the same 45 watts and the max assured power which is what Intel rates in optimal circumstances it should be able to run consistently at is the same on both and uh Asus is saying that they should be able to run at that 65 wat TDP consistently with this thermal
solution that being said when you move over to the GPU there is some kind of funky power stuff going on there this can either be an RTX 4060 or 4070 obviously the mobile skew uh so you're looking at 115 W TDP on both of those chips but they have Dynamic boost which means it can kind of intelligently steal power from the CPU and allocate it to the GPU if it thinks that that will give you a better gaming experience which a lot of the time uh it can so it can go all the way up to 140 WS which again
Asus says they're targeting to make sure it can do sustain consistently uh and handle that full load which is great cuz sometimes you see like a 4060 or 4 7 in a laptop and you're like oh that's great and then it's a 35 wat capped 470 and you're like okay that's not really what I was wanting to buy there is a vapor chamber over the GPU which is pretty baller and then the CPU just has these two gargantuan heat pipes overall it seems like a relatively serviceable relatively
tooless at least as far as uh normies would go let's say you can buy it as a barebones which I like but there is still kind of one C avat which is the price if you look at other kind of big Brands similar systems it's not entirely out to lunch I was told you're looking "around $14 to $1,500 for the Bare Bones" with the 4060 and the lower-end core7 "and probably around $1,800 for the" barebones of the higher end 470 skew if you were going to purchase a complete system with ram and storage you're
looking around 17 to 1800 for the lower tier 4060 model or around 21 to 22 for the higher end 470 model which is not nothing it's a fair bit of money I don't know what else I would compare it to it obviously if you compare to a custom built system which is going to be a lot larger you have to build it all these things obviously the price to Performance is not going to be the same but if you need something that's small seemingly quiet and seemingly tooless this could be a serious option to look
at you'll see in a few months I guess maybe we'll do a full review let us know down in the comments if you want to see that get subscribed like don't miss out with the rest of our CES show coverage goodbye
