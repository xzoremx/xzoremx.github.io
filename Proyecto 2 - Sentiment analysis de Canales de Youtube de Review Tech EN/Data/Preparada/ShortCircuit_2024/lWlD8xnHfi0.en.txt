SmartWatches are expensive I mean think about it you've already paid a lot for your phone and then you're expected to spend hundreds more to get a smartwatch where half of the functions are still tied to that phone it's kind of ridiculous which is why I'm excited that cmf a budget brand from nothing the guys who made the nothing phone have come out with a budget Smartwatch a a watch Pro two there was a first version but it never saw release in North America and they're coming back strong with a bit of
a different look I mean probably pretty generic when it comes to you know watches but compared to the Square apple watches look of their previous model I like the look of this a lot more and inside they don't really have much else other than a charger with USB a okay sure and it also has a magnetic charger with Pogo pins that attaches to the bottom there already I wish this was like a cradle kind of like the pixel watch where you can just kind of place your watch in there in almost any
orientation this requires you to not not only make sure that you have this facing the right way but also the Watch The Wire has to come out of the left side or else it's going to be it's not going to connect properly hopefully you won't have to charge it very often because they're claiming up to 9 days of heavy use what heavy use constitutes I'm not sure it comes with a silicon strap which is pretty sporty but it does come with other strap options one thing I already like is that it's using a standard mount
for the strap the frame itself is made with an aluminum alloy and comes with a nice little crown the Red Dot on the crown is very reminiscent of other nothing branded kind of stuff as well as on the bezel you can see the like dot matrix kind of font for the cmf thing and by nothing I think that's a nice little detail on the back we have a bunch of biometric sensors I think they're mostly focused around heart rate and SP2 we have a speaker in here some microphones you can take calls on this
and one cool thing about this is that the bezel is replaceable like that cmf is planning to offer a few different varieties your bezels like to get scuffed because it is kind of supposed to protect the screen so if it gets you know scraped or stuff you can still have a clean looking watch speaking of the screen it is a 1.32 in AMOLED display with a resolution of 466 X 466 and it can get up to 620 nits of peak brightness which is pretty good just kind of looking side by side with
my pixel watch which I really like the size of I don't have particularly large wrists it is a little bit taller few couple millimeters taller but not so bad it's not so bulky um I think that the uh hard edges make it look a little bit bigger compared to say something like the massive Apple watch Ultra which just looks Gigantic on a lot of different arms I'm not a huge fan of the placement of the crown it's a little close to the lugs I guess is what they're called um which means that if you have like bigger
fingers it's kind of tricky to get multiple fingers in there if you really need to if you really need to spin there is haptic feedback when I scroll through this list and it um feel very good it feels very cheap and there's also like kind of a cheap rattly noise it just it just sounds it's not very robust and now that we've covered everything on the outside let's talk about the software that's on the inside after this message from our sponsor thanks to EO maker for sponsoring
today's video their Galaxy 80 designed in collaboration with fcker is a premium tkl mechanical keyboard without the premium price it combines a full aluminum alloy shell ergonomically curved key caps and a whole slew of foam and padding to bring a full-blown sensory experience when typing and of course it still has the awesome features you'd expect like a hot swappable PCB south facing RGB and options for Wired and wireless connections check them out at the link in the description down
below take a look at that that's the default watch face on it you can see the outdoor temperature steps calories one thing I wish is that these were actually um buttons to get to like different widgets like I wish I could go to my podometer app or my weather app or my clock app however it seems that I have to press the crown to navigate to the menu and then navigate to that app from my understanding they have a custom operating system but it seems very similar to were OS which is great cuz I
like we OS we have Quick Settings at the top we have notifications if we swipe up we can uh go to widgets on the sides and stuff like that one thing I do notice is that you can see that um the bezels even though they have this nice bezel that you remove you don't actually go all the way to the edge with the screen on the inside I kind of wish that because they had the option of making this little bezel go over top that we didn't have to have this big extra bezel on the bottom
you know and they got a ton of watch faces apparently 100 of them multifunction this looks like my kind of thing I like seeing all of my info in one quick go we've heard from owners of their last watch that the app can tend to be a little bit buggy but so far it looks okay one thing you should note is that since this isn't a wear OS watch there's no extra apps that you can download if you say have a specific app that you want to use like I like using say straa you are stuck with the
whatever cmf gives you however this does have integration with straa as well as Apple health and Health Connect which will allow you to kind of transfer the data from this to pretty much any other app in the Health Connect ecosystem so stuff like Fitbit or a lot of dieting apps like my fitness pal basically that's kind of the API that you can send everything to and get your data between whatever apps you want to use one thing that I care about is actually heart rate detection I have atrial fibrillation
which means my heart doesn't really beat properly all the time when I'm having a an episode with apib I like to be able to track it on my watch cuz then I can send it to my doctor and we can keep track of uh exactly what kind of rhythms are happening this is not rated by the FDA to track apib but it does have arhythmia notification so if it senses in a regular heartbeat it will note it honestly it's a pretty robust app run tracking GPS all of that stuff GPS on device by the way not through your phone
you don't need to run with your phone to track GPS but let's quickly go through a lot of the other features they have they have 120 different uh exercise modes including jet skiing the one that I'm always doing it's ip68 water resistant which isn't quite good enough for say like swimming they have like a smart movement algorithm that they claim can measure the effectiveness training load and recovery time I could see maybe recovery time if they're just kind of gauging by your heart rate but any sort
of motion tracking that I done on SmartWatches in the past in terms of like working out at the gym they don't really help you at all but all of that stuff comes in at a price of $69 which is great honestly that's cheaper than any Fitbit you're like competing with like a lot of the Chinese uh Brands like tick watch or Amaze fit and I think you're getting a pretty solid experience and you're going to be backed by a company that's a a little bit more familiar in the western territories now
I would need to spend a little bit more time to make sure that all of the apps that are default work smoothly but this is kind of what I want I don't need a do everything Smartwatch I want something that can give me notifications that can track my fitness and this does everything and it does it just so much cheaper than other major brands and it makes me wonder why these other brands aren't even trying to make something good at this price point I think they did a great job thanks for watching this
short circuit if you like this video why don't you learn about a more premium offering the pixel Watch 2 James did a great job on that video I'm so proud of him
