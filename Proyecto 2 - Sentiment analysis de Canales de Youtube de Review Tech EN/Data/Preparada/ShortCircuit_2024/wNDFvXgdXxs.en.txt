don't you guys just hate having your airpods just hanging out doing inconvenient things like being in your pocket wow that was so difficult putting this in your backpack unimaginable what if they were inside of your laptop well that's what we have here today this is the Juku metat Tumi secret book pro jaku jaaku ja Jac I'm sorry Billy Billy get mad at me anyway let's open it up the the exact name of this is kind of a mystery if I'm honest uh translate and the websites and stuff give us different
things it can be any of these I'm going to go with Seeker book because it makes me think of the big bug things in balim  those your hands how do they work ooh this is powerful here we have 100 wat gallium nitride charger and for 100 WTS that is pretty darn good it really looks like it's from a Macbook and uh I appreciate it not bad type c length of the cable is oh that's not 6 ft 5 ft maybe 1.5 M probably can you tell this is China only here we go I know enough to understand this though
plug it in open it up hit the power button you're good to go heck yeah ooh o I like this so on the right hand side here we have a webcam disable headphone microphone combo Jack and two us B type A's looks like one of them is 3.0 and the other one is two and honestly I kind of like having USB 2 around cuz there's so many just older devices that much prefer it on the Le hand side we have USB 4 another type A fulls sizee HDMI and a normal USB type-c so this is actually a really solid load
out of IO here especially given the size and weight of this thing is really quite good let's give it a little little look here 3.1 lb no not too bad and it feels quite decent on the back it says metap and let's open it up one finger ooh no problem oh this font is cool I dig it the build quality seems to be fantastic it appears to be stamped aluminum so it's very similar to like hp's Envy lineup and it's shockingly wellb built but the most shocking thing look look at this Andy zoom in right here
bam can your laptop do that in here we have oh how do I do this here are our earbuds these right here are Bluetooth paired to the device and they just store right in your trackpad they're bigger than I expected how do how do I look oh oh why is it so loud it just yelled pearing at me without the earbuds in there it looks a little bit strange but the the thing that I think it looks the most like is a segue to our sponsor rocket money thanks rocket money for sponsoring this video rocket money is
the personal finance app that helps you cancel subscriptions lower bills and manage your money better to securely track your monthly spending and cancel unwanted or forgotten subscriptions which means more money for a new laptop so go to rocket.com shortcircuit to join the 5 million users they already have and get saving today all right let's give it a little power on here wonder if there's a fingerprint reader in that power button there is cool we're we're just we're just going straight into these I can't
wait for this to just get absolutely filled with junk all of your Cheetos and I don't know Ramen or what do people eat in China Andy meta whe earphones why are they called that also uh this came with Chinese version of Windows which does not have any other languages you can reinstall it and get like English but uh we didn't it's too bad that you guys can't hear what I'm hearing how's that probably bad okay these are not the best headphones that I have ever heard so uh there's a lot of Base heaps of
Base pretty much only Bas the uh mids are kind of not in existence and the high hats are super loud but not Airy like you just get like a sharpness to them but not the like that you normally get and that was all basically confirmed by headphones.com you can see the graph looks not the best that we have ever seen also uh they stopped being paired which is also not the best I have ever seen given they come in it am I able to connect these to my phone it does sound like based off of
me playing it off of my phone that even though there's a lot of Base it doesn't go all the way down which is kind of unfort forunate and he just said that I should look into these headphones for video call Quality cuz that is what they're advertised for and I can guarantee you that it's pretty mediocre given that the response is all base and not a whole lot of mids it's going to be pretty obscured when you're on a video conferencing call should we test the actual speakers while we're here like we 
open yep that's uh actually pretty clear so not too bad there but it is certainly uh lacking in base and volume but I do prefer that to just it completely distorting at high volume so not too bad it's usable all right what are we actually working with here though cuz other than that gimmick which is I would definitely say a gimmick I think we have a very solid laptop here especially given it has a 13th gen i7 13700 H that is 14 cores for you 32 GB of RAM 5200 me transfers per
second so maybe we can swap it out oh but it says row chips probably not a 1 TB SSD Intel WiFi 6 love to see that and just integrated Graphics but that is what you expect from a laptop that is like this this display looks really good let me look at our results for our display this is IPS 2560 x600 and 16 by 10 which I do really appreciate it looks quite fantastic to me 100% coverage of srgb and 120 HZ refresh rate that is pretty darn good oh damn I was expecting the accuracy to be pretty mediocre but
our Labs tested it so 99.5% of srgb that is quite good and the accuracy in srgb is fantastic with an average Delta e of 1.6 so you can actually do professional color work on this thing right here and trust that the colors will be accurate that said you can't go all the way out to Adobe RGB or DCI P3 but most content on the Internet is srgb anyway so you're not going to be missing out a whole lot also with a brightness of 41 nits it's bright enough for most indoor situations
outdoor you're going to struggle a little bit oh no HDR though which is a bit unfortunate all right let's give  the keyboard is not bad I'm going to give it a solid B it's not inconsistent at all they've actually really nailed the consistency between the keys and if you look the stability itself is also really quite good and this is aided by the chassis stiffness being excellent across here too the problem is that the switches themselves are just very not satisfying they're really mushy like you
can just hear it like yeah you can probably tell from that that they're just not satisfying at all to type on but that said I can get up to full speed so actually let's give them a B+ it's not going to hold you back you're just you're not going to enjoy your time with it very similar with the trackpad it isn't super big cuz a bunch of it's getting taken up by your earphones here and the clicks same sort of thing it's but that said I haven't had it misclicking like even though you can
hear two clicks here it's not triggering the right click when I don't want it to the tracking is really quite good so overall the inputs I like them I don't love them but I do like them all right let's see how it is in rocket League this is pretty promising actually the frame pacing isn't great like I'm having lows sometimes dipping into 30s but at 1080p I am getting a solid 90 FPS like I was able to hit that into the net that's not too bad this is definitely aided by
it being 120 HZ display this is actually a much better gaming experience than I would expect for a laptop like this oh big hitch there low of 8 FPS for a second not fantastic oh wait I need to put it in what what's the mode called Berserker mode one sec Berserker mode there we go we're now up to 96 FPS haven't seen any big dips yet oh we're over 100 hot Dam I am surprised how smoothly that went I have seen actual gaming laptops that have much worse experiences than that right there and
with the i7 in this you can play 3D games and not have a terrible time as long as they're not too graphically demanding for our Labs testing we compared it to an HP Pavilion which does have a 12th gen chip unfortunately but it is also a slight  the and the ja just destroyed the HP it's actually for what it is quite a fast little machine I am impressed oh and we did test it in balanced mode which has a silly name battle mode I love the modes it's seal battle and Berserker and here's our non-gaming
performance it actually did pretty good especially in puug bench is there anything else oh webcam we can't find your camera that confirms that our webcam switch works just fantastic and it actually doesn't look too bad it's only 720p but at the same time it's exposing pretty well for my face I don't look like a tomato or anything like that there it's overexposing a lot but is it going to figure it out there we go I'm actually perfectly happy with this webcam it is neither good or bad it
just is oh they didn't they didn't oh oh no heads oh hate it I was going to say eight Philips head screws later and we're in but I need to yep that's never going back on the same damn it guys all right 10 Phillips head screws and a ruined rubber foot later and we are in oh you can just see them right there hello all right so here we can see our heat pipe Arrangement it is just two heat pipes and two little fans but at the same time for just an Intel chip it's pretty decent and we did see that
the performance is quite good right here we have our SSD can we put double-sided in here yep double-sided SSD passes that goes in just fine down here we have our battery it is 52 W hours and got a little bit over 6 hours of battery life in our endurance test which is not bad but not amazing I do kind of wish I the amount that I would give up these earphones in here for for just more battery right there is I would not even think about it I would do that in a second but that said overall I'm I'm
pretty impressed with this machine can't upgrade the RAM but you can game on it and do lots of stuff 32 GB of RAM i7 that 120 HZ panel that's Quad HD for $830 not bad the only unfortunate thing about it is that uh you probably can't buy it unless you're watching it on Billy bellly hey guys it is a China only laptop but if you can figure out how to procure it it's a pretty fantastic little machine I like it and I hope that you can procure just a fantastic old day hit like get subscribed and I'll see you
later
