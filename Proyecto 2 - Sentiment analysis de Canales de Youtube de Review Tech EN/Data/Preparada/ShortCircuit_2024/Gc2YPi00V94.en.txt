we're here at kutex 2024 to look at what might be one of the biggest Innovations in water cooling in years and years this right here is the cold plate of an aiio but all of it has been metal 3D printed onto here and it is so flipping cool now how an AIO works is pretty simple you've got your radiator right here that yeets the heat out got a pump that pumps the water around but the bit that we are interested in is the cold plate right here and that can have a huge impact on
your performance because how good this is at getting the heat out of your CPU can be completely transformative to how good your AIO can perform and what we have here is from fabric 8 Labs if you look instead of your typical fins that will just be like skyed on we have complete freedom of what geometry we want one of the most important things for getting your CPU cool is having loads of surface area of the copper above it now in the past that was done through skying basically you take a
really sharp blade and a whole bunch of weight and you just push off a tiny little sliver a whole bunch of times but the problem is that with this process you have no control over the geometry besides just how thick the copper is and how big the space is between each fin now though we can do stuff like this or like this or like this and we have complete Freedom over over the flow path completely and the most insane thing they used AI in a way that's not just completely stupid this is a cold plate
that's optimized for thread Ripper so those are massive and also because thread Ripper has multiple dieses you can have some really hot spots on there and it can be really difficult to get that heat away evenly but what they have done here is by having that heat map put into an AI model they were able to generate a whole bunch of different ways to do the flow path and they eventually came up with this right here as the absolute best option and it is crazy like if you look where the die is here
they have some little blockers so most of the flow will be going over your really hot bits and then you can have way less flow on the outsides here it's really freaking cool oh jeez we nearly forgot to segue to our sponsor thanks to private internet access for sponsoring our 2024 computex coverage their VPN network spans across six continents in 91 countries letting you access your local catalog of content from all over the globe plus with a single subscription you get unlimited

you look on this side they are really really tight and that is going to mean that you're going to have a whole lot of pressure and super high velocity of your fluid but if you do that across your entire heat sink like you would if you had a whole bunch of really tight Sky fins you're going to need a massive pump to push water through all of that so instead here you can see that on the right it's super dense but then it gets progressively less dense as we go across so that you can have a whole bunch of
high pressure high velocity fluid on the right but then maybe over here if you don't care as much about the thermal performance it's a bit easier on your pump system I've been following fabric 8 labs for a little bit and their 3D printed water cooling stuff but what I was not expecting was anytime in like the next 10 years to see it as a commercial product but that's what we have right here they have teamed up with acch to make a completely 3D printed coal plate and they say that for every
100 Watts that your CPU outputs this rate here can drop 2° C so say that you have a 300 W CPU that means that you have 6° more cooling with this guy that is crazy I've been talking about 3D printing but uh how the heck 3D printing well it's a thing that's called electrochemical additive manufacturing or ecam for sure it's kind of like putting together Electro plating and 3D printing into one thing and also some display technology it's sort of like OLED I'll explain it the process is
similar to an SLA printer so we have our build plate on the top and our print head down on the bottom which is sort of like an OLED panel but instead of pixels that create photons to display an image it has little electrodes that create a current to deposit copper onto our build plate these pixels have incredible density 33 microns and you can have about two of them to create a feature for a feature size of just 60 microns or 70 maybe that's really freaking small smaller than a human hair how you turn
that current into copper is by Just Simply Having copper that is dissolved into water and this is very cheap and very available it is super common used in electr plating so it's actually not a very expensive process and if if you know anything about displays they are pretty much the only thing that has just kept on getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and being able to use that technology for your 3D printer means that we're not having to do any super crazy uh laser burning copper or stuff
like that that's incredibly expensive instead it's actually quite scalable which is how we have a real product that's going to exist sometime in the near future now the process isn't particularly fast they're getting about 1 mm per hour but you are able to have four of these on a build Plate at a time and the machines themselves are not particularly expensive so even though you need a lot of them it doesn't get too out of hand too fast now acch won't tell us exactly when they're expecting
for this to hit the market but they said somewhere around Q3 Q4 this year and the pricing again TBD but they said it'll be a premium and given that the ryogen that it's going into is already pretty premium priced I don't think it'll be cheap but that said the 3D printing technology has lots more uses than coal plates like this one really cool example that they have here are some radar sensors for cars so those are looking out and seeing if there's you know a car in front of you for your adaptive cruise
and stuff like that but the problem is that a traditional antenna just kind of yeets out electric waves that way this right here instead by using that metal 3D printing is able to very precisely control it so that you can have a really wide beam this way but not a very wide beam this way cuz you don't care about what's happening on the ground or the sky you just want to see the cyclist that's right there somewhere here you can see the inner geometry of how they able to create that really cool beam
pattern and one of the best parts is that the whole process is done at room temperature so you don't have to be doing any crazy stuff like heating up your metal to super high temperatures just like you don't have to heat up to hit like And subscribe huge thanks for watching hit like and subscribed and just have a great old day we have a bunch more computex videos coming to you and I'll see you soon
