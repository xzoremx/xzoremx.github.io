remember the pixel buds Pro well there's another one the pro twos and are these the de facto airpods for Android or did Samsung take that crown with their new buds that look a lot like airpods now we got a completely cardboard case here and you know what that looks like a Google pixelbuds case I don't think they've changed that basically at all except for this little doohickey down here which I think is for the new find by buds feature inside we find ear ear tips for different sizes of ear holes wow a lural
two-page IKEA style guide how to put them in your ears and then the whole like warning this is illegal in California your head will explode we're all going to die no charging cable whatsoever not even a little you know inchworm piece of crap C to a like nothing just nothing although I guess maybe they're making the argument that they like support wireless charging so you know you have a charger it's your phone you just pop this thing on top of there I don't know how do they sleep at
night look at last year's model very similar different little bottom thing and another thing you might notice at first glance these just look like pixel buds don't they but actually they're tiny now look at that they used to be about 25% bigger and heavier they made these so small now they almost look miniature it's kind of weird that's pretty kind of sucks it right in there if I put it backwards it's that's that's not going to happen happen what if I go the wrong way come
on no they're basically keyed and of course you got the indicator light this isn't the only color though there's four in total including Hazel py which is pink and Porcelain normal white I'm going to get these things in my head here and listen to them on the old this old coffee bean design from last year is just completely smooth but the new one has this little Sports fin on it and they actually say this as a feature you can choose to put it in your ear with it not in contact with your PIN
or you can rotate it so that that fin is I think on the back you just put them in and turn until it's in contact with your ear and it's like super in place if you want to do wind Sprints or hit training or something so let's see what is up with these if I even feel like I can put them in multiple orientations cuz I'll say right off the bat when I don't have them rotated in like they are now which does feel very secure if I rotate them this way it feels like they're kind of
downward and especially on this wacky ear that I have they feel like they could maybe come out I think the idea is that you're sacrificing fit for long-term Comfort if I wear it like this for 8 hours it'll be more comfortable than if I if I'm locked in I feel like I'm getting a pretty good seal with the medium tips so I'm going to keep those on let's get these back in the case so I can pair them to my device here we have a pixel 9 so this will actually support all the features that these earphones
have I mentioned the question are these the airpods of Android and I think an argument for no is whether there's features on here that are only supported by certain phones and the Samsungs have that too this feature you have to have the new Galaxy or the new pixel in this case there's no Bluetooth over Ultra wide band if you don't have a pixel 6 or newer oh there it is and it's even green a cool thing about the way Google does this is there's no secondary app it's all in the settings page which is does
it really matter I don't know definitely going to have a limited functionality that way but something cool about it you know on the other hand if you are for some reason getting these to go with your iPhone you're just just not going to have an app all right before we dive into this though I'm just going to listen to music let's listen to how they sound right after this message from our sponsor gotcha thanks to T for sponsoring today's video they're calling in to help you stop overpaying for your

children are obsessed with this song   funny okay I didn't even get to the loudest Notch there that was very loud although they didn't sound awful like I remember the Samsung started to get a little like cilent and harsh sounding up there that was just I was just winsing cuz it was so loud I do want to try them with noise counseling off though because as we'll see in the graphs in a minute they actually sound different if you look at the frequency response curve that we have provided to us graciously
by headphones.com thank you in the base and up into the mids it's a little too loud about the target curve I should say uh whereas in the treble there's a little bit where it's actually a bit depressed but now look at the frequency respon curve for A&amp;C on where it's way more natural the reading really closely follows that Target curve through the base and through the mid-range until you get to this big wonky lump here around 600 to 700 and then it's kind of a little bit all over the place in the
trouble overall I would say they do sound pretty dang good like I was rocking out in these things I think you will too they took an opposite approach to Samsung who with their default listening mode I would I would call ay on default personally um they wanted it to be a little more Bassy and as I said in that video I think that was kind of the right move because I think most people like to have the bass turned up a little bit Google here went kind of the natural route but of course with both
these devices you can change that with EQ in the app or non-app as it were uh let's check that out now checking our settings menu here we have fine device which is new and we'll actually put the location on a map which is very cool once you get close you can make it ring here is the EQ oh do they not even give you little knobbies they have presets sets like heavy base light base balanced vocal boost Clarity and last save here we go custom equalizer you get five little knobbies and do I get to name my
Custom Creation I guess last saved you does that mean you can't have multiple that you save that's kind of weak there's no option to name them or whatever so it's just one one custom one and then Volume EQ enhances base and trouble frequencies at lower volume levels this actually is an option unlike on the Samsung buds 3 Pro they didn't even have an option for volume dependent EQ which means you turn the music down and it all just goes down with this option on when you turn the music down
some parts of the frequency notably the Basse and some parts of the treble will actually get boosted in volume because our ear is not as sensitive to those frequencies at lower volumes so it's nice to have the option there's an ear tip seal check that's useful to make sure that you're using the right size tips on your earbuds getting a good seal will give you better Basse response oh conversation detection this is not a new fature but it's a fature I've never tried whereby you can automatically
switch from noise cancellation to transparency mode when someone starts talking to you I'm going to try it out noise cancellation is on and now I'm talking oh look at that it automatically changed it's when you talk it's not when someone talks to you so interesting and I can actually dismiss it by tapping there it goes it works oh no you can't stop it once it's starts I do wonder if it'll switch to transparency mode just from me singing along to music but I I won't make you suffer through watching that
demonstration so and here's what the three onboard microphones in each earbud sound like when you do a voice recording or a call uh you know that the voice recording is going through the earbuds because the phone has been taken away by my lovely assistant I will say this conversation detection is actually quite annoying and I am turning it off and I probably wouldn't actually use that but I'm a talkative guy apparently with the new fancy Google tensor chip on here I have the ability to use a new special
wake word for I guess not the Google Assistant exactly but for more like talking to Gemini they llm so I can interrupt it when it's speaking I can have conversations with it but I can't do other tasks like I would with Google assistance so let's just give it a spin with the new wake word which is hey Google let's talk well we couldn't get that working um every time I said Hey Google let's talk the Google Assistant would just go clunk sure I love talking and then it would be end of interaction it wasn't
any kind of continuous conversation mode I really don't think that um I entered the mode I was trying to enter ever and we can't figure out why it's a shame cuz I really would like to check that out I I wish I could you know tell it to read me my new email maybe if I'm driving or I could um send a text message in a way that's more liable and easy easier than the crappy Google I can I can never get it to send an SMS on my phone or my watch I'd like to try that stuff I'd like to ask it what's on my
calendar for this week coming up and stuff like that and maybe you know just have a companion but not today forever alone for battery life claims they are saying 12 hours of listening on these guys and total 48 Hours altogether with the charging case if you have active noise cancelling off which I don't um so having it on you're going to get that cut down to 8 hours on the buds and 30 hours altogether with this if you have active noise cancelling off and you charge it in the case for 5 minutes you
get an hour and a half of music playback and kind of Rapid Fire time here they support Bluetooth 5.4 and Bluetooth LE they also have ingress protection of ip54 which is kind of standard to okay but I will say Samsung raised the bar with having a water protection of seven meaning you could actually submerge them for 30 minutes under a meter of water these do not this this has a ink protection water rating of four which means just splashes don't go swimming don't even wear them in the shower just
you can wear them in the rain and you can sweat them at the gym and that is pretty standard but you know there competition is tight now um it's nice that they do have a a dust protection rating of five six is the highest many earbuds just don't even have a rating there so cool that they have five for codex they don't have any high quality high resolution codex they just have AAC and SBC which is on like every Bluetooth um device so no like app deck um or anything like that overall I really like
these it's cool that they shrank the buds I guess it would have been cool if they also shrank the case a little bit but it's small enough yeah I like these things I would buy them I'm currently rocking some Sony's but these are smaller I mean they're newer too there's definitely more affordable buds on the market but in this kind of tier where you've got airpods and Samsung's Galaxy buds they are a little cheaper coming out at 2 $30 so you can save 20 or 30 bucks compared to those other ones if
you if you like them that's just that's just bonus then it's just like why not icy on the cake thanks for watching guys if you like this video watch our coverage of other buds from nothing cmf if you really want to save money or Samsung cyber truck looking buds um which element are pretty cool and I probably would say are the direct competitors to these
