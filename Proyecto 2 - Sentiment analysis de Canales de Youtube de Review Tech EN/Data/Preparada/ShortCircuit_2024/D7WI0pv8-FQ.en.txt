my new phone arrived I just have to choose it and I got to admit I'm a little scared I don't know what's worse the Android Fanboys who are going to tear me apart for choosing an iPhone or the Apple Fanboys who are going to tear me apart for picking the wrong one in front of me I've got the 16 16 Pro 16 plus and 16 Pro Max and by the end of this one will have replaced my trusty Galaxy Note 9 I already kind of missed my stylist you know I use it as a camera shutter button more often than anything
else so you can use the rear camera and remote trigger but hey I'm not going to need that because across the whole lineup we get Apple's camera slider control button thing that I've heard about but haven't actually gotten a chance to use yet in spite of the fact that a shocking number of people here at the office have already upgraded to these phones dude Andy whipped his out on my recent trip Bella you've already got one you guys are crazy and we'll talk about that but first first let's
decide whether a titanium versus aluminum chassis is worth the additional money not to mention the extra accessories that are included with the promo sorry I'm just kidding they all just come with a standard USBC to USBC cable and a Sim removal tool even though the Pro Models do support usb3 transfer speeds with their type-c port they still only come with a USB 2 capable cable because Apple wants you to spend a bunch of money on a cable I mean Apple wants to say Save the Planet by including less
copper one cable at a time oh wait I didn't bring my 12 Pro so you guys don't know this but I'm actually kind of a closet semi- Apple user already I have a 12 Pro for when I need to take a picture where the quality matters so instead of just a 48 megapix Main shooter and 12 megapix Ultra wide you get a 48 Main 48 Ultra wide and a dedicated 12 megapixel telephoto though it's possible that won't even matter that much to you because the main shooter on the 16 can apparent ly operate in like a pseudo 12
megap telephoto mode with Optical quality digital Zoom whatever that means anyway we've gotten off the point a little bit the camera bump is bigger and thicker and the whole phone is actually a little bit thicker and more importantly is a little heavier it's not a huge deal if I wasn't holding them side by side I wouldn't care but this kind of reinforces my original leanings that I think I want the regular 16 I don't think I'm willing to pay the extra for the phone it took me until now I've
actually had them on for about 10 minutes while I did retakes to notice the thinner pel I totally forgot about it it's nice aluminum titanium don't really feel that different to me am I missing something here there's also a slight size difference too aside from just the bezels yeah oh so there is very very small but you know what that's probably contributing to the difference in the like weighty feeling of it okay not now Siri oh my God stop oh the dynamic Island ha I get to
experience that fresh Joy but I'm probably going to get to that more in the full review over on LTT for now I want to talk about a feature that genuinely excites me and that is the action button it's not strictly speaking new we already saw it on the 15 Pro Series but it's new to the regular 16 meaning this is the cheapest you've been able to get an action button which is essentially just a macro that can be programmed for all kinds of cool things so you pulled to by default but it can
be configured to launch various apps perform a variety of system functions oh my God this menu is terrible just give me a scrollable list what the hell is wrong with you no what do you mean no this is awful no it's pretty I don't care I can't see what the all the options are I have to scroll through the whole goddamn thing okay let's look at what we got here focus camera wait don't I have a don't I have a dedicated camera button okay well whatever I can also use the action button to launch the camera
because I'm into it like that accessibility options that's super cool hold on a second can you can you set it to like double tap and triple tap and long press no oh well um fine I'm going to go with flashlight yeah buddy wait what oh I got to hold it oh you can can you configure it to be a toggle no okay well wait I got to now I got to hold it again okay well progress new across both models though is the camera control I don't know whether to call it button or slider or I'm going to call it interface
so you press it once and it launches the camera press it again boom you've taken a picture that was pretty darn fast was it that much faster than the double click on my Note 9 and then pressing a volume button I don't know but it was definitely fast and it does more than just that I can do a light press ooh that is a really light press and I can adjust my zoom that is why does Apple scroll everything backwards why do they do that does this not feel backwards to you you're like a
lifelong Apple user it's natural you're pushing it away or bringing towards it's left and right it's not away or toward you the bigger issue is that compared to pressing the screen clicking the button causes a little bit more camera Shak so one of our camera guys Andy who already got himself a 16 Pro is like yeah I'm not going to use it I'm just going to use the on screen button wow it really doesn't seem more convenient it would need to be here has anyone talked about the location of this button yet H I
don't know Apple I think you missed the mark by like 2 cm wow I can almost read the LT on that cable tie I could probably find the Easter eggs that incriminated casify on your laptop this is awesome the only problem for selling me a pro is that the regular 16 is also like freaking awesome I don't think I've seen anything yet to convince me to go with the pro so right now we're comparing you know crappy digital Zoom to optical zoom oh dude dude you look like trash but here look
at that glorious okay regular 16 you're making him look too glorious right now stop it that's the rare shiny though Shin it's cuz they're touching they're not touching the point is is that's a lot better enough to spend another couple hundred I don't know especially when you could spend that money on our sponsor debrand what are they featuring today oh it's the new applicator thing for the screen protector okay I saw their videos of this what this pixel this is all pixel stuff uh yeah we don't
have the iPhone on but we do have a pixel and these are so easy that you can  on Pyramid logo at the top and pull tab  right oh buddy swipe wait 5 Seconds remove the tray I peeled the whole thing off am I an idiot oh dude the glass is on it it's so easy I didn't know I successfully did it and this level of perfection can be yours with the prism 2.0 atl.com we're going to have that linked down below both of them support new photographic Styles you can change your I don't know your
undertones yeah I could do that right I'm sure my kids would love this you know one of the other big differentiators for the camera is support for 120 frame per second 4K recording on the Pro Models and one of Apple's justifications for this like why you would ever need that is 120 FPS can actually be perfectly reduced to any other frame rate that you would want to use and I remember having a conversation with one of our old camera guys Brandon like eight years ago I was like yeah we
should just shoot everything at 120 because then we can upload at any frame rate we want and he was like that's the stupidest thing I ever heard lonus you wouldn't get the proper feel during panning shots that you get from like that cinematic 24 frames per second so we're going to put that to the test oh since we're in here this audio mix stuff is kind of cool you can change it to either sound like a standard phone camera or like more like you were in a you know Studio or whatever else did I
say 100 FPS here let's let's play it  25 yeah that's not what I meant by that well I'm sure there's a way to do that and I will either figure that out for the full review or I will not care about it because I don't care about it let's talk about what's under the hood both the pro and non-pro are getting a18 class silicon which is an improvement from last generation where non-pro users got last gen silicon but we're getting an a18 Pro versus a regular a18 the main difference between which seems to be a
slightely more powerful GPU a bit more cache an upgraded display engine as well as image signal processor and video encoder all of which are supposed to contribute to more of those pro video features like that high refresh rate 4K recording I don't know if any of those things are the kind of thing that the average person is likely to miss dayto day although I will say that the differences are starting to add up let's have a look at the screens now let's play a game I'm not going to tell you
which of these phones is which you're not going to look that closely at the bezel okay you're just going to try and tell from the screen wow they look good do you know which one is which if you said this is the pro congratulations you're right but shame on you you're a cheater because to the eye the difference between these is not discernible even Apple's own specs says that they have the same performance when it comes both to Peak brightness and even to sustained brightness and we
recorded the same in our lab for both the non-pro and the Pro Models which I think is a really good thing because it means that content creators can Target One display essentially for this entire generation of iPhones with the only difference being the slight size difference and of course the elephant in the room which is the difference in refresh rate so once again the non-pro does not get a promotion display meaning that it will only run at 60 HZ have you seen the controversy around
the pro where they took a high-speed camera and found that it only ever reaches about 80 HZ instead of the advertised 120 dude it's noticeable do you see that stutter here come come look in person yeah I guess a little bit is it just with the 16 Pro uh do you notice the difference between my 15 Pro and the 16 Pro do you notice the difference between the 15 Pro and the 16 Pro a little bit I'm hoping that's a software thing the good news is that the other standout feature of the display having
always on display does work yeah that's pretty cool and it goes all the way down to one knit which I am a huge fan of because I okay I'm sorry I use my phone late at night in my bed I know I'm not supposed to but at least this is going to make it I don't know less bad let's continue the side by side but this time   that is an incredible amount of Rumble for a tiny little phone speaker Things Fall Apart a little bit once you get past about 80% but that's outstanding okay Pro 
now do you hear that it almost sounds like it has like a bit of subwoofer r Rumble that should be impossible my God these sound good are they vibrating the phone a little bit dude it almost feels like like a little bit of that sensation of bass like H have you heard of the baselet it's like a a wearable device that's supposed to kind of like vibrate your wrist a little bit to make you feel more bass it wasn't that effective but if they're doing something similar on this it's working I
can't to my ears tell the difference between these two they both sound flipping awesome though they both have Wi-Fi 7 so that's a non-factor they both get the ceramic Shield which is apparently Apple's toughest glass ever and it was already freaking amazing they both get satellite messages both outgoing and from a select contact emergency contact incoming and they both have sensors that detect if you've been in an accident and will call 911 I guess the last thing is for me to look at the
ergonomics of the different sizes make a final call here I guess now's a good opportunity to talk about base models and pricing apple is still shipping phones so for the 16 and the 16 plus with 128 GB of storage which is absolutely pathetic in this day and age and then they are charging an obscene amount to get more the pro Max starts at 256 but the regular Pro doesn't it starts at just 128 gigs of storage as well so the amount of money that you're paying to get a pro Max that starts with
256 you're better off buying a lower spec phone and um I guess paying an exorbitant amount for more storage I mean it's no secret why Apple's doing this their customers will pay it and they will then turn around and pay them even more for an iCloud subscription so that they have somewhere to put all of their stuff but it's very frustrating for me and it does make the decision more complicated because I feel like no matter which one I get I'm kind of paying a lot more than I'm really
comfortable with it's not necessarily about whether I can afford it or not it just bothers me like they start over a thousand dollars so what in for a penny in for a pound do I just go pro you can still buy last generation iPhones and they're still G to get like you know five six seven years of software support anyway so that's actually a viable option on the iOS platform I could see why people wouldn't want to upgrade these things very often dude you run into so many people that are like still
using their iPhone 8 or whatever and it's like yeah because the lineup is so confusing now and it's not even that it's confusing it's that it's so expensive weighing these different options against each other it's like stressful they even all kind of look the same on the table in front of me they all got the same ip68 water resistance oh they all have faster wireless charging right Meg safe this will be my first time in the Meg safe ecosystem kind of excited about that half an hour
for 50% charge love that you know what I think I'm going to go with my initial gut feeling 16 plus 256 gig and then anything we left off here I guess we'll cover in the LTT review you know like the video on the real Channel sorry about subscribe to Short Circuit though
