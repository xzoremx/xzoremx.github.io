did I just mangle this did this box have a huge gash in it before I started good thing the Box isn't the important part this video is sponsored by TP link and we're going to be looking at The Deco be1 excuse me I mean The Deco b63 I've been told it's this not this but who cares it's a whole home Wi-Fi 7 mesh system that promises speeds of over 10 gigabit per second which not that long ago I would have said TP Link you can take your lies and take your money and get out of here but Wi-Fi 7 is
freaking amazing to the point where I actually believe that with this system you could probably push 10 gbit per second of networking through it let's talk about that in a moment first let's take a look at what's included in their three pack of these you get three of these little nodes and on the outside we've got a WPS button for quick setup a USB port so you can attach network storage a power Inlet with including power brick which you can't take for granted these days folks and this is
pretty exciting to me okay yeah I'm supposed to focus on the WiFi here but 2 and 1/2 gig networking across the board every one of these has four 2.5 gig ports so if you had something like a high-powered home NZ or um multiple people who want to be able to download games at the maximum speed that their state-of-the-art CPU allows this is going to let them do it and what's cool is that by having having this load out on all of the nodes you're not limited in terms of where you can have these
multiple fast machines that are interacting with each other another really cool technology that tplink "includes with The Deco 10,000 is the" ability to use either wired back haul Wireless back haul or a combination of wired and wireless back haul and when I say back haul what I'm trying to say is only one of these can be connected directly to the internet let's say this one that means that any device that's connected via Wi-Fi to this guy say on the second floor is going to have to
bounce between this unit to this unit to get to the Internet so that can be done over a wire over Wireless or through a combination depending on what's convenient for your install if it's only Wi-Fi it can be pretty problematic although on these I would be a lot less worried about it because they have got though on these I'd be a little less worried about it because they've got some pretty sick Wi-Fi let's get them plugged in and then I'll show you what I mean or rather let's connect one of our
Deco e63s to start while we go through the quick installation guide oh by the way the last thing included is this flat ethernet cable indicator LED on the bottom unconventional okay now I get it you can yeah okay you can kind of see it like I was like really guys you can't see the indicator okay fine I'll allow it the main benefits of Wi-Fi 7 are that it's faster lower latency and allows more devices to be connected concurrently to and achieves this in a number of ways
first of all it uses more sophisticated 4K QAM signaling it uses wider channels up to 320 MHz on the 6 GHz band and oh by the way it uses the new uncongested 6 GHz band which does have some slight drawbacks in terms of range but vastly outperforms the 5 gz and especially 2.4 GHz BS the last thing that's really important and this is supported by the b63 though not all Wi-Fi 7 devices necessarily work with it at least not yet is support for mlo or multi-link operation this allows it even ignoring
the wired connection to use 2.4 5 GHz and 6 GHz at the same time to supported devices for absolutely wild speeds now as you can see administration of your deco mesh system is done through the Android or iOS app so let's go ahead and get it set up mhm M  sure mhm interesting showing up yeah it's just telling me hey do your thing you know and I'm like doing my thing over here and we're all happy connected device yeah let's go connection successful what more could you want everyone wants a successful
connection that was I've got mine stop ion she's not watching this she doesn't need new Wi-Fi and if she did I'd take care of it for her I have my flaws but I I will take care of the Wi-Fi if it's down C SC set here we go done it's detecting my internet connection type I'm going to dial up yo ethernet cable is not connected see Sven told you Belle he told you it wasn't connected let's try that again shall we if you're unsure we did advanced settings oh that's cool you can just
turn ipv on like that it was a bit of a hassle for um electr booms upgrade we had to do some K jiggering in order to get it working create your Wi-Fi network this is a really bad password do not use this look it even tells me it's like yo you're an idiot but they said it really politely oo 6 GHz automatic updates oh wait oh I almost skipped it yeah yeah yes automatic updates please unable to try again it's going to do it this no it's going to do it this time it's going to do it this
time it's going to do it this time it's going to do it this time it's going to do it this time it's going to do it this time it's going to do it this time so basically they lied to me by having no internet in these tubes right here hey My Deco is set up now that I have an internet in my tubes all right all we got to do is power up these other boys well you know what maybe we'll do that another time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay first I want to see what kind of internet speed we can
get out of this one okay no no yeah that that was that was just on The Deco okay okay that freaked me out a little bit I was like wow I mean Wi-Fi 7's really fast but it's not that fast okay cool that means our 2 and 1/2 gig Port is working good now let's test our Wi-Fi speed all right now it's worth noting that we could be limited by the speed of the servers we connect to here but theoretically if we were able to test over the wire at 2.3 GB per second this should be pretty fast oh
that's not really as fast as I that's a little faster hello 850 megabit per second upload uh okay that really that really wasn't that fast am I missing something here ah I wasn't missing something but maybe our pixel 8 was when we turned on mlo performance increased dramatically and when we switched out to a OnePlus 12 it got even better and it's worth noting that that's here in our office where there's a lot of interference from our regular AP so your results may be even better than our own around 1 GB per
second up and down to a single client and that is only a fraction of its power I mean to get the most out of it you want to have multiple clients connected to it okay my daily driver phone probably not going to move the needle but hold on let's see okay this is where you're going to get really even more impressed because I bet these results are going to be basically the same even with two phones hitting it at the same time okay so I'm going to let this one start going I'm going to let it going
and then you're going to see that that is not going to be impacted by this one  out already with just two devices we're "sitting at aggregate of what like 1,200" megabit per second down and like "1,700 up that is freaking" crazy no one else seems impressed TP link they're they're impressed they're like good job lonus you demoed the product yep that's what it does actually it does more than that so let's go ahead and connect a couple more of these units here obviously this is not how I would
recommend setting up a mesh Network you want to have these devices close enough that they are able to wirelessly interface with good signal strength to your base unit and far enough that you're going to get the benefit of devices that are let's say connecting from the second or third story of your house being able to get a stronger signal to to their closest Wi-Fi access point now in an ideal scenario you would actually where' I put that internet cable what you would run wires between your original
one and your satellite ones which would mean that you've got all of your Wi-Fi available for your devices but because these things have so many bands and such wide bands and they can use bands concurrently it is far less of a concern than it used to be the lower latency of m is in my opinion the biggest deal because most of the time I don't need to upload something at 1.4 gigabit per second from my cell phone that's not the key benefit the key benefit is that if there's any congestion it can actually
use one of the other bands to get that packet through so when you're say for example gaming you're going to get a more consistent experience using Wi-Fi 7 of course you're going to need a Wi-Fi 7 enabled client what else is there to talk about in here they've got some convenience features like the ability to set up a separate Network for guests or iot devices uh supports matter actually speaking of iot devices parental control so you can either manage that on a network level or
they have an app that you can install on your kids phones what else are we looking at in here all the usual stuff qos port forwarding oh hey LED control dude you can turn it off at night hey I like that if I've got one of these in my theater room or in my my bedroom or something like that I want it off at night I love that it's $600 regular price for this and we actually have a $50 off coupon you can check that out down below but if you don't live in a three-story building or if you're a
you know small business or something like that you could probably get by with just one of these which I already showed you guys is really flipping fast that's going to cost you $210 and considering you're getting Wi-Fi 7 you're getting the app base setup and everything else that we showed is a lot more palatable and if you're living in honestly apartment even a small detached house you're probably going to get by with that and then you can always go get one more or another one more just don't get
too many we actually did a video recently where we showed what happens if you have too many Wi-Fi access points it's really really bad thanks again to TP for sponsoring this video subscribe to Short Circuit
