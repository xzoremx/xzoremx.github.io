we're here at CES 2024 in the Asus Booth check out their brand new gaming monitors that holy crap look at how pretty she is this right here is the PG 39 wcdm we're going to look at it because Asus sponsored this video almost forgot the disclosure there but I'm not going to forget how freaking good this thing looks this is an OLED panel it's made by LG and it goes up to "1,300 nits now that is only for 3% of" the display but that is pretty typical of this or QD or even some of the less
honest LCDs so you get those like pin points that are so freaking bright on an OLED but you also get those just absolutely perfect blacks oh my God these things look some nice now this one specifically is 39 in there will also be a 34 in version that's essentially the same thing but a a tiny bit smaller as I'm sure you have assumed and it has up to a 240 HZ refresh rate so let's come in here we've got a bit of Rocket League booted up I really like rocket League cuz it's such a vibrant game and it
allows us to really see just how bad I am for one and also just how nice this thing looks the amount of contrast on this thing is just fantastic I feel like rocket League wasn't showing off the like intensity of this display that I was looking for one moment here here we go now you obviously cannot tell how pretty this is cuz you're looking at it through nfx 3 through YouTube and then through your monitor but just like the glint on Buddy's helmet here are so impressive and like the contrast between
him and like his cap oh it is very nice now what you might be thinking is that like this fire r here that's really bright and making things really bright consumes a lot of power and a lot of power creates a lot of heat and OLED displays really do not like that if they are getting too bright they will burn in and they will just start looking bad and die eventually which is why Asus has their brand new heat sink assembly now we talked to them for an hour to try and get permission to take one of these
apart they wouldn't I am very sad about it so we'll have to in the future I was trying to find some marketing BS name for it but instead it's just the high efficient custom heat sink for Effective heat management but what that is doing is that on the scaler and on the power delivery they have heat sinks on there to make sure that no more than about 60Â° C is able to make its way to the panel they also have a massive graphine sheet across the whole thing to make sure that you know she's staying just real nice
and cool maybe you know that's that one's just 240 HZ you don't want that you want 400 80 this right here is the pg27 AQ DP it's 1440p 480 HZ and holy heck buddy in the little spaceship he is completely clear all the way across like at 240 he looks pretty good but the motion Clarity of this guy is absolutely incredible and it can be even better as says they're going to have black frame insertion on these panels although they're pretty Cy about the details and you might be wondering why do you want
that so in the past black frame insertion was used because the pixels were pretty darn slow they were right laggy so they would strobe the backlight so that as the pixel is like you know changing from one color to the next you wouldn't see that and you wouldn't get those smearing effects these days though that isn't a problem cuz OLED pixels are just they're right fast the problem though is your own eyeballs and just their analog image persistence so if there's like an image on the display and
it moves your brain and eyes kind of think of it as one thing whereas if you put a little black frame in there your eyes are like oh it's new information every single time that it does that and it can look absolutely fantastic now these do support free sync although they didn't say if it supports g-sync because it is currently going through validation although it might be safe to say it will in the future but we're not going to look at that now in the past a lot of the time if you have a 480 HZ panel it
will look really good in games and pretty poo poo in everything else cuz they will sacrifice everything for that pixel response time not the case here this thing also has the 1300 nit Peak brightness 99% DC ip3 coverage and it just looks very very nice isus said that for this generation they had to completely redo how they calibrate their OLED panels because for one it's just very different than LCD but also these things are so hecking bright they had to just well they don't have very many
details about it cuz you know these aren't out yet they don't want to give away too much but uh according to my eyeballs they did a very good job oh maybe you're super indecisive do want want 480 HZ do I want 240 HZ you can have both right here so right here is the PG 32 ucdp this also has that LG panel that is OLED 1300 nits but this one right here can be either 4K 240 HZ or full HD 480 HZ there also will be the Rog PG 32 ucdm so same thing except this one has a p but that one right there will have a
"QD OLED and it will be only up to 1,000" nits and like you know Samsung's panels are they even that good anymore now that we have these oleds I was hoping the Asus reps would get mad at me but they I guess just agree that the LG ones are really fantastic technically in every way this panel is better now the same Samsung will have the advantage that it's going to be launching this month which will be sooner than the rest of them which will be more like Lake q1 maybe early Q2 somewhere around there
and uh it kind of shows so this guy right here currently does not have the working dual mode so unfortunately we cannot play around with that but I know what a lot of you guys might be thinking is just like why why would you want those why not just pick one and they basically said well we can do 480 HZ but you cannot even drive that even with like a 4080 4K 480 HZ it is not going to happen so if you do some Esports titles and they like sometimes do content creation or just like want to look at
text that's really nice and clear that's where that 4K is really going to come into its own now one pain point of monitors is always just using a little OSD in the monitor huge pain in the ARs so Asus has had this before many companies had this before but they have a new and improved OSD within Windows this allows you to do fun things like change the brightness will it actually work oh my God it actually worked this is all pre-production so I wasn't 100% sure but almost more importantly is
their OLED tear stuff so of course LG within the firmware of the panel makes sure that it's not going to burn in too much but if you want to just be a little bit more careful you can come in here they've got display saver adjusting logo brightness to make sure that just like you don't have your windows logo end up on your screen at all times or you can manually Force the pixel cleaning what happens if I click that don't do it pixel cleaning fail well it tried now we don't have final pricing for any of
these although they did say that the 34in version of the PG 34w CDM is going to be around "$1,300 which when you compare it to" something like the QD OLED monitors that exists right now is pretty good but it firmly puts you in like Nicholas plof Ultra display nerd territory and not sort of more like Normy display territory and I was kind of wondering like normally you get this new Ultra like yeah it's the most beautiful display you can get but we haven't really seen oleds trickle down at all
and like and what once was premium like 3 years ago it doesn't exist as a midlevel device these day you just keep on refreshing the most expensive of those and Asus was saying that there is a good reason for that and that's mostly just that OLED customers do not want to compromise on the image quality at all and there have been other companies that had less bright OLED panels that were returned to them because the customers were not very happy with the brightness and the performance compared to their
old LCD ones so they could do stuff like remove that really expensive custom heat sink from these but then they either have to really drop down the brightness or you just have to live with with a bunch of burning which I don't think any of us want so this right here as economies of scale and stuff start happening might get a little bit cheaper but for now it's just for the ultra nerds that said though the ultr Nerds are getting some really beautiful displays just like it was really
beautiful that Asus sponsored this video hit like get subscribed and just have a fantastic old day
