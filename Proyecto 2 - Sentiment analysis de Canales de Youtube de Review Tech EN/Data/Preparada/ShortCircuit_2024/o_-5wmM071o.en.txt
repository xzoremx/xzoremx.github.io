there's a lot of Buzz about these cmf buds Pro two from nothing's budget brand cmf because they're so dang cheap so we're going to find out if there's any reason to pay more I mean 3 through 50 for the kind of Flagship buds from the major brands could these be that much worse first thing you notice a fun color it comes in multiple colors I probably wouldn't choose the blue but it's nice to have these options and there they are inside too more comments on those after we look at what else it comes with cable
USB a to type c interesting choice not C to c i you know that's probably philosophical on the one hand you're like come on get on the bus it's a USBC future USBC everything but on the other hand there's lots of a ports around still so it's probably just going to depend on you and what you have laying around does your laptop have an a port this is really short and there's no adapter but you know what it's a budget product so okay we do got ear tips and there's some instructions in there too
how many sizes of ear tips do we get they are silicone which I would expect and you get the size that's on the bud which looks like Medium as well as a smaller and a larger and they match the color that you bought the buds themselves glossy hard plastic injection molded stem design they're only glossy on this part the stem is actually matte there's some symbols on here I don't know what they mean these pop off yep normal kind of standard there's three microphones on each one we will do a mic test later
there's a little dot up here that could potentially be a mic there's one over here where that looks a little bigger it might be a vent for the drivers but for sure these two dots at the end of the stems are going to be two out of your three mics there's two drivers actually there's a bigger one and a small one it's 11 mm driver and then a 6 mm driver and we're going to see how they sound later on kind of cool how they fit in there kind of just flip on top like that magnetic kind of looks like it's
agnostic but it ain't not only does it not close properly if you screw it up but you can see that the Pogo pins won't align because they're on the inside of the stem and right there and when you put the wrong stem on there they are just not aligned they're rotated off by like 50Â° or something is there an indicator on the stem of which one's the right side usually nothing does like a big red dot but on here they look identical it's a square design USBC charging has a indicator
light on it for pairing and stuff what's unique about the case is that it actually has this control on it this dial satisfyingly tactile it spins infinitely in either direction why do I need this there's always some false negatives when you're trying to deal with the buttons on an earphone you click it it doesn't work I have to click it again and then it turns out to be a double click next song sucks so maybe this is a godsend let's get these in my ear holes pretty good seal
I'm getting a decent amount of passive isolation my voice sounds different to me things seem a little quieter out here this is what they look like oh I think that wasn't passive isolation I think that was active noise cancelling I pulled it out and everything changed James's famous Shake test they I mean they're really in there IP rating though I would say the standard IP rating for truly wireless earbuds is usually IP X4 which means that the X means they did not test it or get a
rating for ingress protection of dust and debris uh and then the four would be splashes and stuff these are 55 which is pretty good I'd like to see 65 cuz there's lots of devices that have the six the highest rating for dust but it's nice that they have a rating at all and then for the five water protection normally with a four you're just saying hey that's that's going to be good for like sweat at the gym and I guess you could wear them in the rain like you would hope but the five gets you like
sprays from any angle sprays of water for 3 minutes so I mean you could probably get away with wearing these in the shower unless you like freaking really were shooting at them for your whole shower your shower I kind of wanted to wear them in the shower the other day man I was I was like I don't have a lot of time and I love listening to a podcast or something with that found time you know when you're washing dishes and stuff like that might be nice something I really care about with my
earphones is the interface and messing with that stuff is typically when I like to listen to them for the first time so we'll do all that right after this message from our sponsor thanks to Corsair for sponsoring this video the allnew K65 Plus Wireless is a 7 5% keyboard designed to free up desk space allowing for more Mouse movement it features prebe Corsair mlx red linear switches for a silky smooth responsive key press cor are also included two layers of sound happening to reduce
unwanted Clacks and pings and with the K65 Plus Wireless you'll get up to 266 hours on a single charge with that kind of battery life you could speedrun portal "2,660 times before the keyboard dies" learn more about the K65 Plus Wireless using the link in the description all right nothing X start I've actually never really seen this before it had issues pairing automatically and then it has this kind of troubleshooting flow now where I can choose which earphone I'm having trouble pairing and it's this
one and now wow I don't need this it gives me the instructions right here open the case without removing the buds which I did locate the button inside the case and hold it for two seconds that little can you even see how discreet this little button is yes I see it how does it know they're blue is that a happy accident super slick interface all right we're connected and I got my battery level for each earbud right there got a cool visualization smart dial I'm interested in this feature set up smart
dial for more features let's try it oh this is the Smart dial when I read smart dial I thought it was a way to dial people's numbers smartly so you can actually get a press a double press a triple press a press and hold and the rotate and looks like by default there's just no action and it's nice that that's an option because it's kind of sensitive this could go off in your pocket and that would suck let's see what options you have for each one of these starting with the rotate which
I think is the most interesting okay it's volume or nothing what about seek  iPod what the hell why can't I do anything okay well I can't edit any these I don't know why maybe it needs to be playing music first okay I got these in now let's try this again oh cool I can just select the earbud controls or the smart doll controls earbud controls I can choose right or left I can make them different wow this is like so so many options I like that you can really customize this transparency
control you can choose whether or not it rotates through off which is dope double tap and hold is the only one that exposes volume I will make it up on the right and down on the left okay I could change those can I change this now I can what was the difference I put them in my ear maybe it was bugging out before maybe you need to have them in your ear I don't know you can make it turn on low lag mode on and off which is cool oh look at that you can actually have chat GPT as your voice assistant
which is pretty cool I believe that is only supported on specific nothing phones and it looks like you have to have it installed too I wish wish that was a link that I can just go and install it uh I want to try that so I'm going to get that now okay that appears to be set up now I think maybe I'll close the app launch it again I did see this pop up before but it got dismissed but it's here again which is good enabling seamless interaction with chat GPT as a custom voice AI while on the Move let's try it
chat GPT is there now finally let's listen to these things whoa these are base heavy holy cow all Al they seem to be like blasting right now let's try turn it down okay this is kind of annoying there is a volume sound like boop boop boop with each step but there's a lag in the volume sound so if I go like it only makes one Boop sound even though I went like 10 steps and that Boop sound is like pretty delayed so it's kind of bizarre holy cow is this the is this the default curve this is not space I some
people are really going to like this but this is like definitely overcooked compared to what the artist intended I should note now that these have direct optio on them and dur obviously comes from the home theater space you can get an AVR that has dra room correction on it and they are respected brand in that space they know what they're doing this product is to help optimize sound using high resolution filters in headphones and in your car in other products they allow a brand to Simply use dra's own
Target curve curve or the brand own Target curve and in this case I'm pretty sure they're using the Brand's Target curve because this is far from accurate that's not to say you don't like it you know different strokes but it ain't flat man how loud does this go way loud I don't even want to go all the way yeah this is going to hurt me that's for sure let's see how the volume works on here okay it worked but it was pretty slow I didn't think it was going to work  this is just straight up not working
that's why they have the dial cuz the interface sucks on the buds yeah this interface sucks it appears that the top of the stem is is really where the read is yeah right here this from here up you're you're better off let's check out some EQ options in the app equalizer whoa they got the dra one right there and then here's custom they do give you the plus 6 DB I mean honestly with the base turned all the way down it's still normal when you crank it it is thumpy I wish it showed those dials when
you're on these other ones so you could get a sense of where they are but I expect that especially the optio one is probably tuned with a lot more granularity than those dots that we get exposed to in custom oh they do give you a little Cloud for the other ones interestingly you can switch between these so quickly but when you go to opio it takes longer and actually interrupts the music for a second I love this song it's got a really good flam I love a good flam you know what that is it's
when you take both drumsticks you make them a little offset and then you hit the drum with it so they go yeah this much bass is just not right for metal but they really dancable they sound great putting you in rock mode really made it crunchier oh I don't like this Rocky Q check out the delay on this  the music is starting even later than you can see the visualization go it's like music's playing now stop let's talk battery life claims they got 60 Milah hours on the buds and
460 Mah hours in the case that'll net you 43 hours of play back with no a ANC on with including you know charging it through the case which is 11 hours on the buds themselves however I almost always use a andc and that will net me 6 and 1/2 hours on the buz and 26 uh all told 10 minutes of charging gets you 3 hours no ANC or 1.8 hours do that conversion to minutes yourself with ANC I'm not in a great environment to assess the quality of the ANC what I can say is it sounds normal
you know it's kind of table Stakes on a lot of earbuds now I mean these These are 60 bucks and they have them and they have this chat GPT thing which is interesting to me and I want to try just very briefly it seems like it just launches the app I'm not hearing anything in my ears at all it's just telling me there that I can't have chat GPT on when I hold down this but a different assistant when I hold down that it's one assistant for all let's  happens yeah apparently the assistant
button just launches the whatever assistant on your phone and does nothing in the buds uh not sure what's up with that okay I did hear it say here's what I found on the web in the buds but it never went like what's up or like boink or anything like that hello how are you I'm great thanks for asking I can hear it but like there's there's no way to know that it's even listening that is unfortunate I don't expect that to be normal I'm assuming there's something wrong right now with our setup or our
firmware or it's a bug de fix it's not working right now um overall take on these things 60 bucks or 90 Canadian these are really great value the build quality is cool the sound quality is not bad at all it's definitely good enough for vast majority of people um the case has some cool features it just doesn't seem like you're compromising very much for this low price and I think that others are going to struggle to compete with these definitely worth at least investigating if you're shopping for
earbuds especially I mean even if you're trying to pay more maybe you should just take a look at these save your money thanks for watching guys if you like this video why not check out our other unboxings of other products from nothing they've got the nothing buds and the buds a which are the cheaper ones but not as cheap as these
