great cable management is pretty hard it takes a lot of time and a lot of cable ties and even if you get it looking nice it's a lot of work to make adjustments but that ends today with the  system in front of me is everything you can get from the cable management system first up is the small Arch kit it comes with five arches and is commonly used for single cable runs or small cable runs second is the medium Arch kit it comes with three arches and they are a little bit bigger to let you accompany a
few more cables or some larger cables moving to some of the bigger ones the large Arch kit it comes with two and they're more for bundling multiple power cables or a number of ethernet runs and the final of the Arches the big one the extra large these can hold a ton of weight every Arch kit you order will also come with its own plate set that has the number of plates you need plus some screws to mount it we also offer a VHB kit or we offer a silicone kit as well let's see how and when you'd use

your desk we've found that about 1T spe facing is good to keep cables taut on the underside of a desk once you get your layout grab your standard plates peel off the backing and hold for about 3 or 4 seconds after that grab a screw and screw it in if you got the VHB upgrade kit grab some isopropyl alcohol or other Degreaser and wipe down the area that you're going to apply the plates to let it dry PE off the backing you're going to want to hold it for about 10 seconds do make sure
that this is where you want it cuz it is permanent once it's attached if you got a silicone upgrade kit there are two common uses one is for applying it on top of one of your existing plates to give you a little bit more stick in terms of sliding alternatively you can apply it to the side of a standit desk or a PC case or anything else that's made out of a magnetic metal if you are using the silicone the magnets won't  well but they'll stay in place better and it helps minimize the chance of
scratching anything that you put them on now we're going to move on to the less intuitive parts of the cable management system the power brick holder comes in a set of two there are your two holders with your power brake holder you get some extra long cable ties these are designed to give you enough room to fit all the way around even the biggest of power bricks when getting ready to use your power bar holder grab your cable tie and slide it into the holder just like that once your two cable ties are 
up if your power brick is something a fair bit smaller you want to line it up so one side is wrapping around it then you can wrap the other side around the cable one other thing I find Handy if you're taking this on the go you can wrap up a bunch of your extra cable in  tie if you're wrapping this around something really small you'll end up with too much cable tie and it won't be able to stick properly if that's the case grab a pair of scissors and cut off the extra the power bar key in my
opinion is one of the most versatile things in the entire offering it's also a set of two it has three pieces you unscrew it and out pops a little gripper that slides into a keyhole slot on a variety of different products when you're attaching this to a power bar you want to unscrew it slide it into the hole and then pull it to one side and  and it's attached almost every Power bar will have two attachment points and that's to stop it from rotating so let's get the second one in and
then this mount it up and these magnets are plenty strong if your Keyhole slot is really deep you can take off the thumb tab entirely to get a little bit of extra reach but if it's really shallow you can flip it over and it'll take up a little  in addition to that if you unthread it all the way the inside thread is a/4 20 for all of your hacking needs like your own 3D printed Creations here we have a hanger and an Electronics enclosure that's wall mounted and some other things for inspiration camera
mounts and we attached our battery charger to the underside of our Shelf how convenient and for the cable tie holder has a nice little cut to be able to slide a cable tie through and either run one cable along it or attach a bunch of things and you get four with your cable tie holder set comes some of our standard cable ties but a set of four just the number you need one of the reasons that you might want to use the cable tie holder over some of the other arches is it's in line with your cables
which means you don't need a lot of space beside them however you do give up some flexibility in terms of ease of replacement for using these another way you can do it if you know you're going to be detaching more than one cable at a time from it so you can wrap the cable tie around it first peel it back a bit and slide this  through the cable tie holders also give you a fair bit of flexibility for attaching ornaments or whatever else you want to with the cable ties we're really
