this is a pixel 9 and this is a 9 Pro XL and this is a pixel 7 nonpr that I've been running for 2 years I want to see if it's worth trading this puppy in and getting a couple hundred off the price of one of these new ones and to evaluate whether it's worth it I'm going to do all the demos that they showed on the keynote to see if these features are actually cool cuz it is actually pretty exciting to think that I could have Scarlett Johansson her level AI in the palm of my hand some of the Computing
happening on device and wow these are some goodl looking phones this is the winter green this is the porcelain there's a bunch of other cool colors notably the pink and as for what's in the box on the lid side you get a sim removal tool papers and under the phones which I really want to look at but I'm restraining myself a simple ctoc charging cable you're not going to get a charger in the box we're all used to that now but it should be noted that this pixel generation uses a 45 WT
charger which is not a lot of Watts lots of other phones are using 65 or even like a 100 in some of these crazy cases however 45 is high for this uh series of phones which have historically used 30 WS we'll get more into the fast charging and battery life specs later on in the video the first thing I noticed about the industrial design on the back side is this kind of pill-shaped visor now mine went all the way across this one this one's cut and rounded and it's super sharp this direction it's just
like a 90 it's obviously a a huge camera bump but it's not that offensive because it does go across the whole device I think that is better because it's it's flat on the table instead of Rocky that's better than just being half the phone in terms of the difference between the two on the exterior you've got these polished metal rails on the pro as well as a soft touch matte back which is a lot less sweaty feeling than the glass back on the non-pro I don't like glass backs this thing is going to slip out of
your pocket so fast when you sit down in the movie theater that's why I recommend getting a skin if you're not going to do a full case looking at the visors another difference between these phones is the number of cameras they each have the same main shooter and Ultra wides however the pro version also has a 5x telephoto and you can also see a temperature sensor over here we'll talk more about the telephoto and other cameras later flipping them around to the front wow these look like iPhones
here's an iPhone 15 Pro see how it rocks super rounded kind of the same proportions it's just really iphony to me my last one was much more square and Samsung they both are OLED screens but this one is an ltpo screen so instead of it just being 60 to 100 Hertz variable refresh rate like the non-pro it can do down to just a single HT it's also brighter than the non-pro and our testing actually did confirm the claimed brightness spec another upgrade that's common to both of
these phones is the fingerprint sensor it is no longer an optical sensor it is an ultrasonic sensor which is going to be better for many reasons they're claiming 50% faster as well as it has an 8 mm x 8 mm sensor which is larger now so it should be more consistent and it won't blind you at night time because it doesn't have to shine a light to read your fingerprint the fingerprint reader on this thing sucked to this day it stinks I've had this thing for over 2 years and I still have to go fail fail fail
just enter your pattern all the time let's see how reliable this one is wow it just worked that was fast too now that the phone's unlocked we're going to try out all of the cool AI features that look exciting but maybe are just gimmicks right after this message from our sponsor dbrand they sent over one of their grip cases for the pixel 9 Pro XL and I would be very scared even though I like running my phone naked well if you don't count a skin if I was going to spend the big money on this
thing I would probably get a case like this especially since it's flattens it out so the visor is no longer a bump that honestly is a big Improvement oddly enough though the case is actually thicker at the top oh it gets wider at the top to protect the camera if you look at it this way you can see the lip along here widens over here so that if it falls like this it doesn't fall directly on the camera the uh buttons are so tacked off it's got punch outs for the mics and for the speakers
and the ports imagine you have to take the case off to charge uh no you don't have to do that it's a durable and grippy case thing just Glu to your hand and see that symbol inside that means mag safe for the front side they do have screen protectors on offer as well so check out short lin.com and yes I can say that I'm 5 fo9 okay for all my demos I want to do them on the non-pro because I figure if they work with this thing with 12 GB of RAM surely it'll work with this thing and it's 16 GB of RAM holy
Apple give people Ram I'm really excited for the new ad me feature so you just scroll over to it in the camera app and now I give this to my friend to take a  me and now we can see the results there we are I mean your arm is gone what is that mixed results I guess I wonder if I could gener to fill that in though that's another part of this whole package they had magic eraser before now they have magic editor Edit Magic editor button please back up this photo use magic oh they're always trying to get
you to back up those  go reimagine as he's got a long sleeve shirt on whoa basically looks like there's a cushion there's like they added a cushion to your hand which actually is an improvement it's nonsensical but at least it's not like a gaping hole oh actually I just just going to erase even more of you wa here we go what I chose to erase the hole and it filled the hole with something that looks more like an arm that's actually the best one yet oh look at this zany picture of lus let's just edit this
without his permission using AI so I have this cool reimagine thing where you can just I don't know select the background oh it's kind of a whack background to choose there we go that's pretty good we'll reimagine that to be space full of stars and Nebula look at that there's lonus in space with like an ironing board behind his head or something so much room for creativity pixel screenshots is an app but now there's AI features we can turn on search your screenshots with on device
AI let's do it cuz man it can be hard to find an old screenshot of like a receipt or something now I'm going to search for a screenshot and I'm going to say how long does it take your passport to be renewed and there it is I mean not a really super hard task since it has the word passport right in the image but let's see if I can do it based on another thing like show me a screenshot that is white couldn't do it black text  background couldn't do it got some limitations let's try the next thing in
keep there's now this magic list function here it's saying help me create a list create a shopping list for a keto friendly cheesecake except don't include cream cheese cuz I already have a bunch in my fridge here it is keto cheesecake shopping list no cream cheese I am not keto currently but I have been in the past and I've made a lot of cheesecakes and I can confirm this looks realistic enough but what about how much I need of each thing kind of a gap another AI feature is clear calling so we're going
to see how the person using the pixel sounds when they are vacuuming so why don't you take the phone and the vacuum Jake Bel yes sir and I'll take your iPhone fine vacuuming outside just vacuuming the sidewalk you're vacuuming right now I'm vacuuming right now I'm going to stop  it I still can you hear me vacuuming no not at all I'm vacuuming that is actually an awesome that's amazing compare that to this other recording where it's off I'm talking R's talking in the vacuum in Google did announce
another feature called call notes that I wanted to try you would get to it but during a call by hitting the more button uh and pressing the button right there for it but it's not available it might be because we're in Canada but unfortunately we can't use it it doesn't just transcribe your call it actually gives a summary so for that call it would have said something like Jake is vacuuming and describes the quality of the call to James something like that this is actually a feature that iOS 18
is going to have as well so those of you on the beta might be using it already I would love to show you but I'm thy next I want to see how sweet the video quality is when I'm zoomed into to 5x on the pro model so let's hit a video let's look at these beautiful gentlemen over here boom I'm zoomed in now I did get a toast that came up and said that frame rate was reduced when I was super zoomed and you can definitely see a lot of Jitter in the viewfinder as I moved around it's
actually super whack and I'm hoping it doesn't appear in the final video so let's check all right here it is and the Jitter is definitely still in the final video there's another thing I a try called video boost where you send the processing of a video off to Google servers for some time and it makes a lot of things better including the clarity of 20x videos so let's zoom into Jake  face and processing is finally done and it's way better it's not perfect but it is way better also here's a bunch of
photos taken with both phones and in pixel tradition they look great one of the the design changes they had this time around was a large Vapor chamber to help cool the phone and it turns out that doesn't make a difference whether you get a large Pro or just a smaller non-pro because both these phones performed almost identically in genjin Impact getting 46 average FPS and 45 average FPS and even the 1% lows were within one frame of each other at 40 and 39 not a stunning result would like to
get 60 the game was on a high preset and the tensor G4 is not really a game gaming optimized chip so if you're a huge gamer this might not be the phone for you as for battery tests we did not do a battery longevity test but what we did do is a how long does it take to charge test we did lots of those it basically 30 minutes will get you 50% battery on either of these phones despite them having different battery sizes and it takes about an hour and a half to get 100% note though that that
is with a 30 wat charger and as I said before these are available with 45 WT Chargers so expect those times to be significantly shorter if you do opt to buy a larger charging adapter or wall wart now let's talk price and worth the cheapest one is 800 bucks to go to the pro it's another 200 bucks at "1,000 to go up in size an additional" $100 for "$1,100 now the thing that makes it" difficult to assess the value of this phone this phone that is marketed as being an AI phone is two things number
one I can get the Gemini app on my old pixel how many of these cool features that I want this phone because of are going to be trickling down to my phone or maybe I can even do now definitely some of them and the second thing is that some of these new AI features you're going to need to have a premium Gemini AI Google One account which the Pro Models do come with a year of for free free I don't know which features require that that subscription and I don't know how sticky they'll get by the
time that free trial expires such that I'm very disappointed and really feel compelled to keep paying a subscription I don't want to pay a subscription and so that just makes it really hard to assess whether you need to upgrade at all and if you do do you need to have the subscription I don't know you guys just wait till you break your screen I guess as always but let's say you do upgrade should you get the pro or the regular one I mean the decision to get the larger screen that's just up to you
do you want a big phone 100 bucks but Pro versus non-pro that's coming down to more RAM the 5x telephoto slightly different industrial design brighter screen if you're out Outdoors a lot selfie Cam that says more megapixels on the pro it's tough you guys why don't you let me know in the comments whether you think that $200 Delta is worth it in this case why you're at it why don't you watch our video on the Samsung s24 I mean you'd be remiss if you didn't at least look at that phone if you're in the
market for one of these right
