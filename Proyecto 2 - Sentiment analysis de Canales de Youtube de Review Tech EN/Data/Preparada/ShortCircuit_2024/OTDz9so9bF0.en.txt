here at CES 2024 where the cars just keep on getting weirder starting with the Honda series zero Saloon this thing right here looks absolutely sick it's like if you took a Kos and a minivan and put them together and just got the best bits of both of them and for those of us that want actual van they have the space Hub which holy heck this thing looks cool and holy heck that is a duster and a half Honda has the new space Hub which oh my God it looks cool well maybe you had to park a little bit too far away
from your destination which is where the new Moto compacto comes in I actually really want to try out one of these cuz "they're only 1,000 bucks if you want one" Lexus also collabed with Razer to put RGB on their car cuz you know they can't make a good electric one
