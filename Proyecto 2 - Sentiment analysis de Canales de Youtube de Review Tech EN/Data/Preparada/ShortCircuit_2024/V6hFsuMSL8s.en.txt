the dream of the next Doc is alive the dream that I'm talking about is the dream to use your phone as your computer I've covered a few NEX docks on short circuit and LTT over the years and they have a new one now it's the NEX do XL if you're unaware the next do is a laptop like Bare Bones kit there's no computer in here per se you're supposed to connect your phone or anything else that has HD Mi output and use it as a monitor slash keyboard trackpad touchcreen so we're going to get all into that first I
want to see what's in the box here so you got your charging and connection guide they're still making things with mini HDMI I actually didn't know that but you get a HDMI to Mini HDMI cord that looks about what 3T 4T there is a o like a flat USB typc Toc and it has 20 gbits per second printed on it you've also got a longer us BC Toc this is a 45w power adapter to charge the 49w hour battery inside the laptop itself and then you also have a region adapter for I think this is Europe right here I'm
holding Europe in my hands and Korea they also like regulation I like the brushed Metal finish on here bit fingerprint but I also have hair product on my hands which is just something to keep in mind um we might as well look at the ports while we're here though on this side we've got the power button a Micro SD card slot and a usba a port and a headphone jack on the other side we've got two USBC ports and the mini HDMI port now that one is used for display in obviously oh I should also say you don't
need to use the wired connection uh to control the keyboard and trackpad because this also supports Wireless like the last version okay let's open her up I'm I'm actually excited yeah it's very stiff hinge wow that is a completely different layout keyboard on the left trackpad on the right you either like it or you don't I think that it's okay first questions okay my biggest complaints about the last next do were the keyboard Flex ooh ooh next do you listen to me I feel so heard thank you
clickiness of the keys very nice tactile bump up here I believe is a wireless charging pad for your phone which is why you need this magnetic uh Circle ooh yeah cuz like that's where I put it okay let's see if I just eyeballed it is that will it do it okay so you can just eyeball it and it seems like it'll charge nice okay let's complete the hardware tour here just like last time it's got a nice you know sturdy hinge it'll stay pretty much at whatever angle you want there's a little
bit of wobble to it and yeah you can go all the way around and use it like that if you want okay we're going to plug something something in and we're going to see if the phone as a PC dream lives on after this message from our sponsor but sometimes you need a little bit more than just a laptop to get your real work done that's why I have made the brand new and super versatile LTT laptop bag it features a padded micro suede laptop holder which just feels so soft and also
has loads of pockets and Loops designed specifically for your charger your mouse and all of your other accessories adapters and CA this is all in a bag that's not much bigger than a sleeve or smaller than many that I have seen it even comes with detachable shoulder and Luggage straps that you can easily tuck away check it out now on LTT store.com so like I said before you can connect pretty much anything with a display out to this machine a phone another Windows device if you want a second monitor some
of these new gaming handhelds so you have a bigger screen for your steam deck or your windows based handheld or whatever but for today's video I'm going to use a Samsung Galaxy alal s23 Ultra you can use a USBC cable you can connect wirelessly via mirrorcast I believe it is and then Bluetooth for the touchpad and the keyboard and you can also swipe down here with two fingers to show settings nice and there's the display information right there we're running at 1080p display at 60 HZ I believe 60 HZ
is only going to be over wired and wireless is going to be 30 I'm going to do wireless first all right so wireless display but I can use a touchpad on the phone yeah okay we're in the trackpad is working it is very choppy but you know this is why I want to do wireless first most of the time if you have your phone right here you might as well plug it in but I guess they're like you know maybe if you're if your if your cabl being buggy or something there's always the option to
use wireless as a fallback I can't see the freaking cursor jeez that's annoying I can already give my verdict on the trackpad the wireless connection for the trackpad is not usable I'm sorry I'm sorry next do I wonder if it's any better if I use the phone as a as a touchpad Samsung should have thought about this that I have Sticky Fingers I'm constantly stealing things nobody said that the phone is a PC thing would be great okay let's get wired dude yes yes and ooh oh that Mouse feels so much
better honestly if the background if the default background wasn't like super dark I wouldn't be so frustrated right now but I literally when the cursor is over here I literally just the cursor is right here right now you can't see it so there's stuff there's there's cursor settings in in the Samsung settings but not for decks this is not a video about decks regardless of my frustrations with like decks and the kind of just ease of use things that they still have to add
the touchpad is leagues better than the last one there was a big problem with ghost touches maybe because it's over on the right side now so maybe that was a big reason why they moved it over I don't know regardless that problem is uh largely fixed keyboard is very responsive and I honestly like this keyboard it's clicky it's tactile it's responsive what else do you want and it doesn't Flex you know it it again it says nothing about next do but it says something about this
dream that I'm still I still believe in there was another ghost touch there was another ghost touch the ghost touches are still there please upgrade the trackpad please please please please I am like a Believer I want to go and plug my phone into a lapt and use it as my computer there will be a previous there will be a video sometime in the future where we make this work by sheer force of will there's a there's a shortcut to go to the multitasking menu but I I I they were the shortcuts were bad so I
didn't remember what they were um maybe it freaked out because I I you know switched the audio out put what is this where are we what that's an ad I go to YouTube I search crab Rave I get this is an ad and then the search results and then another huge ad all right we're back we're back show me what you got please yep turning it up and down on the  dock okay okay all right based on my very subjective uh analysis comparing that to my memory of how it sounded the last time I remember saying last time
that the speakers were not good my immediate reaction to these is not that they're not good they're not great but they're fine they sound like more powerful phone speakers maybe you know you're not going to be like powering a house party with with the Vibes with the with the with the jams coming from your lap dock accessory okay so like I said it's a 1080p display uh it's running at 60 HZ over the wired connection according to NEX do it only gets up to 300 nits so I find myself in a similar
situation uh with the NEX do XL here that I was uh with the NEX do wireless and the model before that which is that it's still cool it's still inspiring it's still something that I want deep inside myself that came out wrong this is a imperfect way to realize this dream it is encouraging to see the changes that NEX stock has made particularly to the keyboard it's less flexy it's it's a tactile it's nice to type on ghosting issue is still there sometimes you move the the cursor around
and then you accidentally touch it and it just jumps to the other side of the of the screen I also didn't say in the beginning of the video that it feels heftier it feels less like kind of just a plastic shell and more like there's something in there uh which is the battery which is another unfortunate aspect of this they quoted at 7 plus hours of battery life which is disappointing there's no computer in here to suck battery life so I'm not sure what's what's going on there it's
only a 49w hour battery so next dock please upgrade the touchpad model put a bigger battery in there normal next do wireless 13in version is $300 this one is 329 330 all in all it's nice to see them drop the price a little bit and make it a little bit more affordable make that argument for getting one of these and using your phone or another device instead of like a Chromebook a bit more compelling please keep going next stock please early adopters enthusiasts if you're into this dream as I am pick one
up Tinker around everyone else should probably not buy this but it's for it's for the faithful we can do this we can do this together and you can subscribe to short circuit for more videos like this one if you're interested in watching another video uh which I think you are uh watch my last next do video
