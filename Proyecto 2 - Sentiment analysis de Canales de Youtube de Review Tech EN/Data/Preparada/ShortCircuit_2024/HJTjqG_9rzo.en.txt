swing it's a blade and AMD has sponsored this video to have a look at it there we go as is expected razer's packaging is very nice and it's even a bit green now go green with razor soy ink eco-friendly nature I guess it's  can there we go for gamers by Gamers oh wow all right let's have a look here plug it in turn it on oh and it has a webcam switch I really like those it's the rules you include stickers they go on everyone has to comply business team not happy right now oh wait I went and
grab my microfiber cloth cuz I got fingerprints on it but they also include a microfiber claw this does seem pretty necessary as an inclusion as well cuz even though this matte black finish does look really cool it also is a massive fingerprint magnet which is a bit too bad now for a 14-in laptop the iio on this is actually pretty decent so on the right hand side we have Thunderbolt 4 wait no no no USB 4 which is basically the same thing but this is an AMD laptop USB type a full sizee HDMI 2.1 other
side we have headphone microphone combo Jack another USB 4 full size type A and that's where we plug in our power adapter I know it's fully expected with Razer laptop but dang it does feel good like Twisted it here this new razor blade has has titanium inside of it to make it extra extra stiff and yep that's that's a really really stiff laptop I am not surprised in the slightest Razer has been making really really high quality chassis for a long time much longer than basically every other windows OEM one
thing that I just noticed that I really like is that even though they do have this stupid sticker right here that tells you all of the stuff there's a little tab so oh all of that's gone love it there's nothing course and you have one of those great big stickers right here and it it just never comes all the way off do we do it yeah yeah first thing I can see easily is that this display is fantastic it's 240 HZ so gaming on it going to be great and also it is it's not 1440p it's 1600p so
that's the 16 by10 version of 1440p which is absolutely perfect for a laptop like this I love it so much that laptop makers have moved towards 16x 10 "displays that are," 1600p high refresh rate it is incredible and also incredible is the color accuracy of this thing in SDR the color accuracy of this display is 1.3 that is exceptional you expect less than two for professional color work so that means that if you want to be doing video editing or photo editing or stuff like that on this display you can 100%
trust that the colors that you see are the the actual colors also great is the brightness Razer says this can do 500 nits and we measured it at 526 so full marks there excellent this right here has mhc2 profile tags bit nerdy tangent in the past on a Windows laptop you just have to select a color space and hope for the best whatever your content is gets mapped to that so say that your display like this one right here is able to cover all of DCI P3 so if you have SDR content which does doesn't cover as
many colors it's going to get oversaturated to fit into that dcip P3 color space going back to the mhc2 profile Windows now knows the capabilities of this display so it's able to take what the app wants what the display can do and figure out the most accurate way to put those together this is something that Apple has been doing for a while with their MacBooks but it's very difficult on a Windows ecosystem because so many display is every single display needs its own profile so if
you're making more than like four laptops it's a lot of them that said though this right here is one of the very first ones that comes with that color mapping so you can trust it you can trust it quite a bit also awesome the performance of this thing in here we have a ryzen 98945 HS which is eight course 16 threads and it has the AI right here AI you can see it AI right now we can show off this AI by going in here if you go to manage camera integrated camera right here we have background effects heck
yeah so this right here you're only able to do it within Windows if you have an npu so that's a neural processing unit and it does AI stuff for you if you don't care so much about just blurring the background or having Auto eye contact which I I feel really strange using but anyway it uses AI to do that but also if you're in Photoshop or Lightroom the npu is going to be doing that offloading that processing from your CPU or your GPU that means you have better battery life things run smoother
it's overall just good it's too bad that so many people have just taken Ai and driven it into the ground cuz in stuff like this it's actually pretty nice npu you want it AI in your doorbell maybe not and here we also have 32 GB of 5600 megga transfer per second ram a 1 terb Samsung nvme SSD WiFi 7 from Qualcomm so that is going to be the extra fast Wi-Fi so you can have so many bits traveling over the air at once and also an RTX 4070 and this is a very very fast 4070 up to 140 Watts now
you don't get a whole lot above 90 100 Watts on these but at the same time faster is faster and this one's really really fast also there's AMD radon and integrated Graphics it's a 780m you can use that if you like go on an airplane and want to play a 2d platformer while on battery for a couple hours you play some game you guys want to see some games yeah we're here full screen recording and like rocket league is not a demanding game but at the same time we're easily getting over 200 FPS and
this is working just great the latency of the display it's really really good unsurprisingly a 240 HZ gaming display is very very good for gaming no I scored it oh  12 what else do we want to play cyberp Punk or valheim 22 GB update do valheim it is oh yeah this is running great look be walking along here bam 180Â° bam that display is instant we are only getting 70 FPS but we do have it maxed out this is one of those displays where you can actually like see what you're doing while you're flicking like
flick aside from valheim our Labs did test this cyberpunk 2077 they were able to get 110 FPS F1 2023 166 FPS and total Warhammer was 78 which means this thing goes pretty freaking fast and while we did talk about the keyboard being nice for gaming we haven't talked about it as just a  it's not bad which is pretty much a compliment for Razer it's not perfect so like if we look right here there is a fair bit of key deflection so if I push on the side I can basically get that key
Capa down below the chassis before it actuates almost the larger problem is that it's not super consistent so some of these Keys seem be a little bit stiffer than the others which can make it kind of difficult to get used to it that said if your primary use is gaming it's really good for that the action is super fast so if you want to do like super duper quick like you can do that sort of a thing below the keyboard though is our massive touchpad and this is an area that Razer has just been
absolutely killing it for years and years massive touchpad tracking's accurate it's really really nice just use it's one of the best on the market good job it sounds very clear but I suspect that there's going to be no low end when the drop hits it sounds really nice and wide like they do have that staging from  but it's not bad it's not bad it's not super loud and there's very little in the way of of Base but at the same time it's clear it's not distorting so good job overall up next
is our webcam it's a 1080p webcam so good stuff there and almost more importantly it has a little switch on it so you can just fully disable it absolutely love that turn her back on and it looks pretty decent it's doing quite a good job of exposing for my face let's turn around here and see if it still exposes for my face oh it's struggling pretty hard but in Ness it is pointed directly at a studio light move around here figure it  on there we go it sorted in it it's getting the color temperature a little
bit strange like I'm I'm kind of sickly looking at the moment but if if if if we figure it out if come on come on come on there we go I gave it a shake now it looks good again overall it's quite good but sometimes it does seem to get confused at T5 screws later that are all the same size and we are in an unsurprisingly massive Vapor chamber this thing has been very well cooled getting 140 Watts out of a GPU on a 14-in device is incredibly impressive and the only real way to do that Vapor
chamber and this one is massive all the way around here up along there down the sides we've got our fins right there that exhaust out the back and two great big fans I'm almost surprised that there isn't thir oh my God holy crap Razer you have done it I was really not expecting to see upgradeable memory in here it is something that is just dying out almost completely especially on Compact and Powerful 14-in laptops massive Frost so good guys also upgradeable we've got our
SSD right there and our Wi-Fi card over here which is awesome so the stuff that you expect to be able to replace on a laptop is actually very replaceable and very easy on this one right here now down below we have our 68 wat hour battery which is just excellent It's not the most battery that you can get in this sort of a class but you are kind of trading off the extra GPU horsepower for just the space that this battery is able to take up now Razer claims that you're able to get over 10 hours of battery
life on this thing although that said in our Labs testing our endurance test ran for 6 hours and 55 minutes so 7ish hours is pretty good just not the 10 that Razer said one final thing that I missed before is that this does have Windows hello facial recognition you can see the little IR blasters right there which is just the best way to get into a Windows laptop you just open it up it sees your face and boomy boom you are in well not here cuz I didn't set it up but you get the picture now the tough question
though do you you actually want one of these it is a really great laptop I do really like the Razer Blade 14 but it starts at $2200 for the 4060 version this one that we have been showing off with the 4070 and the 32 GB of RAM is "$2,700 now this is a sponsored video so" we're not going to be making any value judgments here so you can do that for yourself overall though this thing is a fantastically built Windows machine that is great for Content creation and gaming and huge thanks to AMD for sponsoring
this video thanks guys and thank you the viewer for watching this video hit like get subscribed and just have a great all day see you later
