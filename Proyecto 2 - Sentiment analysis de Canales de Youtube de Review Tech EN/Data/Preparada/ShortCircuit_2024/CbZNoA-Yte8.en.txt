what a stealthy laptop oh it's upside down I'm sorry MSI you sponsored this video and I'll be gentle from now on let's put the laptop aside for a second and see what we get in the box of the MSI stealth a16 AI Plus in here we have our power brick which is good for 240 Watts which is delivered over this proprietary charger I'm not a huge fan of that but at the same time that is on the absolute limits of USB type-c and this will be more efficient in here we also have our quick
start guide which tells you connect to power and turn it on in many different languages well I know it's called the stealth but in the top down you just can't even see it it's just a monolith there if I turn it a tiny bit oh there's the MSI logo no gamer stuff here today just pure stealth on this magnesium alloy chassis which is decently light let's see looking at the weight here it comes in at 2.1 kg or 4.6 lb and given the power of this thing that is pretty darn good spoilers it has
a 4070 in it this is definitely the kind of laptop that you can fool your boss into thinking is professional and very nice when an actual fact it's a gaming laptop in disguise but the secret is though a good gaming laptop and a good workstation same thing no one has to know the difference okay let's have a look here the chassis is really quite sturdy I can push if I like really send it right below the space bar you can see a little bit of flex but the Magnesium aloy chassis very stiff as we
expect panels got a tiny bit of movement but nothing out of the ordinary does it okay it doesn't bounce doesn't bounce too bad very good oh is it matte you guys didn't tell me this was a matte display I love it here we also have a healthy amount of IO so we've got headphone microphone combo Jack USB 4 a usba and also our power inputs right there hopping over to the left side we have ethernet 2.5 confirmed it's 2.5 h2i 2.1 and another USB type A nothing on the back nope just heat sink all right let's hit it
here that's really antil climatic with no RGB on the keyboard I think I can enable some oh there we go the first thing that I've noticed while booting this up is that the screen is fanastic in the sense that it's not trying to do more than it needs to so many displays are just completely oversaturated overdone this right here is just Pleasant it's the matte finish we have 600 nits of of peak brightness and also 16x 10600 piece so it's like 1440 but just a little bit taller so that you can fit
more stuff onto your laptop and it's just an aspect ratio that makes way more sense in a laptop form factor H this keyboard might not suck the keyboard I think is fine you will be able to get up to full speed on it and I was able to type without making a whole lot of errors but it is certainly not a satisfying experience the consistency key to key is not super high so it isn't going to allow you to like absolutely shred like on some other laptops but that's said I don't think
it's going to actively hold you back and for gaming in particular it's going to be just fine what's actually good though is the trackpad that's below it they haven't done anything super fancy like you don't get a force touch trackpad but it is just a very simple large trackpad that takes except all of the available space that they have there it has a real nice soft sort of click like it's not very loud but it's nice and responsive it more than does the job all right let's have a look at our specs here for
the CPU we have an AMD ryzen AI 9 365 which has 10 cores 20 threads and goes up to 5 GHz boost we also have 32 GB of RAM at 7500 megat transfers per second a terab of storage from WD Wi-Fi 7 from Qualcomm love to see that we also have our GPU which is an Nvidia RTX 470 the 8 GB version and of course we have an npu this one's good for 50 tops so you can do all of your co-pilot plus things that you want to do have paint generate images and fun things like that what I do actually like is that they have
intelligent switching of your modes of the laptop something like 90% of people from data that I have seen will never change the mode of their laptop so it will be a huge benefit to them to have this changing between an office mode where it's really quiet and cool and has long battery and then automatically switching into a gaming mode for when you actually need that sort of power all of that's just taken care of through  engine ooh the spatial of the audio is pretty good that F1 car sounded like it
went from like here all the way over to there all right how many FPS do you guys think we're going to get I'm say 110 okay so it looks like we're getting about 90 FPS here sometimes it goes up to 100 but I think that makes sense we are screen recording this and labs in their Labs testing were able to get 110 FPS out of this so it all just about lines up and I would say that I am having really quite a good time 240 HZ display even if you're not getting all of those frames looks pretty freaking
good when you're gaming on it oh I just got fastest lap and since I've have asserted my dominance I think that we can call it there thank you to whoever just dropped something one one sec one sec one sec you hear that that is both not very loud and an incredibly good quality to those fans cuz you can have fans that are not particularly loud but if it's a really annoying not particularly loud sound it's it's still annoying this right here was just a nice whoosh you won't really hear it cuz it's
not just quiet but it's nice okay let's see how the speakers are in here we have the D audio system which has two pairs of force cancelling wolfers and two tweeters and I'm guessing it's perfectly fine it seems like spatially it is doing a really good job like this sounds super wide like it's laptop something like this big but at the same time it sounds very tinny we're not getting a whole lot on the low end it's very high but let's see at the drop here okay it's it's all
right that's nothing exceptional though I want to see if there are some controls though let's see if what happens if I just turn audio effects off hm that's uh you want the effects to stay on that is for sure you turn them off and it sounds like it's this big and a tin can yeah leave that on oh man does this have that thing too easy surround a I really like this feature we're not going to show it off right now but you can have a Bluetooth speaker that just like goes behind your
head or pairs to add more speakers to your laptop setup which is actually pretty sick cuz you can very easily have like a janky surround sound setup from just Bluetooth speakers that you have laying around your house and it's pretty awesome all right how is this webcam it's looking not too bad I did hear the microphone earlier and it seemed like it wasn't so good but you can be the judge of that let's move this around it seems to be doing a pretty decent job I'm a little bit blown out here and it's
definitely grainy but at the same time this is some pretty challenging lighting as I move around between shadows and super bright Studio lighting it is making me very red which I don't think I am in person a little bit a little bit not like that though I think that this webcam gets a it's perfectly fine but what makes it very good is that we have Windows hello facial recognition up here and if that doesn't recognize you we also have a fingerprint reader down here and the combo of those two is is my
absolute favorite cuz maybe you're in harsh lighting and your windows hello doesn't work just fingerprint it maybe you have gloves on and you can't use your fingerprint wow your face worked the two together is great just like taking apart laptops is great all right 7 Phillips head screws and a lot of patience and prying later we are in and there is a lot to like in here in particular this 99.99 wat battery you can put a maximum of 100 W hours on a plane so they got in just under that and it's good for 8
hours and 30 minutes according to our Labs which is fantastic for a gaming laptop or not a gaming laptop a professional laptop such as this one that is very powerful as for upgrade ability we have a Wi-Fi card right here that can be swapped out if you want to go to Wi-Fi 10 in the future or whatever it ends up being we also have an empty SSD slot right here which I love to see but unfortunately the ram is soldered down with the speeds that it's going at 7500 megat transfers per second you
cannot currently get sodm that are that fast so I can see the tradeoff of not allowing you to upgrade it but it is still a little bit unfortunate what's not unfortunate though is the cooling system in here we have five heat pipes two fans and as you heard it is pretty good at being silent and of course below those heat pipes is the GPU and if you have been looking at nvidia's market price at all it is good for AI lots of people think it's good for AI it can do things like Photoshop and blender and
just generally be very fast overall I have to say this is quite a solid package heaps of power heaps of well power but in battery form and the price is actually not too bad this thing comes in at "$2,000 at Best Buy and you can check" that out at the link down below and if you don't want to check it out there's also a whole slew of other laptops that Ms I makes Creator Prestige and Summit and also thank you very much for watching this video hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day
I'll see you later
