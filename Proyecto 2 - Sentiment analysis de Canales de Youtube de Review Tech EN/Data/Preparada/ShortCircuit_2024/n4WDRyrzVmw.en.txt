I was in New York City recently and as any good tourist does I visited one of their magnificent Apple Stores and aside from the fire marshal headache inducing amount of people in the store the other thing that surprised me was the weird ass accessories that they happened to sell at the official store like this water bottle that looks like somebody ordered it off AliExpress but that's an Apple store price tag and then when I got home and I was looking up what the heck are these things I found a bunch
more weird ones so let's take a look at some very strange Apple accessories and what better way to do that than with a very strange person who is also into very strange things except not Apple things so he can tell me uh if they're crazy from a non-apple person perspective which one do you want to start with Elisha The Big Box this is the Belin Auto tracking stand Pro with DOT kit support Pro a detection oh that's French yeah it caught my eye because it's expensive but um the basic
function of this as far as I could tell is you record and do break dancing so hopefully you can manage that and I guess it's supposed to track you for the insane amount of money we paid for this I'll get to that later before we get in the Box looking on the outside it's made for iPhone you're not going to be using this with your Android phone they sell it at the Apple Store no duh uh smooth 360 rotation and auto tilt okay so this should be pretty good it also charges the phone which is great and it doesn't
use an app I don't know I'm skeptical on that how that is supposed to work maybe Apple has like native integration but there's the unit the rest of the box we have charging cable uh we've got a USBC power brck also in the Box what is this this is a 5vt 3 amp 15 wat and a manual oh look at that instructions it asks for 6 in of clearance around it I mean how violently does it swing your phone okay step one plug it in it says tap it where on the little oh okay configuring accessory for
first time use this may take a few moments how was your trip New York I don't like New York I'm sorry I'm sorry if you live in New York done all right step three put the phone on vertically oh I can't tell if it's working or not open the camera app which we did oh and then focus on somebody go over there you want me to go over there yeah yeah why not there we go oh oh oh is it working oh my God it is hey guys welcome to my Tik Tok page  I mean it's doing a pretty decent job of
like keeping up with you uh it does go up and down but it's it's pretty slow oh it does go all the way down it even goes down to here our sponsor thanks to manscape for sponsoring this video ring in 2025 with a fresh new look for your nether regions their performance package 5.0 Ultra includes the lawnmower 5.0 Ultra for some under the belt trimming and the weed whacker 2.0 for your ears and nose it even comes with their crop Soother aftershave lotion crop preserver deodorant and two free gifts make sure

my account hello Tik Tok it records it it did the front camera I work with Tik Tok this seems pretty good if it didn't cost this is $180 I would not spend $180 on this this is a scam Apple I expected more next speaking of content creation uh this one also from the Apple Store the shift Cam snapl and led ring light for mag safe this is less stupid I just ring lights are so like come on isn't a ring light supposed to like go around the camera so that way you get like a nice even light
spill when you're looking at the lens well I thought that that's that's how it makes the like little rings on your eyes the whole point is just animate eyes right what is this oh this is for you it's like a pleb magnet oh so if I don't have mag safe yeah so you're going to stick this on your phone you might as well uh just do it okay I'm sure it won't be that hard to get off after well in here was a cable you want to tell us how long it was it's it's a USBC to a 2.0 cable sick
very short oh you actually did it okay well you told me I had to let's see all righty is it the magnet strong all right I'm having a good conversation I don't it's strong enough okay I think if you're like okay doing yeah it's going to freak out but does it have pass through I don't know can you do multiple mag safe things yeah I'm going to try to put it on our our wonderful Balon device here you didn't peel it pill ooh oh look at that mirror so you can look at that instead of the lens that's not what you
should be doing if you're filming hey look you guys can see yourselves you see yourself in there if you're looking at the light and your camera's over here it's just going to look like you're not looking at the content nope can't double it up all right see you later let's try it I guess oh there we go oh God that is terrible oh wait no it gets brighter that's wa okay so it's got like four brightnesses it seems oh yeah oh so it's giving me eye stuff they're not circles
though it's so small that it's just like little pin holes when I'm looking at the light I'm immediately not looking at the camera yeah don't look at the light I really wish you could spin it around but it is pretty bright and it does give you the effect kind of collapse it could you conceivably keep it on your phone oh my God yo yo we're stupid oh we're so stupid this is a great product what am I talking about it can be used with the rear cam we were just dumb how much does it cost 40 bucks yeah $4 us
$40 I would pay 20 maximum this product is what originally caught my eye the hydrate spark Pro Steel it's I guess a smart water bottle it's it's say 24 hours cold so we got to assume it's insulated it's got a flippy sippy uh it's got Bluetooth it's got colors does this not look like I bought this off temu I'm pretty convinced or like you walk into one of one of those stores like a tourist store that sells New York City T-shirts got it yeah and they would have these on a shelf but no
it's from the Apple Store it Sparkles then you drink oh it's like to remind you to like stay hydrated oh yeah works with apple Health all right that is really small there's a water bottle there's a I think this is a straw hey it's a straw all right what is in here there's some stuff in there you might want to take out propaganda charging cable oh there's two types of Lids why I thought it was like there was I thought it was like a convertible lid that did both no this is
two different Lids oh I think this one's for the straw and that one's just like so you can sip from they call this one a chug lid how do you what I don't know that's why I'm asking you oh my goodness you got to really jam it in there but it just connects on the inside you can the little button that open opens the cap on the this sippy drippy opens and closes and it has a lock oh this does not oh boy it's a proprietary cable my favorite that's probably a foot and a half USB a to whatever that is oh
that's so disappointing where's the instructions there is no instructions it's all in what is this this was in the thing yes it just tells you what sensors are like in the water bottle I have no idea what it is is this for compliance what am I looking at okay oh scan this with smartphone oh it took me to their website to buy more it does apparently work with not just iPhone maybe if I open the app oh my God I have to make an account to use my water bottle add bottle okay what type of smart bottle
would you like to connect Bluetooth never put the sensor in the dishw oh my God oh my God brother oh that's so stupid oh oh my God you have to charge it on the inside you have to take it oh you know what I actually don't think this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life it is detachable which means you could dishwash this sure separately and I bet you you could probably buy another one of these but it's to still charge from the outside I think Char the fact that you have to take that off to
charge it is really inconvenient the cable's so short he's like out of frame trying to like plug it dude this cable oh actually no oh it's pretty weak oh yeah it doesn't really sit nicely apparently according to their website can last 10 to 14 days oh and only take 2 and 1/2 hours to charge so I guess if you throw the bottle in the dishwasher charge that by the time it's done dishwashing you probably get like a week out of it reset your bottle sensor turn your bottle upside down and remove it
okay wait do you have to add water press the reset button located on top of the sensor oh right there oh it picked up immediately okay put back put it back in  yeah W red hey what more the red go red and orange strange gold lemon lime okay aqua blue Moonlight purple it's decently well diffused I feel like there's got to be a way that they're monetizing this mother you have to pay money to customize the color $20 a year for 40 plus drink types hydration score glow studio and
wallpapers in the app oh my God it's $3 a month or $20 a year if this was $100 a year I would be losing it this is not that expensive but I do hate subscriptions to be fair $20 a year is cheaper than an LT store water bottle so you would save M well how much is this water bottle we haven't found that out yet do you want to know I need water first okay I will go get water how much does this bottle cost I'm going to find out right now oh my God what it's $60 on sale it's usually $70
update sensor firmware begin oh oh my God is this going to take 35 minutes I'm  minutes oh we're good is the fir more update done allow hydrate to use your location we'll keep track of where you last held your bottle with you to help you avoid losing it we'll use the local weather to adjust your hydration goal please recalibrate empty your bottle transfer it to the good water bottle oh my goodness this hasn't been cleaned in a while ew okay well I'll drink from fine that's anable problem
wait 10 seconds why do I have to wait 10 seconds it's calibrating for best results after drinking set the bottle on a flat surface for a few seconds so the sensor can measure the water level goal 33.8 O Okay do a drink let's see if it like just does immediately better drink that gross water keep going keep going keep going keep going keep stop stop stop now put it down hey updated damn it I only drink 5 oz I need more when is it supposed to Glow well glow regardless of your Daily
Progress when I take a drink when I meet my goal okay now try another drink and now it should in theory glow oh man I'm so thirsty again it's good what were we going to do if you weren't thirsty might be screwed good job I drank my water it didn't glow I love how we just wait for it is it is it maybe not glowing because the battery's low is it broken did we break it I just had water bro I your hourly goal is surpassed so you're good let's go by a lot your hourly goal is 2 oz and you did
21 oh that means I'm good for the next 10 right I don't have to drink you're so hydrated right now yeah how much was this again $70 us I mean in line with a insulated water bottle with a puck in it this is not shockingly priced yes that's fair it does measure technically the weight I guess there must be a weight sensor in here I don't see how else this would do this so it does it based off weight it does seem to track the things the glow is not working anymore and there's a stupid
subscription if you want to customize the glow beyond that I think it's pretty gimmicky but if you wanted something to help you stay hydrated by tracking how much water you drink and reminding you I don't think this is like egregious like it's horrible I could see this actually helping people now let's move on to something I didn't find in the Apple store but is for an iPhone and is something I upon while looking up the things that I bought after the fact this is the g- clicks Creator keyboard I've
seen this thing before this reminds me of the meme from like years ago it was like the iPhone 20 is going to be this long oh it's so long all right I scanned the QR code it's taking us to clicks. te you have to download an app I'm not surprised oh come on actually a pretty nice setup guide better than the water bot bottle cuz it actually tells you what to do when inserting SL removing the iPhone from the keyboard keep your phone straight dud it just clicks I get it it looks so funny in your hand it
looks like it's it feels funny in my hand it looks topheavy it is topheavy it's telling you how to use a keyboard press one two three okay it's a toggle I mean that's that makes sense that's like on iPhone right what press what key is that oh you're right that does not look like a key on your keyboard that's not a key that's not on your keyboard it looks like three little dots and on is this one oh it's this one yeah wow that's so it's just wrong what an absolute fumble and why are you
like who cares just let me do any Emoji why do I have to put a specific one look it literally fails if you don't put the correct heart emoji this is actually psychotic I don't understand why are these things grayed out yeah they're grayed out oh tab control oh there's a backlight oh okay okay I've made an account now please God nope still locked out let's try typing hey guys this is this I hate this this is terrible it sounds terrible it feels terrible it feels really bad like the
buttons are too far off of the case so that it's it's kind of hard to click they're Blackberry feeling see I was actually going to bring that point up one thing my dad really really hates is he doesn't want to get a new phone because he loves his BlackBerry physical keyboard yeah but he's just wrong oh this is horrible dude um but the thing about the Blackberry keyboards is they're laid out like an actual keyboard where there's Square buttons so there's more surface area on each key
mhm this one because they're broken up like that it's not fun to type on I also just noticed like the keys are like vertical oh they're not offset they're not offset like a normal keyboard like where where can oh yeah you're right so if you're looking at a normal phone keyboard versus this one you can see the keys kind of have like a a grid pattern almost in the top one where they kind of like are offset but then the keyboard on the clicks is vertical and linear and I
actually think that's why I'm struggling to type so much it very much seems like they went for cool Instagram markety appeal making it look cute and not making it a functional device can you charge it oh it's got a it does have a lightning port and how does it feel with the side buttons fine just a silicon pass through I think it's kind of yeah it is yeah the only thing I can imagine this as is like a Christmas white elephant gift how much does this cost so depending on the phone you have it could
be between 140 us or $160 oh my God last thing last thing I know I'm going to love this one okay this what is this the tiny pod live different I like that it's got like the OG Apple branding oh yeah it's upside down it's upside down yeah it's a case oh I see where this is going this patent pending device is a case for your Apple watch but a very specific case and we ended up with the wrong one I guess it's supposed to make your Apple watch look like a classic iPod you can get ones
with a functional touch wheel which is pretty cool so we got the like three different sizes here so this one is probably for the Apple watch Ultra this looks like for the larger case Apple watch and that's for the smaller case this looks like just a spa story you're going to have to put it up your butt El I'm sorry this looks horrible I don't know what function this is supposed to serve other than just being a meme but like it's even kind of hard to use the crown you lose all
functionality of having an Apple Watch if you wanted to check your vitals you can just it's not like it's adding a headphone jack that you can now connect oh see if it did that I think that'd be kind of cool this is a meme right okay the other one is cool this is stupid even this one is $30 I mean okay it's like a little case that's fine I guess the actual one looks kind of cool yeah we just they when we reached out to them they just didn't send it yeah they actually sent the wrong one this just
seems like they they did the cad already and already had the like models so they were like yeah okay we can just make one that's cheap and doesn't do literally anything maybe if there's like a cool Apple Watch app that like made made it into a light switch or something and this like just attached on the wall and that was your light switch be the most expensive light switch smart home okay overall we got all of our things here in terms of the ones actually from the Apple Store our Belin Auto tracking
gimbal thing the water bottle and the light the light is fine the water bottle is fine this thing kind of sucks for the money it works but it's too slow that's true even when we were backing up trying not to move that fast it's too slow I don't know Apple I feel like you got to up your game and that is I I want to try the real I want the other one cuz this this is just pointless it's pointless so pointless it's useless so let us know what you guys thought about the accessories here hopefully you had fun
going on this adventure with us um Has anyone used the actual tiny pod cuz it looks kind of dope yeah let us know I'm sad about it
