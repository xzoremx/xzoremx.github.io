a year ago we took a look at the prusa markv today we're looking at the prusa Mark 4S which is a big upgrade and for the same price or if you already have a markv only a $100 upgrade kit so we're going to take a closer look at some of the upgrades that theyve put into it we gummy bears as always we use the crues around the office quite a bit they're one of the workhorses we have around here and I'm looking forward to adding these ones to our Arsenal and upgrading the  this as always another USB stick
anything else hiding yes many things hiding more boxes in this box we have the accessory kit which has a bunch of tools a filament guide spool holder and some lube and a couple of other odds and ends and a spool of filament Galaxy black always pretty most of the parts of this are similar to The markv but there are two big improvements one is the part cooling shroud and fan system which is going to allow for faster Printing and way better overhangs and something we can't see right now is a new hot end to
allow for way higher flow rates some of the other quality of life upgrades are the screen cover which is now injection molded and some of the more mechanically robust parts are printed out of a polycarbonate carbon fiber infused filament the unit we got was fully assembled so just take it out of the box put it down plug it in and go they say it would take you about 10 minutes to get from out of box to your first print let's flick it on one of the other things they've released is a mobile app
and an update to their desktop app this allows you to browse through your printers start and stop prints and you can set up print notifications for either failures or successes and other General printer status information setup pretty straightforward you just tap the NFC with your app going and scan a QR code to get it set up as with all PR printers you don't need to have it set up to the Wi-Fi and you can print completely offline if you want to let's finish up the self tests
and calibrations it's going to go through and just make sure that all the systems are behaving the way it expects to make sure that it arrived in fully functioning order hi  one of the things I appreciate with the prusa systems is they go through the self testing calibration right at the start and then after that you pretty much never have to recalibrate them unlike some of the other systems which run it before every single print which can take a lot of extra time when you're
running a lot of prints it's all the main axis done and heat testing this might take a minute that's probably a good time to cut cut cut cut since we didn't build this printer ourselves we don't have to deal with the gearbox test but from what I've seen it's pretty straightforward all right now we're going to take out the filament and make sure the filament sensor is working correctly insert filament make sure doing more calibrating and remove sweet happy printing now that the
printer is all set up and ready to go let's give you a word from our sponsor delete me protecting yours and your family's online privacy is a team effort and with delete me's new family plans everyone in your household is covered each family member receives personalized data cleanup services to keep their private information secure and from kids to adults they ensure everyone is protected from online threats and scams so don't wait give your family the peace of mind they need by heading to the link
in the video description to learn more while this is heating up one of the other changes they made was to put some more bearing style engineering materials on the inside of the gearbox housing just to give smoother running in the long term generally speaking prusa doesn't push printed as fast as you possibly can but one of the things they did include on this is an 8-minute Beni   fast and it looks really good especially given how quickly it printed obviously not a regulation Beni it's a little
Hollow but still for how quickly that printed this looks spectacular one of the big things that they claiming is to be able to handle 75Â° overhangs without any support cleanly I've done a couple of test prints on some of the other printers we have in house we'll start a print here and see how it turns out overall I'm really excited for the upgrades that this brings and I'm probably going to reach out to them today to get a bunch of kits to upgrade all of our printers internally cu the
speed Improvement and the quality improvement looks substantial and all of these upgrades coming at the same price point as the original printer at $800 "for the build your own kit and ,100 for" the pre-built it's pretty compelling if you want to see us talk about other printers in the future make sure to like And subscribe bye-bye bye
