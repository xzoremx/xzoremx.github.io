OLED 2K resolution Ultra wide and curved these are all specs that are better than my personal gaming mod and probably yours too so of course today we're talking about an AIO wait what yes this right here is the trikes Panorama 360 argb and it has a curved AMOLED display on it that apparently looks freaking incredible why you would want that we don't know I genuinely have no idea but let's have a look at it it looks like an Nvidia box for their RTX cards very nice oh also six-year warranty I do like that
quite a bit getting in here though of course the first thing that you see is the display rate here unfolding imagination ooh they're even proud of their box design okay besides the contrast and color of this being a bit hard on the eyes this does look like a really wellth thought out little user manual here aios are one of the only things where I would strongly recommend reading the instructions because you can get really screwed up if you do something like missing a washer in a spot that it's
supposed to be or trying to put in the wrong screws into your motherboard it can cause loads of issues and maybe you'll find out halfway through that you need to undo everything that you just did and redo it all again cuz you screwed up in a little tiny way this looks pretty easy though we have platform support for Intel 1150x up to 1700 but not for HDT plat platforms and also of course am4 and am5 let's put this guy over to the side for a second and just have a little look at what we
have here there's all of our stuff in nice little bags it looks like we have a little controller what is this for RGB yep very simple just RGB it does look like we have a motherboard sync which I like to see which means that you can have your fans go RGB without using their software although I imagine you very much need their software to use the screen we have some Alpha 01 thermal grease I have no clue if this is good stuff but we will find out soon enough and of course all of our mounting
supplies right here B should we start installing it yeah no we should segue to our sponsor thanks to ug green for sponsoring today's video they're bringing you some fast and fun charging accessories for the new iPhone first up is the ugreen Uno charger 100 W robot and its funky design that doubles as a fun desk buddy the cute emojis on the TFT screen even change as your device charges it delivers 100 Wat fast charging through its C1 or C2 Port meaning your MacBook Pro and other Apple
devices will be Juiced up in no time and that's not all you can charge up to four devices at once with three USBC ports and a usba a port they also have the ch2 certified Uno 15 W wireless charger tailor made for Apple users check them out using the link in the description now to verify that our trikes cooler is actually pretty decent we have set up a very simple test we have a shortcircuit computer here which has a 360 aiio as as well this one is from Cooler Master and we have just run cin bench as well as
screen recorded for 30 minutes logged the data and we will just be testing it out right here so here is our Baseline how easy do you think this cooler is going to be to get out of this Bell looking at it this is like kind of a small case the ease of this job has clearly  all doing a speed uninstall my apologies to main gear this right here is an Absolut beautifully cable managed system  it I really appreciate that they taped all these little RGB connections these things are horrible for just coming
apart like look at how easy that was and so taping them or hot gluing them makes this a way more reliable system good job guys okay it took a lot of doing cuz there was a lot of cable management but I think yep we are free there we go we've got this Cooler Master 360 aiio that is now out and we can install our silly one let's just verify that this fits Ray quick this cooler is pretty standard sized but it is ever so slightly larger than normal most radiators are 27 28 mm thick this one
right here comes in at 30 so you get a tiny bit more performance and it does still fit in a normal radiator position which is great cuz we did not pre-check with the tries Panorama you have have two options of fans Not RGB or RGB which is about an extra $10 although I think you might want to consider not getting those fans the problem is that the standard fans have a static pressure of 3.66 mm of water which is pretty standard that is what you expect whereas these RGB ones have 1.8 mm of water
which is pretty terrible when you're are trying to push a whole bunch of static pressure through a radiator it's probably going to be fine but that said this is an extremely premium cooler and I really wish that they had just put some better fans on there cuz that is going to hold back performance if you want to just go all out main gear were nice enough to include a cutout at the back of this case so this will be super easy we're just going to put the little backing plate in there and then we can
screw in our little standoffs to mount the cooler I need to pull off the screen just like so under which we have a nice little fan this right here is presumably to cool down our vrms like to see that and also underneath it we have a pump that is made by acch which means it's actually going to be quite a high quality unit just looking at this screen it is quite large and we can have a little look at the driver circuits right in there very fun one thing that is nice about these fans is that the RGB and the
fan power are combined so you can just daisy chain them together you don't have a whole bunch of wires coming out of it one thing that's not so nice is that it goes into this single proprietary cable which means that if you lose this you are screwed on the bottom of our cold plate there is pre-applied thermal paste which is very nice that other tube was just if you want to apply again but one thing that I've realized that's a little bit unfortunate is that your tubes need
to be at the bottom of the aiio if you look at it this right here goes on such that it is like that and you definitely want to have this great big bit you know showing the front and the side of the screen at all times instead of it being like that like I want the tubes to go up and around but I do not want a screen to just be facing the GPU so instead we're going to have to do it kind of weird like they're going to have to come across here out in front it's very clear that they only thought to have this up
in the top because it's going to be pretty strange looking now that we have a radiator in the front man I really wish I could put them somewhere else can you go around maybe it's salvageable we shall see can I get this guy on with the tubes over there H go on get on there I don't think that's going to happen go over there does it just slide on now yep sure does I can't do anything with those well it is what it is all right I think we are all good time to turn it on and see if it has all
worked RGB on the fans working perfectly those are all good I hear it pumping so that oh there we go look at that what a silly thing Android system update there we go tubes are out of the way the system is up to date when it was updating we briefly saw that this is running Android for some reason so I guess that you could get hacked through the display on your AIO but that's not something that I'm personally going to be too concerned about because it looks pretty freaking cool in there let's have
a little play what can we put on here migration what is this oh very cool you know what at full brightness this thing actually looks pretty darn good let's do a peel here oh yeah that was satisfying now they do say that it can do a 3d effect where it is actually using that this corner is physically closer to you than the edges and it kind of expands stuff around here I don't know how convincing that is but it is a thing that they say another thing this is a 60 HZ display so it's
actually really nice and smooth a lot of little aiio screens that I've seen before will have lower fresh rates and they just cannot deliver what this has that that is a good little display spend some time playing around with the stuff so you can have your system info displayed right here so we have our CPU temp frequency and the date and time and also as you can see you can upload custom images like this beauty rate here you also can split it so we can have two of him on here let's see how this
goes ha perfect what a beautiful thing I am so glad that technology has brought us this oh I can have a whole bunch of   so yeah this is um a thing that you can do one thing that programs like this can be awful for is just using up a whole bunch of your CPU resources even though they're just doing something stupid like putting Linus's face on a screen for the most part it's been doing pretty good but now that I'm doing file processing of a video it's using up a fair bit of
the CPU so hopefully running videos on this will not be too taxing Dam damn all right I put our gr Corolla video on it and I guess that you can just run that and one thing that is fortunate is that it's only using like 1% CPU usage while we are playing an actual video on it which is not too bad I have seen much worse from RGB software before all right I think we are good to find out if this thing is any good I do have to say I really like the display bit of it but of course if your CPU runs hot then who who
cares I do have it set up so that it's connected to the same ports on the motherboard as the other cooler was so it should be a pretty good Apples to Apples test so far so good we're looking at 75° C on the CPU and we are also looking at me showing off a Toyota Corolla gr so wow what other cooler can do that all right all right the screen cooler is doing a pretty darn good job if we look at it here in the red is the previous Cooler Master cooler and in the green we have our trikes OLED cooler if we look
at this here for the most part it seems like that this is around like 73 75° whereas The Cooler Master was sitting much more around like 76 to 80° you can very easily tell there's like a 3 to 5° difference all the way through here and also the powers are just a couple of Watts more going just above 200 instead of just below it so it is very marginal in an improvement but it's also not terrible and when you're going for a cooler that has a great big screen on it not being terrible is kind of all
that you need what you also need is a whole lot of money now on other sites I have seen a quoted that this is around $370 or so but the lowest that we have found was on AliExpress for 515 so uh with any luck you'll be able to find it more in that 300 and a bit dollar range because you'll probably be giving up a bit of performance compared to something like a top tier Asus one but at the same time look at that freaking display but for $500 o you have to really really want
that display just like how I really want you to hit like get subscribed and just have a great old day I'll see you guys later
