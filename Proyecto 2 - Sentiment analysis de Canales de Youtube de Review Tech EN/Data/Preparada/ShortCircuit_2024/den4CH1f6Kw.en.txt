being an early adopter kind of sucks you end up paying a lot more money than people who are more sensible and patient while for those who dare to wait Asus sponsored this video so we can take a look at the XG 27 AQ DMG their new 26.5 in 144p 240 HZ OLED gaming Monitor and it's the world's first glossy woled panel let's get this sucker out of the box I like how it's actually got a little handle here so you can pull it out with all the foam oh okay maybe not  on there we go might take a bit of
strength we want to flip this over keep it all together yeah see all the accessories came out I pulled it out the wrong way what a dummy uh but looks like we got our stand column portion and then we've got our stand bottom portion we have a mount for if we want to do any Vasa mounting it looks like it's got a nice you know simple column design where you throw it in and then you screw it down overall not bad not a big footprint I don't exactly know what this is for but it looks like it might fit my phone
it just barely fits if you've got a case be a little careful but it should fit just barely otherwise we've got Nvidia g-sync badge here it is gsync compatible and it's got AMD free sync and then we've also got a big Republic of Gamers badge that's a little much in terms of branding for me um but it's not the worst we've also got a big Rog on the back of the stand here we've also got got what looks like a/ qu in thread up top so that you can actually screw in a camera or whatever you want on top of
here really handy for those of you you want to use a nicer camera mount when you're trying to stream or something like that we got a barrel Jack going to a reasonably sized power brick it's actually pretty tiny 120 wat and then we've also got our bag of tricks that Asus likes to include I love this little carrying case that'll fit all of your cables what do we got in here microfiber cloth we've got an HDMI cable and then USB 3 USB B to a for those of you wondering what else we got we got some
warranty manual stuff stickers if you like stickers like me and then this looks like the rest of our power cable it certainly is we're going to have to get a different one because this is a European plug and we are in Canada so ah what's this they did happen to include a North America version thank you Asus but now what we really care about our panel it's got some nice foam packaging where's our I/O down here so that means it goes on this way so we're going to do the old click
clack and pull it out you ready for this guys I promise yours won't look like this we got ours tested by the lab and it's kind of hard to put these back on nicely so just you know don't worry about it we've got that nice column swivel on the stand pretty good amount of rotation and then we've got some height adjustment we got some tilt it can pivot we've also got some cable management routing right here and then as for I/O we've got our power plug here headphone jack couple of HDMI ports only
2.0 display port 1.4 with DSC usbb couple of usba a ports and last but not least your favorite a Kensington lock we've also got our nice navigation nipple or nubbin I'm going to start calling it a nubbin cuz I feel weird saying nipple uh and then it's got you know left button right button which is handily labeled power key 1 key2 I actually really like the design on the back of the monitor here um they've done this kind of like slash design before uh this has got a new custom heat sink nice
and thin take care of your OLED panel we'll talk about some OLED care stuff later on once we actually get it fired up we can look through the OSD so what are we waiting for let's turn it on all right looks pretty good looks pretty clean we've got a check out our OSD here display widget Center is actually pretty cool you get like some nice you know in computer um information to change any of the monitor settings uniform brightness is a feature they've got for oleds basically it'll turn your
brightness down a little bit but it makes sure that you don't get that weird uh adaptive brightness stuff that you know you see when you've got a big white screen all of a sudden comes up and then the brightness dims um so it should help with that I don't know if it'll fully fix it but it'll help I'm going to turn it off clear pixel Edge is nice it's funny how when CTI OLED came out everyone talks about text fringing regular OLED has it too and it's always been a problem and clear pixel Edge
should help that a little bit by uh dealing with the green and red fringing that you might encounter so we're going to turn that on uh what else we got display color space srgb DC3 wide gamut color temp this is actually very customizable it's really nice being able to set color temp you can do that on a lot of monitors but not all of them um same with your color space you can't always set this manually yourself oh there's AA RGB where is the oh it's on the back rainbow it's rainbowing just
the Asus logo screen protection so you've got a screen saver that'll turn on automatically if you're inactive for a couple minutes you can turn that on or off pixel cleaning you can manually run a pixel cleaner that only takes about actually 6 minutes it's pretty quick not going to run it right now but you could we've also got screen move this is called pixel shift on a couple other monitors basically what it'll do is it'll adjust all the pixels slightly uh you can notice it I'm not going to say
you can't it's very minor though and I don't know it like happens and then it's over so it's I don't know I I really don't think it's a big deal but it's nice to have and then the logo brightness so if logos are on screen it can adjust the brightness on those uh the reality is OLED these days is solid with the new panel improvements and all of this protection that you have in stuff like OLED care from Asus it just makes it so you don't have to worry about it so much and if you're really
that worried about it check out some other channels coverage cuz they'll let you know that it's not that bad so if you are worried about OLED flicker Asus has a fix for it during refresh rate fluctuations with three refresh rate ranges strong middle or off let's game why am I am I talking to you still I want a game God this looks good oh and you know what I'm telling you 240 htz 1440p on an OLED that's getting like I think we measured 0.1 or 0.3 milliseconds response times latency
wasn't too bad either like I think theoretical perfect was only a half a millisecond off or something like that it's just so good it's something about this being crystal clear that like you flick and then the screen is cleared up like I don't know once you try it it's hard because you guys are probably watching this on an IPS monitor or VA or something and so you can't see how good the HDR looks how good the colors look how good the response times look but the reality is it's just it's so good and if
those response times aren't good enough for you you can enable elmb or extreme low motion blur and that's basically BFI and so you're going to probably get some reduction in brightness but because of the black frame insertion it's even more perfect I'll be honest I don't think that elmb should be a huge selling feature for oleds I don't think it really needs it but if you really need it it's got it so we know it games good but does it HDR footage good oh it's so bright the funny thing is every time we
show this footage the hand is going to like reach in at some point and everyone's like oh my God I thought that hand was actually there because it looks so good good it's really color accurate and when you have OLED pixels powering a display like this they're just going to turn on and off as you need them so oh you want a dark spot boom it's perfect black oh you need this like pin prick of brightness boom we're going to do that we boost a pixel or two or 12 you know or 50 it looks good to my eyes but how
good is it really well we sent it to the lab to get checked out to make sure that we don't unbox something that's just awful and here's the results an SDR set to racing we measured an average Delta e of just 1.81 with a Max of 3.63 that's pretty good but what about HDR gaming HDR mode was surprisingly the most color accurate and with our brightness turned down a touch we measured a Delta e ITP of 24.87 average with a Max of 39.82 turn the brightness to 100% and it gets slightly worse so
pick your poison now onto our two kind of minor but real complaints they advertise a 1300 nits Peak brightness but the best we could get with tweaking was more like 1250 realistically when we just measured out of the box it was only "1,200 so take that as you will it's" "still really bright 1,200 nits is great" and then our other complaint was that they advertised 99% dcip 3 but the most we can measure was 97.6 still pretty close but no cigar but what about the price well that's where I
don't mind these tiny complaints of it because this monitor is $750 normally and it's on sale on Amazon right now for $559 that's really good I just want to say that OLED prices are finally coming down like I get it that's still expensive for a lot of people but even just a few years ago IPS gaming monitors with high refresh rates were also super expensive and now we've got an OLED with these specs at like 700 bucks that's wild give it another year or two and it's probably we're probably going to
get into that like $500 range I can't wait because I love these things and I like being an early adopter look where I work I kind of have to be if I want to actually have any sort of relevancy when I'm talking about these monitors but it comes with a price and you know a lot of you either don't want to pay that or simply can't afford it and there's nothing wrong with that because look what happens you know you wait like 2 3 years and all of a sudden they just come down and they're going to
keep coming down and you know what's really wild this thing went for as low as $550 on Black Friday we're filming it on the Wednesday after what do you guys think are you ready to Shell out this kind of money for an OLED or you just going to rock the same monitor for another couple of years let us know in the comments below thanks so much Asus for sponsoring this video thank you guys for watching let us know what you think in the comments and I'll see you in the next one
