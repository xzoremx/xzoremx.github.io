they asked me to come up with something for short circuit that would be like a Christmas present for you for me I'll show you what I came up with okay I thought us working together on an unboxing of this would be a lot of fun what are you serious it's it's a fiber optic I actually get this light up LED halter bra did you did you actually spend money on this why don't we start unboxing things did you wrap this no okay I mean I can wap I can wap they wouldn't let let me do the halter bra
thing they thought it was too not safe for work oh thank you guys that would have been brutal okay instant camera and photo printer wait don't we have one we are doing a Roundup of instant cameras okay so we're going to play around with them try them out okay see what's good and what's not so good this one looks cool it's shaped like a little battery yeah and Kodak still exists who knew okay it's a shaped like a little battery it's a lot bigger than a little battery what is it shaped
like a battery hold on don't get caught up on the color scheme now you're getting caught up on the color scheme you have to see the color scheme in order to understand why I said that no I'm telling you you don't need to see the color scheme to know what it's shaped like what's it shaped like come on a lens you're making me feel old what it's a film canister oh remember they have the opening in the side where the film comes out and you put it in the thing and pull the thing into it okay
you're my age film canisters were green and black oh good it doesn't print immediately that's nice because the one that we have the minute you take a picture it just prints everything style in Stacks this reminds me of my first digital camera how laggy that display is here hold on let's have an actual thing there so you could I mean it's a cute form factor though I want to take a photo with you okay okay do you like my photo I love your photo let's print it okay hey here
we go it prints stickers yeah oh that's super cute oh reminds me of those photo booths do you remember do I remember photo booths those are still a thing no no no where like where you'd go into the Asian mall and then there would be all these cutesy little stickers that you could print okay let's take a picture okay how's it look wow I took that at completely the wrong angle so can you get color is it yeah no you cannot get color it's only black and white wait why does it show a color
image here then why wouldn't it show black and white so that you does it also have an SD card so you can like get the pictures off it this is kind of uh that's kind of cute I was going to say you can make it a printer though if you connect Bluetooth to it you can print out any picture you print in black and white though yeah okay no seriously why can't you connect this to a a color printer and have it print color but that's not a Vibe this is a Vibe okay actually I'm curious about the sticker
quality and I'm curious how much the sticker refills cost it doesn't seem that sticky here replace this stupid picture no what why it's awful cuz this is what youngu looks like and now you can have a side by side comparison I have two things I want to say about the price first I'm going to say if it's any more than 50 bucks then you're getting ripped off and second I'm going to say that it costs 120 bucks I was going to guess 100 USD $39.99 USD oh really nine roll is about $19.99 okay at least it's
cheap at 7 cents a pop this is something I'd actually be able to use without feeling like oh no is it worth is it worth taking a picture of this also we're both idiots we're using this shutter button there's one here yeah I love it okay what's next the second one is from uh today's video sponsor debrand oh no oh it's wrapped also in a dbrand skin and of course they're promoting their own crap instead of our collaborative short circuit or glow circuit skin I still can't believe you
guys didn't go with the white on white it looks so good oh yeah yvon has a type of the circuit skin that I don't think you can see it dbrand never made yeah so Ivon just like hacked together a skin for her phone from the white on white glow but it looks so good let dbrand  okay okay we got this oh wow that was a lot of packaging just to get an Instax camera okay wait this is really creepy do do you oh these are pictures from our house yeah who walked in did dbrand oh it must have
been Sammy what is that why you were at our yeah that's why he was at our house just taking pictures of the inside of our basement fridge this is my uh this is my soda methadone by the way I actually hate bubbly it sucks but it's a lot better than getting fat so I drink bubbly whenever I crave a soda if you guys want to check out dbrand skins which as you can see are very difficult to get off of things but to their credit do come off cleanly when it is time to swap them out for something new like oh
I don't know say glow circuit you can check out dbrand skins atl.com we have one of these that's what I was going to say or a very similar to this one at home it's fine I guess um yeah so you do that and that opens it up and then you can take a picture like that the mirror kind of sucks yeah it's tiny oh I wasn't ready okay I mean does it matter at least this one prints in color right yes yeah okay but the cartridges are flipping expensive yeah oh my gosh yeah not the most flattering photo
I will say that the fun of waiting for it to develop and looking at it together is a huge advantage to this particular format but the fact that it's like 10 shots in a package and these packages are like aren't these like 20 bucks or something like that sorry 12 bucks either way we gifted our daughters one of these like a few years ago a few years ago and they've only gone through a few packs of them cuz on like kid allowances buying refills just doesn't make any sense that is insanely
expensive this in color is my sweet spot cuz this cost what cents a shot oh yeah 7 cents a shot and this was a dollar something a11 12 yeah so I want this to cost three times as much in be in color but let's see what else we get today okay ooh LT corkboard yeah it's for people who collect like our pins and stuff or just want a corkboard that's expensive oh I didn't know we had this yeah that's cool Boop okay all right what are we looking at oh actual Polaroid brand I was going
to say the exact same thing oh I'm sorry go ahead you do it actual Polaroid brand wow good job oh and it's even in the Polaroid like form factor but tiny oh it's cute okay so you got to power it on it's got a digital display for how many shots are left that's kind of nice compared to the Instax which works more like a uh like a disposable camera oh that's cool the mirror for selfies is actually just two-way glass for the lens for taking pictures okay I'm going to  ready that's awkward I don't know if
that worked I can't it says it's down to five does it take a while to come out um do we have more film uh no that one is like a proprietary one I blame Sammy he broke it before he gave it to us it's out it's done it's empty Sammy you took all the pictures before you even gave it to us I took one two I took two photos okay well either way I'm going to guess that this is like 150 bucks and the cartridges are like 20 bucks uh it's 6832 USD uh 16 shots is apparently $28 so price per
photo is 175 okay wa okay yeah so I think it is normally a cartridge of eight yeah okay okay so it's probably 14 bucks a cartridge and it's cartridges of eight then cuz the counter says eight yeah when you load when you reload it yeah I don't know what to tell you if sami's pictures or anything to go by quality wise not to mention the fact that it uses a proprietary form factor when you can get like knockoff Instax film for cheaper this is pretty hard to justify even if the camera is a little
cheaper and I think the photos are even smaller than the STS right yeah they're smaller which sucks this really seems like a fail yeah see you later buddy maybe the problem is the way you're opening them maybe I should open it what no it is not maybe it was from you like twisting and turning it while it was printing another Polaroid the now plus instant camera generation 2 this looks really expensive wow it's really big well yeah it's just like an old school Polaroid camera and then what's this so
you can carry around your oh your filters red filter sure yellow filter other more different more yellow filter that's orange well look do I do colors for a living what is that let's do that fun filter okay just checking wait it's not on properly sorry sorry says seven shots uh how can you see the mirror or camera on this one's  good dude this one's going to be super expensive 120 I am going to say 135 and then I'm going to say that the pictures are going to be like 15 bucks
for a pack of eight I think they're going to be really expensive um I'm going to go with a160 per photo uh so Ivon was spot on for the price is $119.99 she said $150 no I changed it to 120 you did yeah oh dang it well then I ended up guessing the same thing as you uh did I say 120 no you said 135 yeah you said 13 Oh I thought I was guessing under her oh well 16 shots is apparently "uh $35 so it's about ,750 per a pack of" eight um okay so it's over $2 a photo and you can't even see the photo before
you print it and the selfie cam or mirror was terrible like you you can't really see that that's really expensive to just like trial and error get something I mean that's why even though Polaroids existed when we were a kids nobody used them cuz they were stupid yeah and they're just as stupid now but they're like retro stupid trendy stupid I don't know the only time that I feel like these are worth doing are at places like a wedding or at graduation or whatever where it's just like it's it's
not necessarily about capturing the moment it's more about just doing something together right cuz if you want to capture the moment you're better off with like a proper camera or a professional who's going around like getting good pictures oh this looks more modern ooh Leica the Leica swort of so forth hybrid instant camera 10 lens filters plus 10 film filters what's a film filter you can use it as a printer you can print from your phone you can take shots and save them to your phone
so this like actually has functionality which is nice yes oh yeah oh wow this thing is a fingerprint magnet cool got a nice little lens cover here got your flash got your pH oh that's bright oh interesting the interface defaults to like a vertical orientation but then everything is kind of Orient I'm just going to take this off look I'm not trying to there's another shutter button somewhere I think okay there's one here there's one here here how how laggy is this one oh way better
yeah that's like modern I feel good about this one I feel really good about oh what's this is this to that's the print oh cute okay so that would normally be a film advance but they've just gone and taken that mechan Mech ISM and made it that okay all right you ready okay did we take a picture oh wow the camera quality is too good we look old dude oh that's so cute that's so cute it pushes your picture out and everything uses insta film yep you want to guess the price um like it it's not going to be cheap
okay how much is a normal digital camera like not a hybrid maybe like 100 to 150 USD oh yeah yeah I guess the hybrid functionality so like just having just a cute little like a digital camera that you can actually offload pictures from is there an SD card y micro SD okay there it is okay I'm going to go with 145 USD I'm going to say 200 I think it's going to be pricey 400 W 400 bucks seriously that's my guess oh okay well  $400 uh yeah I don't think that I would be buying that for
$400 I mean the quality is a lot better like it should be the same as the inst Stacks actually no it's probably got better Optics than the cheap in Stacks look at that and this one isn't even properly developed yet you can see your crows feet hey that turned out pretty well I wouldn't pay $400 for it but the Optics are definitely better it's got lots of fun filters and I guess it's the winner in terms of image quality because I didn't get to try the one I really wanted anyway you might have noticed
Ivon is gone that's because one of our kids got a nose bed that wouldn't stop so she had to leave but if you want to see more of her it's Ivon week on float plane our themed weeks basically take one person from the team or one theme and we do a bunch of exclusives over at lm. floatplane yvon's content includes a community Q&amp;A video decorating a Christmas tree with old Tech and meet the cats where you get to meet all of our cats you can watch it and our catalog of exclusives by going to lmg Dogg SL
