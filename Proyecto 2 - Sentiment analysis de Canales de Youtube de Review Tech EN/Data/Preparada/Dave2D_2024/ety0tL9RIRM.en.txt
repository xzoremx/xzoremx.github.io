so this airpod looking thing showed up at the studio and this was sent by a company who in the past have sent me very accurate and reliable mockups of Hardware that's pre-release so they sent me blanks of upcoming iPhones they've sent me the resin model of the pixel fold before it was available they also sent me the Surface Duo like a functioning surface Duo before it was released they have a very good track record with me but last week when this device showed up I thought it was pretty
interesting because this is supposed to be a upcoming airpod Pro case and it's just airpods Pro except the defining feature is that it has a touchcreen on it now when I cut this in when I pulled it out of the box the first reaction I had was like there's no way this is real there's no way that apple is coming out with this thing because there's so many questions so many thoughts I have about this thing about why it probably shouldn't even exist but I I asked them is this legit and they're like they seem
quite convinced that this was actually going to be thing so I look into it and it turns out that in 2022 Apple did file a patent for a device that looks to be some kind of case for airpods and this case has a touchcreen and they document the kind of functionality of that touchcreen but the thing to keep in mind when it comes to Apple patents is that the vast majority of their patents don't end up as a product a lot of it is for like experimental or explorative purposes but in this case I feel like
this could actually be a real device and also it's it's also the confidence that those guys seem to have about this whole thing now I have so many questions and thoughts okay uh when you compare it with a real airpod Pro two this is the one with the USBC Port they both have USBC ports they both have a little speaker thing uh they both have the lanyard loop on the right they both have same kind of back metal hinge the button it and when you open it up it's also identical it really is just the
presence of the screen that is the difference also kudos to them for actually fitting a screen onto a case like this I'll be honest I was surprised that this thing could even exist but the question that you have the million-dollar question is why would Apple even put a touchcreen onto airpods in the first place okay so on this mockup the thing that I have here it has some functionality like touchscreen gives you controls namely uh audio controls you can control your music you
get volume controls you get ANC controls so you can like turn your noise cancellation on and off you can enter transparency mode uh and this was all functional that was the crazy thing like you could do all the stuff with these buds that were in here uh there's also an EQ if you want to like crank up your base you can uh there's just a whole bunch of functionality including a find my buds like you could this was all functional right you could just have it out and like it all worked now the sound
quality on these buds aren't great they're not real buds but it was crazy that this was functional now my initial reaction is like okay this is all cool but the one thing that I would have loved to have seen would be the ability for my phone to be able to send media to this thing so it could use like an iPod right but it turns out you can't do that and if you look at the patent filing that also seems to be the case the device that they have there in the patent is only used as a controller
for an external audio Source like your phone or computer that's nearby and then I thought if you need your phone nearby why would you use this like imagine you had the airpods case in one pocket and then your phone in the other pocket in What scenario is it easier or better to use the controls on the case instead of your phone like I just couldn't wrap my heads around and also by introducing a screen onto this thing you now make it more expensive you make it heavier you make it more fra
now the battery has to be bigger to be able to juice all this stuff like it just seems like a really bizarre thing for Apple to even consider that I was just like this seems impossible like actually unlikely now it is Apple they have the tendency to just put screens on things whenever they can because they can like I said the same thing about having the touch bar on the MacBook Pro a few years back I was like why because they can same with the Vision Pro when this thing launched I was like why are
they putting this whole Vision thing on the front like why their screen it makes it more expensive more heavy like the same things right same problems by adding a screen on the front of things but it's what Apple does and they just do it because they can now there's another layer to all this when I used this over the past few days and I tried to kind of Imagine a scenario where I would actually want to use this it it couldn't click for me it just didn't really make sense to me as to why a
screen on an airpod case would be useful however this is not the only device out there and this thing isn't even real there are other products out there right now you can buy that have kind of some kind of wireless earbuds with a screen on the front of the case the most prominent one being from JBL the JBL tour Pro 2 and this device has great reviews but the interesting thing is that even though a handful of these reviews mention a gimmicky screen like you know the screen doesn't do that much
the vast majority of the reviews seem to love the existence of that touchcreen a lot of people are talking about how it's got this extra functionality and the whole time I'm like do do these people not have phones like why is this special so maybe it's something that I just I personally don't get and maybe some of you guys can chime in and be like you know there's awesome functionality to that but I cannot Envision a scenario where if I was in a store and I could choose between two devices right one
with a screen or the one without a screen that's going to be invariably cheaper I would always choose the   unless oh my God as I was saying that sentence I think I something just came into my mind what if okay okay okay okay okay oh my God right now this is a $250 product us the regular airpods Pro 2 now what if the Next Generation the airpods Pro 3 only comes comes with a screened case as in it's the only option what if there is no screenless case that you can buy you have to get a
case with the screen dude I can totally see this they charge you $280 so instead of $250 it's now $280 that $30 bump up in price you get slightly better audio but the big thing is you get a screen now and that justifies that bump up in price for the consumers this totally makes sense cuz also opens up this upgrade tree cuz then the next year they can sell you the the retina version and then the liquid retina version then the one with the notch they got this whole you can do that whole thing now you
see oh my God this this finally makes sense to me this whole time I I just couldn't piece it together but now this scenario actually makes sense because this is a very high margin product right these things are very cheap to produce and they sell for a lot of money but what if you could bump up the price by like 30 bucks when it only cost you maybe five or six dollars more to produce it that would be such an apple thing to do dudes that's got to be it that's got to be why this thing could possibly
exist now whether or not it actually comes out I don't know but it totally makes sense to me now it totally makes sense to me what do you think now I could be totally wrong for some people out there that be like Dave you're completely an idiot there are so many usage cases where having a screen is Awesome on an airpod C educate me please like legitimately I want to know if that's a real thing but what do you think that's my theory for the day hope you guys enjoyed this video
