we need to talk about this device here the rabbit R1 now this isn't going to be some kind of like technical review of this device uh it's more of just a kind of early impressions of it but the reason why I don't want to do a review on it is because like the Humane AI pin this thing is just so underbaked the R1 feels like it's missing so many features that were not necessarily promised but so many features that would make this product what it's supposed to be that at this point I just feel like this product
is not in a reviewable state so what does the R1 do it's a hardware AI assistant but it can eventually learn through its large action model but this instead of being an app is a $200 piece of Hardware so it comes in this plastic case it's actually a pretty nice case it's got this like silicone uh rubber lining to it to kind of keep it protected when it's in the box but the product feels like you would expect a $200 piece of tech to feel it doesn't not feel premium in any shape
way or form uh it is you know it's a lot of plastic not that there's anything wrong with it but it feels like you would expect a $200 device too now the screen it's pretty mediocre the speaker pretty mediocre the camera's interesting it's got this like motorized action to it so when you activate it it flips upwards and then when you're done with it it flips back uh but the scroll wheel is where I want to draw your attention to because I think the scroll wheel is not good now aesthetically and just
visually the scroll wheel is neat I think that scroll wheel on Tech is so rare that it kind of makes it iconic on this product and it's also very teenage engineering it's because they love these infinite encoders that you can spend forever and ever they're kind of neat so visually awesome however you might be asking what does the scroll wheel do okay let me show you so the way that you interact with this device is using this scroll wheel and you can scroll through the menus now the audio
you're hearing is just coming from the speakers it's not like a mechanical click or anything like that it's also there's it's a stepless encoder like there's no notches or anything it just spins infinitely uh and it's kind of cool for the first day or two I was like this is cool I like the analog Vibe of this thing it feels neat it feels fun right but then you're trying to use this thing for real things and not just playing around it's very frustrating to navigate menus with a scroll wheel
exclusively because they don't allow you to touch it's got a touch screen it's got a digitizer I'll show you real quick it's like um get out of here if you go into the terminal you can tap away on a keyboard clearly there's a touchcreen it's got a very weak motor if I might add that but uh when you're in the settings menu or if you're doing any kind of like option stuff and you're just trying to like use your finger to tap at things you can't they lock you out so my question was in
my brain why why don't they just give me access to tapping and I think the main reason why they do this is because if they gave people full access to their UI and settings with tap no one would use the scroll wheel this would just be a Superfluous useless thing but by making you by forcing you to use the scroll wheel now you're scrolling the other thing I found really annoying with the scroll wheel is that you would think with the scroll wheel that you could at the very least adjust the volume in real
time like as an example if you are using your device and you're like I don't know what's the weather like today and searching it's you want to adjust the volume you would want to like tweak it the weather for for can't this is actually a great example I want it to stop right but the way you do is you have to click the side button hold on to it and using your other hand you don't have to adjust the volume I mean maybe you could configure it so you could kind  one-handed no it's a two-hand operation
you got to click it then you got to roll up and now you've adjusted the volume why why like what is the purpose of this just so you can have you like hey our squirrel wheel is actually you useful I want to just tap stuff dude just get rid of the scroll wheel so if I had to redesign this thing this is what I would do first I'd get rid of the scroll wheel completely it's cute but it's just not useful enough to me and then now probably just move the camera on top of the bezel there's a little bit of room
there and then maybe add some Hardware volume buttons it is a speech based device and you might as well extend the screen because you know you got a little bit of room down there and oh look it's a phone like the thing you already have in your pocket and the more I interact with this device the more I'm like 100 ",000% this should be an app and anyone" who says otherwise like there's I keep seeing in the comments about this reason that reason no like just no the reason why this is not an app I already
discussed this in a video but it's a little bit long-winded you watch it if you really care but they can't make this an app and even if they could they wouldn't want to make it an app like Humane and rabbit they wouldn't want to make it an app because it's not profitable okay as I interacted with both these devices over the past couple of weeks another thing that's come to my mind it's a completely separate conversation is how did we get to this stage where reviewers are being sent devices that
are so incredibly underbaked like these are just not ready for the consumer like I don't think these are ready for like early adopters who are willing to just beta test and play with Early Access Hardware like it just it's so raw right now that it just does not make sense and like put it this way the battery of this device probably lasts an hour and a half granted I spoke with the CEO Jesse who saying that there's going to be some kind of uh firmware update in a couple days that should help
with it I imagine it would be these things aren't supposed to last an hour and a half but the fact that it's launched there are people out there who paid money for this device and it's lasting really short it's just it shouldn't be in this state same with the Humane AI pin there's so much stuff that was missing and just not functional right out of the gate the large action model I'm not even going to detail it in this video but if you were expecting to pick up one of these things and being
able to do the things that they demonstrated in their demo when they showed the lamb keep dreaming dude it's not going to happen uh but that's just the nature of this whole product category right now these Hardware AI devices and it's like what is going on and I thought about it I'm like okay the only reason that I can come up with is this and because they had they technically have time right why not just wait a couple months put it out I'll tell you why Google IO is in 3 weeks time Apple's
WWDC I think is in like six weeks Time s weeks time those things are just around the corner and the moment Google and apple put out their versions of like AI based assistants that are hardwired like baked right onto the iOS or Android it's a completely good different conversation for rabbit and Humane they no longer have these like new interesting things they just have these like Derpy pieces of Hardware that ostensibly shouldn't even exist now I'm not saying that these things
suck and will suck forever I I hope that's not the message that's coming across here what I am trying to say is that in their current form these things are so not even ready to be shown to people publicly let alone being sent to reviewers and being reviewed I actually think that this product the R1 didn't even have a review program maybe that's a a sign of what this product really is but they didn't have a review program it just like a bunch of media got some units and if you want to make a video go
for it that's really what it was uh so yeah I think the hardware is neat I got to be honest but it's I don't think that this is the the future of what this technology is supposed to be one other thing that I thought was interesting now that I uh uh now that I've kind of reach the end of this piece as I was using these devices I thought okay you know how we have like a bunch of llms the most popular ones probably Chad gbt uh Perle is the thing that's running on here but like there's
a bunch of AI services that are popular and good and these things are powerful right they're free they're very fun to use and when you use them they're like wow these things can do a lot of stuff but the the usefulness of them is very limited because you cannot just attached chat GPT or like an llm directly like hard baked into your phone right you can't have access to like your I don't know your contacts your emails your text messages your credit card info like if chat GPT could access all of that stuff
it'd be scary right but if it was safe but if it could access all that stuff the utility of these llms would be amazing like you could do a lot of stuff they could be very powerful assistance to your life the thing is I don't think Apple and/or Google will ever allow third-party llms to just be able to connect to their ecosystems to that degree and I've always thought chat GPT like open ai's product is so far ahead of the curve that like it's kind of strange that Google especially Apple
didn't just kind of come up with their own version of the stuff and just publicly launch it and announce it so much earlier but I realized that because Apple and Google hold the key to their ecos systems respectively they control this like they control how much access chat GPT will ever have to their user base and so the moment Apple launches or Google launches their versions of these things and those things are hardwired into the the OS itself those could those could be so much more useful and so much more
powerful than these third party llms so the point I'm trying to make is that I could see in the very near future Google and or Apple's version of these types of products outperforming is becoming way more popular than chat GPT is just because they have access to all that stuff on your phone and they can actually do really cool stuff because that's fun as it is there's a limitation as to how much people can use chat GPT right now okay hope you guys enjoyed this video
