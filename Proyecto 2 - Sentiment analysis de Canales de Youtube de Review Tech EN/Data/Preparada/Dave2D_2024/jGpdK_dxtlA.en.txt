these are Apple's airpods 4 and these far exceed my expectations because they're able to pull off pretty good active noise cancellation without any kind of Rubber seal or anything these are just uh just hard plastic ear tips that fit very comfortably and they're just not what you would expect a typical ANC equipped earbud to be like now I'm going to do a kind of quick review of them as well as compare them to the readily available airpods or Apple Air airpods on the market so we have the uh
airpods 2 the airpods 3 this is the new airpods 4 and I'm also going to compare to the the best version of Apple's airpods the airpods Pro 2 so the airpods 4 there's three kind of features that I think are noteworthy right now so first is that there is an ANC option now you have the option to buy a airpod 4 with active noise cancellation second there's the presence of the H2 chip this time so this helps with that an ANC but also helps with audio and gives special kind of apple features but the third and
arguably the most important feature is that they have a new shape to the airpods 4 that I think massively changes the way that this product is let's start off with a conversation around how these fit so this was the fit of airpods 1 and two it's kind of like the OG Q-tip style longer stem and this fit well because like the tip wasn't very large but the sound quality wasn't great but then airpods 3 came out and this was a very different fit this had a more bulbous shape and it just it it kind of sticks
out of your ear more and you can feel it the moment I put airpods 3 on a few years back I remember thinking this feels worse like the comfort of this is noticeably worse than airpods 1 and two and I think if you look online a lot of people felt the same way obviously fit and feel as subjective but airpods 4 because they've changed the shape of this just enough it's mostly like the tip and the bulbous area this fits entirely differently this I mean it's so much more comfortable the
moment we put this in but this feels more like airpods 1 and two in terms of just how easily it inserts into your ear and also how kind of nicely it just stays there but it still has all the improved audio characteristics of a larger and more bulbous ear tip now I did think it was interesting that during Apple's keynote for airpods 4 they were talking about you know they did all this laser and 3D imaging to be able to get this new design and they had to like scan thousands of ear shapes and at the
time of the presentation I was like how hard could it possibly be but having tried this I realized there's a very big and noticeable difference and just for clarity sake everything we've seen so far in terms of the tips are the regular airpods the pro what has separated them in the past and even now is the presence of a Rubber seal it's like a silicone r rubber that prevents sound from coming in as like a passive seal and also it prevents sound that's produced by the Bud from leaking out and it just helps
with the audio characteristics that you get and this is why you get the best possible sound with their Pro product the Rubber seal but it is uncomfortable for some people to use it because it has to go deeper into your ear canal now quick note about the charging case this is a smaller case than the previous generation it also has USBC charging but there's a few things that are interesting so first the light so if you look kind of like this is uh airpods 3 there's a visible light indicator but
this it's invisible until you actually turn the light on like when the light is off yes you can't even see the indicator at all also if you'll notice the button that was on the back of the previous cases it's a buttonless case now and there's like a touch sensitive area underneath that button that serves as kind of input if you need to connect it manually or reset it uh but there's also it's a wireless uh charging capable case but one thing I noticed is that this does not have magnets or like magave
capabilities you can still charge it wirelessly but the old one you could kind of connect it up and if you had magnets it would hold itself up like if you had a magnetic mag safe charger same with airpods pro2 it can charge magnetically attached but the new one it'll charge but no magnets uh there's also a speaker on the cases here and this allows you to play a chime to find it if you've lost it all right let's talk about sound but do keep in mind that this stuff is very subjective
and also very dependent on the shape of your ear canal and how these things fit and whatnot uh but I would say that airpods 4 sound very good especially for a device that doesn't have the kind of rubber or silicone ear tips that go right into your ear canal and so just a comparison airpods 3 I would say that these have like good mids the trouble was quite good but the base on airpods 3 was just mediocre and in some cases just not present depending on the track you're listening to but airpods 4 the
biggest difference that I noticed was in that base now I'm not sure if it's because there's new drivers or the fit is better but immediately just cross comparison the Bas is way more present on airpods 4 now I don't have great tools to measure their frequency response I'm just using a calibr um mic in Rue so I don't know if I'd even classify these as measurements but this is how airpods 4 Stacks up against some of the current Apple airpod products so it's a noticeable step up from airpods 3
but obviously not as good as the airpods Pro 2 especially in those lower frequencies but do keep in mind that the way that those plots look doesn't always correlate perfectly to how we perceive the sound especially on earbuds that don't have the rubber seals okay let's talk about ANC the active noise cancellation because that is I would say the most impressive impressive thing about these new buds so during the presentation or the keynote when they announced it I was like how good could
it possibly be because most of the noise cancellation or the active noise cancellation devices that I've used the good ones have a Rubber seal it it serves two purposes one you're blocking out the sound that's from the outside right it makes it easier to cancel out any kind of uh environmental noise that you don't want but also when you have a Rubber seal you're able to produce more like stronger sounding base you're able to stronger sounding lower frequencies which is very important when it comes to
actively canceling out sounds right the buds need to be able to produce a sound that's loud enough and in the appropriate frequency to cancel out whatever sound it is that you're trying to kill and airpods 4 is so impressive I think a lot of it comes from the fact that uh it's just better audio capabilities than the previous generation but I think another part of it is the actual contour and shape of the tip I think it's doing a really good job of just like blocking out to the
best of its ability the external sound despite not having a rubber seals so uh when you put them in I was very impressed and it's very difficult to convey this in a video so this is a rough approximation of what you'd hear   I think lower frequency background noises like engines and being on a plane or just Motors rumbling fridges in the background that stuff gets muted very nicely on airpods 4 but the higher frequency stuff like let's say there's like a bunch of kids and they're
squawking and squealing they're having fun that has uh that is muted better on the airpods pro two and I think it's because of that passive seal it just does a way better job at killing that kind of sound uh so I'm impressed and I think that if you're looking at this type of product and you've always wanted an earbud that didn't use a rubber seal because you just didn't like the kind of discomfort of those rubber seals or if you just prefer the hard plastic tip you'll be pleasantly surprised with this
uh okay the other thing microphone quality now just a quick test between all four of them this is the mic on the iPhone 15 Pro Max now I'm talking over ambient noise it's supposed to be like a busy coffee shop and this is what the mic on the phone itself sounds like this is audio being recorded on the mic of airpods 2 now these are an older pair of earbuds they're from 2019 so like 5 and a half years old at this point uh they still work great just the battery life is short this is a mic from airpods 3
the predecessor and this device still Ed the H1 chip on the inside but this is what this sounds like this is a recording from airpods 4 the new newest one and it does have that newer H2 chip in it I imagine it must have better ability to block out the environmental sound but we'll see and lastly we have the mics on airpods Pro too so these also use the H2 chip but because this is a more expensive device and these are like $70 more than airpods 4 I imagine they have like other things like better
mics so this is what these sound like the new airpods 4 have Force touch controls kind of like the airpods Pro 2 but they don't have volume controls on these I why uh last thing pricing so all the pricing of this is like I don't know4 maybe $60 more expensive than competing products and half of it is because of the Apple brand name but the other portion is like it's just the connectivity this is able to connect with uh other Apple devices and switch between Apple devices and even switch
between the different airpods if that's what you're doing very seamlessly and it's strange how good it is compared to every other product on the market but if you live in that Apple ecosystem system it's good for that but in terms of just pricing the truth is there's a ton of competitive products to this just in terms of like audio quality andc capability that is better than Apple's products uh in terms of like the overall package though the convenience and all that stuff these are really good you
just have to pay a little bit more for them okay there you have it I do think that it's from perspective of my personal thing I've always liked the fit of airpods 2o that's why I still keep mine I think these fit my ear the best they don't have the best sound quality but airpods 4 I would say has like the sound quality of not quite the pro two version but it's better than airpods 3 it's like right in between in terms of sound quality but it has way better fit and I think like if you're using these
things for extended period of time fit can make uh it can be very important so yeah much better fitting and for some people much better sounding than their previous products okay hope you guys enjoyed this video
