you guys remember the nothing phones right the phones with the glyph lights on the back of the devices well they have a new phone that branches off the original Line This is the cmf phone one and it's $200 and it's arguably the best phone you can get for this price point but unlike normal phones this was designed to be opened up so if you take a look at the back you see four screws and a fifth thumb screw on the bottom right here and when you remove all the screws and the SIM tray with an SD slot
you can remove the back panel which allows you to change the colors of the device the stock black color and the light green are like a matte finish plastic it's a very smooth texture it's not particularly grippy but the orange and blue these are a softer finish it's like a faux leather material that just has a little bit more grip now you might think that the main idea behind a removable back plate like this would be to allow the user access to the battery so they can swap it out whenever they
need but there's a very clear warning right when you open it up telling you not to do just that and also there's tamper evident tape so if you did open up to remove the battery they would know it is very easy to do it though it's just I don't think the company wants you to do that but in case you're curious this uses the same battery as the one that's in the nothing phone 2A the other thing that the screws a li to do is to attach accessories so there's a foldout kickstand and then a card holder both of
which are kind of okay to me but there is this lanyard that I think is pretty neat it's got this super thick rope and the mounting Point seems very well done so if this is you know something that you're interested in terms of the look it's built right into the phone so these accessories are $25 each which is I think it's fairly expensive considering the phone is only 200 bucks but the cases are $35 and the unfortunate thing is that the base models only come in black and if you want to change the
color you have to spend the money to buy one of these back plates now I do think it's something that they have to do to be able to keep the price of this phone down because for a $200 phone this has surprisingly good components so this has 8 gigs of RAM 128 gigs of storage but the display is really nice it's a 120hz 6.67 in Super AMOLED and it Peaks at "2,000 knits now the bezels aren't super" thin and they're also not even the bottom bezel here is a little bit thicker than the top and sides but the
image is fantastic but also the chip is really good for the price point it's running a mediatech 7300 one of the faster budget chips and it feels really responsive light and even moderately demanding games play well in it but even heavier games like genin and weing waves those need to run at lower settings but they still play very smoothly on this device in regards to the camera system it's a decent shooter but I think I was expecting a little bit more because they had hyped up that 50 megapixel Sony
sensor it shoots well in good lighting conditions but the moment you have like imperfect lighting you lose a lot of the detail I think there's a ton of processing that cooks some of the finer details also it's technically only like a single lens shooter the images are shot off this bottom lens the top top lens is apparently only used for just like depth sensing in portrait photos it doesn't actually shoot images off of that top sensor battery life was quite good which is expected because it is a
"big 5,000 mAh battery uh but a couple" other thoughts the vibration motor here is by default really weak you have to crank it up to like the Mac setting and then it becomes more usable but out of the box it's like strangely weak uh fingerprint sensor is good it's an optical one not ultrasonic but it was fast and responsive but there are some deficiencies so the first one and I'd say the biggest one is that this device doesn't have NFC support So if you use Google pay or any kind of tap payment
system there's also no wireless charging and also the speaker system it's a mono speaker on the bottom so it doesn't sound particularly great and also it's quite easy to cover up that speaker when you're in landscape mode uh but the other big one is that this thing only has two years of major Android updates and 3 years of security updates now over the past week that I've been using this phone I can't help but like this thing more and more and I honestly feel that the regular nothing phones like as cool
as those glyph lights are I'm drawn to them part of me feels that this is what nothing phones should have been like a a more higher tier version of this would just be more broadly appealing not everyone loves lights but I think there's real utility and functionality behind like swappable cases and accessories that attach to this thing uh I just think it's a really neat device and I think because this phone doesn't lean too heavily on this whole gimmick of like accessories because the Basse
phone is so awesome I think it's just it's I think it's cool I think it's a really nice addition to nothing's lineup uh there is one other thing I wanted to show you that was interesting with this launch of the phone came a pair of earbuds uh the thing that's interesting on it is this jog dial so this is a uh it's a earbud system that you open up connects uh it's got seemingly very powerful ANC the base is a little heavy on this thing you're going to have to EQ if you want really good audio quality
but this jog dial is tactile which is always cool but it controls the volume of the stuff you're listening to so obviously on a phone that's nice but you can connect it to like your computer or any kind of home audio system and just control the audio in your pocket which is always nicer than like squeeze controls so I thought that was pretty cool uh but there you have it that's the phone and the earbuds from C MF
