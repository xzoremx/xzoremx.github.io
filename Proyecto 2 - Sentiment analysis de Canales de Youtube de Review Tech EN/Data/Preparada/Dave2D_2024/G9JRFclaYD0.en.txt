this is the year that Windows laptops finally stop sucking cuz we saw some good devices from Intel we saw some really nice devices from Qualcomm but we were all waiting to see what AMD would bring with their new tech so we finally have an allnew chip from AMD inside an all new laptop from Asus the zambuk s16 now the naming around this chip is God awful per huge they went with the AMD ryzen ai9 HX 370 it's a terrible name but there's two chips the 370 at the top end and then the base model the 365 and both
these chips have great performance particularly the 370 and they're also very energy efficient now some thoughts about the design of the Zenbook s16 this is a very thin device it measures in at 12 to 13 mm thick depending on where you throw the caliper but typically when you have a design that is so thin for an x86 laptop you just get bad performance but because of this new chip they enabled you can do it on this device quite well just to keep it super thin uh and also despite it being super thin you still
have two USBC a HDMI as well as uh the USB a and fulls sizee SD on the right side so it's just like I think they've done a good job in terms of the kind of overall package and also the top so this is a they call it a Ser aluminum finish it's a terrible name typical Asus but it is a ceramic polymer that is bonded to the top aluminum layer and it's like it's supposed to make it a little the surface a little bit harder it almost feels like polished concrete or polished Stone also comes in two colors there's a
dark gray which I think looks nice if you don't like this cream color cuz this thing looks sick dude I love it and then the third thing in terms of the design that's interesting to me is this series of holes for the grill so this Grill is mached out with these small holes and then inside those holes are the even tinier holes and you just get a very unique looking design now I would imagine that if you just CN seed this stuff out with larger holes it would be cheaper to produce because there's like
less Machining time and I imagine you would just get better air flow with bigger holes but this is a very unique look and also I've been told that if you spill liquids on this because the holes are so small it's slightly more spill resistant than if you just went with those large large holes but it's a unique look now the screen this is a sweet screen so this is rocking a 16in OLED panel uh both of these have the 16inch OLED panel and I mean they just look so good so it's a very nice screen
in terms of the image quality because it's an OLED panel and it's also a very fast screen 120 HZ refresh rate with a response time that's well under a millisecond and the color is on point and it's a touchcreen so there's pencil support I think some configurations include a pen in the Box uh the base ones don't but this is an awesome screen in regards to Performance I tested out both the 365 chip as well as the HX 370 chip and on both these devices the default power settings at 17 watts and
if you bump it up to the highest performance mode it's at 28 Watts on both of them now this chip that's inside these things they're able to go up to 54 Watts obviously you need a thicker device to pull it off but in some devices I'm sure some companies will ramp it up to that power setting but the thing is even at this lower or reduced power you're getting really good performance these are really energy efficient chips and because it's such an energy efficient device the heat output
is not a lot and the fan noise is very quiet and it's the main reason why they're able to keep this device super thin and when they first showed this device to me last may like a few months ago I I didn't believe that they'd be able to do it I remember looking at the device and I'm like okay it's amd's new chip I felt like it was going to be too thin I looked at the device back then I was like there's no way like how can you keep a device this thin and get like the expected performance that the world is
used to when it comes to an AMD ryzen chip but it's here and it's good and if you take a look inside there's a super thin Vapor chamber on top of the chip as well as some graphite sheets and there's also a pair of fans and you just get really Solid thermal performance for a device so thin even in games now there's two different gpus depending on the chip that you get on the base chip the 365 you get a Radeon 880m and then on the higher tier chip you get the 890m this just has more compute units than the
base model and these are a noticeable step up from the previous generation of amd's onboard GPU the 780m now if you're playing light titles these are awesome if you're playing like moderately demanding games it's an okay GPU but keep in mind this is an onboard GPU running at relatively low wattage on super thin devices so I'm impressed in terms of what they're able to pull off but if you want like crazy good gaming performance these won't give it to you you still have to get uh discrete gpus
from Nvidia or AMD now in terms of video editing performance if you're curious like I was the HX 370 with its higher core count is actually surprisingly good at it again it's a super thin system so if you want something that's like very portable this will do the job uh better than you might expect now despite its good performance there is one thing that I would say is a thermal kind of limitation on this device the keyboard gets warm when you're using it it doesn't get uncomfortably hot but it is
something that I noticed pretty early on in my testing is like if you're playing games or something or if you're doing a video edit on either of these machines I just don't think this device was thick enough to get the heat off of the keyboard as well they have a graphite sheet that helps uh but it's designed right now perfectly in terms of like sustaining performance so it doesn't throttle aggressively but it's a warm keyboard and I do think that if they made it a little bit thicker they could
have solved that now the keyboard itself it's back lit nicely like uh I'll just show you real quick it is a very bright backlight which I like seeing uh it's a very fast keyboard to type on I'm very comfortable on it but it doesn't feel as responsive as I would hope I think that the the key travel is a little bit shallow and I think again it's just a super thin device and this is just what they had to do if I'm being honest I wish they had made this device like one or 2 mm thicker I think it wouldn't have
changed the kind of form factor there like it's still been a very thin device but I think it's just that extra millimeter or two they would have been able to have a more responsive feeling keyboard and I think they would have fixed the warm keyboard thing that I'm talking about the trackpad is nice and big and it's centered in the middle of the device because there's no number pad on the side but there's a feature on the device that allows you to kind of slide up and down on the edge of the devices
to control things like brightness if you go on the right as well as volume on the left but these are both just I feel like they're just underbaked because I don't get a responsive feel out of them I'd rather just hit the buttons and just be accurate on my brightness and volume control here I'm just like sometimes it works and then sometimes I'm just moving the cursor I think a software update would fix it but it's just something I noticed uh the speakers very good I think Asus has just figured out how to
do good speakers on laptops like so the G14 and g16 their gaming devices also had killer speakers and same idea here just way better sounding than basically the rest of the laptop industry right now so uh they got that going I would actually say that the s16 sounds better than at least a 15-in MacBook Air if you're just directly comparing kind of thin and light devices but these don't sound as good as the 16-in MacBook Pro speakers the battery takes up a big portion of the internal space and this
is a 78w hour battery now over the past couple of years AMD chips were the best choice when it came to just having long battery life Windows laptops and it's just even better now because this generation of Chip is just super energy efficient so you'll notice the biggest gains when you're just doing light tasks so if you're browsing the web or checking email just doing stuff that isn't particularly intensive on the chip it's going to last a very long time on the Zenbook now something I just thought
I would mention if you noticed I had some gaming laptops on that TR it's because I'm trying to match battery size like this is a particular battery size I try to match the battery size when I do comparisons and sometimes I have to dig into the pile of gaming laptops I obviously disabl the gpus to do it but that's just how I do my testing I've always done it with battery size matching uh okay one last thing bring it up real quick is topic of AI because a lot of the marketing around this chip is
about the npu components going up to $50 tops but we have yet to see some kind of killer app or killer feature from Microsoft which utilizes that npu that makes me go okay everyone should be going getting laptops with npu capabilities uh the other thing I thought was strange is that this device despite it having 50 tops npu is not a co-pilot plus laptop like only the Snapdragon X Elite devices are maybe this comes in time but it's seemingly just a regular laptop to Microsoft at
this point in time uh okay so overall very good device I want to talk about the price $13.99 it is expensive it is priced definitely as a premium product and 1399 is the base model the the HX 370 equipped one with more RAM and stuff is uh I think it's like $2 or $300 more now when it comes to a product like this I'm not going to be the guy that's be like this is you should buy this or you shouldn't buy this like what you buy is entirely up to you depending on your budget okay but I think that because
this thing is so thin and because right now there's nothing else on the market that has this kind of performance with an x86 chip that can do what this thing can do so I think it's just priced like that because they know they have something fairly unique and because it's kind of like a premium finish and premium Aesthetics they can do that I think that that's what you get when you come to Market with something fresh like this uh but I do think that if you're on the market for something that's super
thin like this the this will not disappoint this actually delivers way more than I thought it would it's quite impressive but I think if you're on a tighter budget you just wait a little bit there's going to be other devices out there that won't be as nice but they'll be cheaper okay so there you have it that's the zambuk s16 with the new chips from AMD
