what if I told you that this device here this tiny piece of metal with no moving Parts could produce an air current silently and it's a strong enough current to cool a laptop you would think it was impossible right you'd be like this it doesn't exist there's no way okay let me do a quick demonstration so this technology is inside this little box here it's right in this section here I'm going to lay down some  it's crazy and it's silent like no sound and the best part about this whole
technology I saw a fully functional laptop with this inside it it was running off of this cooling technology and this device was built by a very big company very well-known company they're going to be showcasing at CS in a couple weeks so this technology comes from a company called ventiva they've made a solid state cooler that is unlike anything I've seen before but to appreciate what's really going on here we got to go back in time a little bit 2 years ago there was a product that made
headlines it was a product from a company called FR and they made something called the airjet and I chose not to cover their Tech let me explain why the air jet used a technology that was like basically vibrating material so they would take these pzo electric membranes and they would flap them very "quickly 24,000 times a second and when" you vibrate them like that you're able to create an air current now the technology very neat and I did a demo with it I I was briefed on it and I
never made a video on it because there was one huge problem that technology at least at the time was very energy inefficient so just some numbers a typical laptop fan something like this this uses one watt of energy to produce about 1.3 to maybe 1.5 CFM obviously it varies basing on design and whatever but around that right 1.3 to 1.5 for one watt of energy the fro the air jet used one watt of energy for 0.2 CFM very little air flow for that type of energy so if you're using it for
laptops I mean that was the that was the goal right that was the dream to able to use something like that it just didn't make sense and when I looked at the numbers I'm like there's no way this is ever going to be picked up by a laptop company anytime soon and two years later we still do not have any laptop companies that have touched it because Energy Efficiency also there's issues with like vibrations and stuff when you're flapping things at that kind of rate there is one product that uses it
it's a desktop with unlimited power because that plugs right up to the wall but the whole idea of Energy Efficiency does not work well with that airjet product okay now since that thing was announced I've been approached by multiple companies saying they have oh you know we got some new solid state cooler they've all been that type of tech so I've kind of been jaded to this whole idea of a solid state cooled laptop then two two weeks ago I hear about there this new product being
demoed at show at CS that uses a different kind of technology and apparently there was like a laptop being built with it so I'm like okay let me see this I go to the website and it is in fact an entirely different method of cooling it's actually solid state there's no moving parts and it works through the ionization of air molecules so they have these harmonica looking things they call them their ionic cooling engine and inside each one of these they have a wire and a grill and
these act as two electrodes so when you run a high enough voltage through that wire it ionizes the air around it so stuff that we breathe like oxygen nitrogen those are now ionized they are missing an electron and now those ionized molecules are very reactive they're trying to replace that missing electron so they're attracted to the negatively charged Grill so you got these ionized air molecules that jump over to that Grill and the act of that jumping creates a little bit of wind but
then you multiply by billi ions and trillions of air molecules that are just doing this at the same time now you have some real air flow it's a very crude representation of what's going on here but that's essentially what it is you have air molecules that are being ionized and then immediately deionized and that process creates air flow it's crazy but it works so I'm looking through their press material it all seems very impressive and I reach out to them like can you show this thing to me
you you guys have like functional things that I can see and they come up and they show me a functional laptop the company that built this like the company that built this laptop like everyone knows this company it's a very well-known company you'll see it at CS I wish I could show to but it's not time yet but the technology behind it was crazy I was I was running Prime 95 and looking at Hardware info completely normal clock speeds it's a powerful chip and like there's no sound there's no moving Parts
it it's wild like think about it for a second you're creating wind you're creating airf flow from nothing it's like a piece of metal and it's like there's wind there's air flow coming out of it it's crazy it's so freaking crazy the more talk about this I'm like now I'm like vocalizing my thoughts I'm like this is nuts this is like in my mind this is a game-changing technology that fundamentally changes what laptops can and I think should be and in addition to showing me that working laptop they also
demonstrated the airf flow using a more elegant device than the one that I showed earlier now keep in mind that using smoke machine like this is visually exaggerative because smoke particles follow fluid dynamics like when you look at that video it might seem like it's hair dryer air flow it's not it's much more modest than that but it's a lot more air flow than the air jet and much more energy efficient at doing it so like I said a regular laptop fan moves around 1.5 CFM per watt the
airjet from FR their product does 0.21 CFM per watt vena's ionic Tech does around one CFM per watt so it's not as energy efficient as a regular laptop fan but it's essentially silent and it's small so this is the size of a typical laptop fan and the larger you go the quieter you can run it but the reason why size is so important when it comes to fans and stuff is that these things dictate how you design laptops like because these things have to be in there to cool them for most laptops you have
to take that into consideration when you figure out like how big of a battery is it how big is the whole product like the whole thing revolves around thermal design right and that's how big they often are now the fro airjet was quite a bit smaller and because it was so small I think that's why it was so exciting to a lot of people because it's like if you can shrink it down to this size that changes things but Energy Efficiency problems now the tech from ventiva is different they can make them in custom
lengths and stuff but these little metal components are not enough you need a couple other things first you need some kind of housing like in this example here uh this is actually housing the middle sized one that you saw previously and this was the thing that was inside the machine that I showed you earlier but this little housing serves two purposes one it serves to kind of direct the air flow as it generates it but also it acts as like a kind of a small Faraday cage because that electrode wire
generates an electromagnetic field that you have to contain using a faraday cage type product like this uh but in addition to the housing you also need to have a power supply so in order to operate this thing you need to be able to generate a high enough voltage very low current but a high volt voltage be able to uh create the ionization capabilities of that wire and this is it here now this is an older I guess older generation of this thing they're actively shrinking down more and more
and supposedly have several in development that are significantly smaller than this but each one of these power supplies can operate several of those harmonica looking things these little uh uh what they call them ionic cooling engines and I think this one in particular can do three but they have other ones that can do more like five and six whatever but the idea is that you need one of these for several of these cooling things that you can place around the laptop but as you shrink that
the whole thermal solution becomes smaller and smaller and even in its current state like this like older generation I have in front of me right here this is already smaller than most fans now there are three kind of obstacles that I think this product has right now so the first one is the cost so a typical laptop fan is so cheap like these are a dollar to $3 or for you know what I'm saying like it's like single digit dollars so even the most custom Solutions out there with like finely
tuned fins and stuff like these are very inexpensive a new solution like this like out of the gate with low volume I wouldn't be surprised if this is like an extra40 or $50 cost for the manufacturers it's like it's a lot more than fans so I feel like when that pricing trickles down to Consumers it's going to be a decent step up just this is like based on very little laptop engineering knowledge but that's just my thinking uh but the other thing is Ozone so when you ionize air when especially
with oxygen molecules in our atmosphere you have the potential to create ozone like o03 now I spoke to them about this because right when they demoed this I was like wait you're ionizing air isn't there right isn't there o03 and so they have a solution they say that they're using magnes dioxide as a catalyst on the like the copper or like I guess on the heat sink or the th area and it just acts as a catalyst to facilitate the conversion of that ozone back to oxygen immediately now they've supposedly done
some testing with like UL standards and apparently it's all good up on the up and up and now that I'm saying this out loud I do think that in order for that company to have picked this thing up and make a laptop with this it probably passed all the certification but it's just a thought that IE and I also did ask them like dust and all that stuff and they apparently have solutions for all these things it's just all under patents I don't they didn't explain the details of it but a lot of that is
solved but the third and I think the biggest obstacle with this it comes down to static pressure so static pressure is I guess it's the it's the ability for a fan to continue pushing air even if there's resistance so a typical laptop fan these things have like I'd say like 40 to maybe 50 pascals of static pressure so that's like the higher the better because that means that you can push the air through a lot of uh heat like fins you can suck air through a lot of like tiny holes this is okay the fro
air jet product one of its main strengths was very high static pressure "I think that was like 1,700 way above so" that had the ability to like suck air from really far away uh not particularly energy efficiently but it could do it this product here the ventiva has a static pressure rating of 12 so significantly lower than like the 40 or 50 of a laptop fan and because of that there's one limitation to this one big limitation to this so if you'll notice from the demo unit earlier the air
intake holes are really close to the ionic cooling engine itself and they've done that just to minimize the amount of resistance that the air is going to get to be able to flow in through that device and out and the reason why this whole idea of like static pressure is an issue is that when it comes to the typical laptop design right now like this is uh an Asus product so these this right here this is air intake and it sucks air in through here and then out the back of the device the exhaust but
this this this like main intake Grill area is not the only area that air flows through this system like obviously the main intake is here but even like the device itself when you pop it open there are little gaps all across the keyboard and air flow goes to the keyboard and even up top there's like a you know this is stylistically designed but there's air that's going through these little grills that get exhausted out of the back but the reason why this device is able to suck air from all those little
tiny holes is because the static pressure of those two fans is reasonably high now there are even devices out there like laptops with actually seal off the like the intake here because they want air to flow in a very particular way through like other sources and that's just the way that laptops are designed you're you're getting that air to flow across multiple components before it gets exhausted but because the static pressure of this device is so low you lose that capability you don't have the ability to
like suck air from really far small holes all across the laptop before it goes in through the ionic mechanism and because of that I think that if you just build a laptop using this technology with no change to the components and where things are placed you lose a lot of the efficiency in order to take real advantage of this you need to just redesign a laptop completely with components moved into different areas so that you don't need to rely on strong static pressure to be able to just make
proper use of this type of cooling technology and I think that's why a lot of their press material shows coolers on different edges of the laptop but I look at this Tech and I'm just super excited to see what other companies do with this technology like I I think I if I had to bet I feel like this changes the trajectory of laptops I really think that this type of tech is like it feels tangible it's real like it already is tangible like I I saw one but it just feels proper it doesn't feel like Vapor
Weare like I'm not saying that fr was vaporware I feel like they had good intentions but just like the technology and the physics behind it with you hit a wall like energy can't you can't beat physics but here the physics they already work so all right there you have it I hope you guys look at this and don't think I'm crazy like I'm so excited by this I hope you guys are as well
