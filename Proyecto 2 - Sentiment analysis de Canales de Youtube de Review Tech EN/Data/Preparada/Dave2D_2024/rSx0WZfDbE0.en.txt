every time a new arm chip comes out for Windows devices it's been disappointing for me like over the past few years their track record has been so bad that I just stopped caring about arm-based Windows laptops I stopped reviewing them because I didn't I didn't want to waste my time and your time showing you devices that just are not great so when Qualcomm announced their new trip the Snapdragon X Elite and they hyped the hell out of it there's a part of me that was interested because it was the paper
spec looked amazing but then there was a bigger part of me that was like this is is this thing going to suck like it has always sucked turns out it's awesome like straight awesome really good performance even when emulating x86 awesome battery life like crazy good battery life and the pricing is surprisingly good like this is a device you get an OLED screen and this is like cheaper than MacBook a it's like this is so good okay let's get into it so this device here Asus Vivo book S15 really
good example of what this chip can do and I think this Chip is going to change the trajectory of what Windows laptops are going to be all right the performance is really fast in synthetic benchmarks the S15 is on par with basically any of the top tier laptops right now and if you compared to what Apple has it's in between what a MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro can put out now when I tested it in workflows with apps that are natively built for arm you get really nice performance on this device
now none of these apps really stood out as being faster than expected like they weren't beating their x86 counterparts but there were no obvious deficiencies when it came to performance on Native arm apps but then the more important question is how does this device perform when it comes to emulation like when you take an x86 app one that hasn't been optimized for arm and you run it on this machine and surprisingly it's still really good it isn't perfect like there is an obvious performance hit when you
run x86 apps but it is so much better than anything I would have expected from Windows at least compared to what we've seen in the past also considering the confidence that Microsoft and their Hardware Partners seem to have in this chip and this launch I would be I just expect developers to get on board with this very soon like you can just tell that there's a much stronger push to this new arm ecosystem than there ever has been when it comes to Windows now in terms of Graphics the raw capabilities
of the onboard GPU are decent it depends on the Benchmark you throw at it but at the time of shooting this there aren't a lot of native arm apps that really lean on the GPU Photoshop from Adobe can and that's been updated to natively run on arm and the performance is pretty much on par with what we've seen from x86 chips now the other fairly popular Adobe app Premiere which is used for video editing is only available as an x86 app currently they are working on an ARM version but even in emulation mode and
this is the thing that blew me away it is completely usable on the Viv book S15 so I remember like a year and a half ago I remember doing I was going to shoot a video on the the Microsoft Surface Pro that you like the the sq3 chip like the Qualcomm chip that was supposed to be really good and I remember trying to emulate premiere on that thing and it was just God awful and that was the moment like right when that happened I was like I'm not going to I'm not doing this anymore I'm not going to I'm not
going to review these devices when it can't even handle x86 apps in a usable manner I mean look how bad that sq3 chip performed but now with Snapdragon X Elite it is totally viable I have to be clear here I'm not trying to say that you know emulated apps are the future and that they're awesome they're they're never going to be as good as a native app but the fact that you don't have to depend on a developer to make your app run on this thing natively you don't have to depend on that interaction to be
able to use your stuff like it just apps work also games now these are not gaming machines but just out of curiosity I tested it out this device can pump out respectable frame rates even in emulation now I did notice that a bunch of games were automatically upscaled so some of the image quality was blurry there's also occasional stutter in the games I don't think it's Stutter from like a hardware thing I'm convinced it's completely a software issue because The Thermals were fine uh and sometimes you
go for a long stretch like just sustained frame rate but eventually you get a stutter and for I think for like casual games was perfectly fine but if I was trying to play like a competitive shooter like a ranked competitive OverWatch game this is not usable like I wouldn't I wouldn't be comfortable playing on this machine but I think that just gets resolved over time with software tweaks now the other thing is fan noise and thermals the Viva book S15 isn't completely silent it does have a
pair of fans on there but it's so quiet compared to what you would typically get in this space with this kind of performance like if you're watching a show or just doing some like light browsing on the net the fans will literally be inaudible maybe if you stick your ear right up to the Bottom Grill like you could maybe hear something then but it's for all intents and purposes a silent casual Computing experience but if you do need to step it up and you want to play some games or do
some kind of heavier Computing task the fans will ramp up and even then it's still really quiet now the other thing the big thing for me is battery life the battery life on the Viva book S15 is really good it's better than anything we've seen from Intel including their new core Ultra stuff it's better than anything we've seen from AMD it's very similar to the battery life that Apple has going on for their MacBooks but because the Vivo book has a differen sized battery it's difficult to compare
it directly to that but just in general the battery life with this new chip especially on the S15 is like way better than what we've seen in the past the other thing is sleep so typically when it comes to Windows laptops and you put them to sleep it's very common for Batteries to continue to drain even when the device is supposed to be asleep but on this new Snapdragon X Elite chip I saw 2% sometimes just 1% battery drain overnight which is just the way that battery drain should be if we're being
honest here uh okay so this screen is an OLED panel and it is so good for the price so this is a 120 HZ very color capable OLED screen it's fast it's bright and it also has a webcam with a physical shutter on the top so you can close it up for privacy but this type of display is just not you can't get a screen like this on an regular x86 laptop right now for this kind of pricing so this is a $12.99 machine you get 16 gigs of RAM it is baked on boards you can't upgrade that we also get one
tab of storage that is readily upgradeable because you have full access to the internals uh also you get an amazing selection of ports like on a device of this caliber you don't expect ports like this you get two USB a two USBC uh HDMI micro SD and it's just like such a solid overall system and then the keyboard so this keyboard I do like the way that the keyboard types I'm pretty fast on it and you get a number pad on the right it's a narrow one but you do get number pad but I don't like the
backlighting so uh when the back lighting is off the Legends are quite visible like all the lettering and the numbers you can see it but the moment you turn the back Lighting on uh in certain lighting conditions it's actually harder to read and it's just because of just the color of the back lighting and the color of the keys it's it's not ideal and I feel like they should have learned their lesson from the original like G14 when they the Rog devices they had a keyboard and a
lighting system like this and I think a lot of people complained but I'm just surprised that they continued with that style of lighting and key colors on this device it is RGB backlighting but the colors never seem particularly vibrant to me now my overall take on the Vivo book S15 this product with its awesome screen and great performance and really good battery life like this couldn't exist at this kind of price point if it wasn't for the chip like the Snapdragon X Elite chip
really defines what the Windows laptop experience can be like you just couldn't do this before certainly not for $12.99 now I think Microsoft has a work cutout for them in order for this product to launch in the manner that I think it should in the manner that it deserves there needs to be a lot of polish on Microsoft's end to make everything just extra nice now if you'll notice I did not mention anything to do with co-pilot plus so that's one of the features of this new chip it has AI capabilities
baked into the hardware from the npu that allowed to interact with cool new software from Microsoft however at the time of shooting this that software is not retail ready I've seen it I'd love to talk about it it's really cool stuff but it's not ready yet that'll be a future video but just based on the merits of the hardware alone and what this chip is capable of I really think these new chips and the S15 are something special okay hope you guys enjoy this video
