every year when Google launches their pixel devices the hardware updates feel underwhelming like it's just small incremental updates from the previous generation and we're used to it that's just how the pixel devices have always been but this year on the pixel 9 devices Google has outdone themselves we now have arguably the least impressive Hardware bump we've ever seen on the pixels like it's so minimal and yet it was accompanied with a $100 price increase across the board so we got to
talk about them I was able to spend a little bit of time with all the new pixel devices including three slab phones and one new foldable the naming around the three slab phones is a little bit confusing so there's the pixel 9 the pixel9 pro and then the pixel9 pro XL the XL though is not some like extra large pixel Pro it is but it's actually the size that we've always been used to it's like the size that we had last year on the regular pixel Pro so this right here is last year's pixel 8 Pro and then
this is this year's pixel 9 Pro XL they're the same size and even the screen sizes are pretty much the same between them the new sized phone is actually the pixel 9 Pro and it's a size that didn't exist before but Google thought it was worth it to do so it's here now a smaller version of the pixel Pro product it's actually the exact same size as a pixel 9 but the screen on the pro is actually a little bit bigger because it has thinner bezels the design is a little bit different this year on
the pixel9 devices they're just a more boxy aesthetic so the curved back that we saw on the pixel 7 Pro as well as the pixel 8 Pro this is like not that they're exactly the same but they had the same kind of curved back idea that design is now gone and been replaced with a flatback now if you look at the the previous generation compared to the pixel 9 Pro the new pixel9 Pro definitely looks more like iPhone like in terms of just that flat back but it's still very pixel so the big thing is
this camera hump now the camera hump used to have I mean if you look at the previous two generations the pixel 7 Pro and the pixel 8 Pro these both had a camera bar that ran across the full back and this bar was like a part of the frame like this metal frame would come into the camera bar right it was just this iconic design that the pixel devices have had over the past couple years the new pixel9 Pro that bar is gone like there just now a hump that protrudes from that back glass and I
think it looks cleaner but it's not as visually memorable to me as the previous generations now in terms of the thickness the new pixel 9 Pro is actually a little bit thinner than the pixel 8 Pro but it may not seem like that on camera just because the curvature of the older phones just kind of gives an illusion of a thinner device but when you throw calipers on it this is slightly thinner as well as being a little bit heavier on the scale now the pro comes in a few colors and it has a
matte finish to that back glass the metal rail still has a polished finish like the previous generations uh but the hazel color on the pro device was look really nice to me it's like a matte gray finish I love the look of that the regular pixel 9's like the non-pros have more colorful options so the two most interesting colors to me are the winter green and the PE these look really nice the PE in particular is like a really vibrant pink and it's just not what you typically get with Google's pixel
devices now the new screens are brighter than the previous generation when you look at paper specs but when I was at that Google event it was actually really hard to tell the differences apart now I think it was because of the lighting there it wasn't bright enough for the screens to really pop but I will say that the bezels are a little bit thinner this year and might I just add that they're even bezels around the whole device it's not a big deal to be honest but it is interesting to me because
Google never did it before on the pixel phones and it is a more expensive thing to do right you got to get the flexible oleds that can wrap around like that so it's interesting but regardless it's a very nice looking screen and if you want to protect it with tempered glass you can use the dbrand glass product goes right up to the edge super clean install but the pixel9 device with the biggest screen is the new pixel fold except instead of it being called the pixel fold 2 it's the pixel 9 Pro fold now
it's noticeably thinner than the first pixel fold and it also has a new Snappy hinge but the one thing that they changed that I was surprised and honestly disappointed by is that they changed the aspect ratio of the whole device like the front screen and the inside screen so the original pixel fold was quite unique like it was a more Stout and short device and you could easily oneand operate that front screen and it was just different from most of the other foldables on the market
particularly the Samsung foldables but the new pixel9 Pro fold is a taller device with a taller screen so it's a little bit less onand operable I also will say that the thicker bezels and like the very visible crease were surprising to me at this stage like a "2024 foldable that's $1,800 at the base" uh I don't know I was expecting I was hoping for something a little bit more up todate and they did show a new feature that has like these animations that you can play on the front screen to
attract the attention of like a very young child or maybe some of the tension problems and you uh when the animation goes you can snap the picture it's a very kind of like Niche scenario that that would be useful for but it is something that I haven't seen before on other devices at least not yet now all of these new phones will be running a new chip from Google the tensor G4 I wasn't able to Benchmark this stuff at the event but from all the leaks we've seen it's like a very mild performance
bump from the previous generation like maybe 10% better than the G3 uh but same with storage the kind of Base storage for all these devices remains unchanged from the previous generation and Camera hardware for the most part it's unchanged like there are some updates of notes like the front-facing cameras have been updated those are supposed to be better uh and there's some new software features that I'm assuming comes from the new chip all this stuff will be tested in the review but for the most
part camera Hardware just didn't have any big Hardware changes on the main sensors the battery sizes are like fractionally larger than the previous generation at least on the slab phones but on the folding phone is actually a little bit smaller than the previous generation the optical fingerprint sensors we've seen for years on Pixel devices have been replaced with an ultrasonic one which should be much more reliable but the biggest change at least the most interesting Hardware change to
me is actually the Ram size so the pixel 9 like the base regular pixel 9 that's not at 12 gigs of RAM and the pixel 9 Pro devices have 16 gigs of RAM which is a crazy amount of memory for a phone and the reason for all this Ram is because of Google's AI Endeavors particularly through Google Gemini I was shown a few things there's two that came to mind the first one that they showed me was some camera feature called add me and the idea behind this is that in situations when you are with a friend or with a
group of people and you want a photo of everybody there someone from your group has to go out and take a picture and then that person who took the picture he's left out in the photo like he's not in the photo because he took it and the idea behind this feature is that you can do a little bit of swapon and the software will Stitch it together and give you a composed picture where everybody is in it and it's neat so uh I tried it out with MADD huya and I took the first photo and then we swapped and
it's kind of neat how that first photo shows up as like a 3D object in the camera app so you can use it as guidance to match up the framing and this is what we got all right you good yeah go for it it dude it worked a little we were pleasantly surprised like there's some very clear artifacting going on and some hover hand but it was a a neat thing that did solve a problem for some people right it's not for everyone it's a very Niche case but it is interesting and I do think that
the extra memory that's on these devices helps be able to pull those off because you do need to load that photo in like a 3D space while you're shooting it so maybe that's what the ram was for now the other AI feature that they demoed was much more interesting to me so this was called pixel screenshot and the idea behind this is that like for people with smartphones that take a bunch of screenshots here and there to either like remember something or if they're just interested in something or
just want to be able to recall it in the future usually that pile of screenshots just grows and grows and if you ever do need to recall something it's just it's very difficult to kind of go through all of th those screenshots and find the thing that you're looking for but with this new AI feature you can search through those screenshots with some conversational prompts and I tested out a few times sometimes it worked really well other times not so much but it's like a very early beta right now but my
first reaction was this is neat There's real utility to something like this granted there's some privacy concerns right it has access to your screenshots now it's supposedly all done on device but it is Google and I'm imagining you know if you're taking screenshots you're probably interested in those things and now Google knows that you're interested in those things so technically they have a a really nice Avenue to just send you more targeted ads based on your screenshot collection
but overall I think it's useful but then the second reaction I had was like wait a minute how is this the like the headlining feature of this new pixel phone launch like how is this what they're opening with isn't there something more like this is a phone with 16 gigs of RAM it's got fourth generation tensor chip supposed to be awesome for machine learning and the pixel 9 Pro devices include a one-year subscription to Gemini Advance like there's very there there's a lot of AI
capability here this is this is it like come on there's got to be something more now I spoke to the people at the Google event uh the pre-briefing and they's like yeah there's going to be other features that are announced during the the launch but why weren't they shown in advance now my feeling is that a lot of stuff isn't ready a lot of stuff is kind of like it's Google right the way they kind of Brew things over time and then kind of release it but I'm just surprised that the phone is as
expensive as it is actually no I take that back the price kind of makes sense to me just based on the RAM and just based on you know the way that Google does aggressive sale pricing and stuff but what doesn't make sense to me is just how limited the AI capabilities that they presented seemed to be just out of the gate now I hope that over time this stuff becomes awesome and I hope that by the review embargo lift that there's some real stuff we can talk about but right now it's like it just
feels a little underbaked anyways uh that's my kind of early thoughts on the Google pixel 9 devices hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it
