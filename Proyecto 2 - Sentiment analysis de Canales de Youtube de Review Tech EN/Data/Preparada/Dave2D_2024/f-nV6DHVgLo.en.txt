all right so Apple launched some new iPads today and they invited me out to New York to check them out they are I mean they're they're iPads now as I was playing with them earlier the first thing that just kept running through my mind is like this thing that I'm playing with the iPad Pro with that new pencil Pro is I think the most advanced piece of tech that Apple has in their entire like consumer product lineup more advanced than their laptops like all their it's just it's crazy it's so wild
but it's just an iPad it's like it's so strange to me that their most advanced Consumer Electronic is a tablet now the reason why I say it's like the most advanced piece of tech that Apple makes is for a bunch of things first that screen there's just so much happening to be "able to pull off a 1,000 nit sustained" brightness OLED panel like you crank it up to full brightness full screen white pixels that's a th000 nits it's like all the photons just just blasting into your
eyes right it's super bright and the way that they've done it is the tech so first the OLED is a tandem OLED display like there's two emission layers so it can get significantly brighter uh but to pull that off you need to have a display driver that can do it in an energy efficient way that doesn't just burn out those pixels like I think if people wanted to if companies wanted to anybody could make a thousand nit display it's just that it would have Burnin issues within hours of using it right but
Apple's pulled it off the way that you prevent burning I think is to use that tandem OLED Tech but then in order to drive that those two displays or those two layers you need to have the type of tech that's in that M4 chip to be able to have the Energy Efficiency to make the display drivers be able to pull it off like it's just so much stuff has to be in the right place and the right "timing to make that display hit 1,000" nits sustained and they've done it and it is a very bright screen now visually
when I look at that panel it doesn't look special in terms of like the actual image quality if you look at like a Samsung Tab S9 Ultra that's an also a really nice display but that thing hits like five maybe 600 nits Peak at uh fur like sustained right so it's really just the brightness that you're getting out of this Tech but it's very impressive that they're able to do it and even laptops like the latest laptops those hit like also five maybe 600 for sustained brightness it's really hard to
"hit 1,000 the thing to keep in mind" "though 1,000 knits isn't double the" brightness of 500 it's like you double the knit count you maybe get 25 maybe 30% more perceived brightness but it's still a really bright screen um and then when it comes to HDR content because it hit 1600 Peak like for like little parts of the screen hitting 1600 nits it's a really nice looking screen but then on top of that these iPad Pros are super thin the 131 in particular is like crazy thin 5.1 mm the 11in is a little bit
thicker but they're both very thin and light and then also the M4 chip again it's crazy that the M4 chip first appeared in a tablet but it's here and very energy efficient supposedly and also really strong performance it seems like a really good chip but I think that's something you need to test uh extensively and I'll probably get into that in my review the other thing that was really neat so those displays they have an option for this Nano texture it's like a it's like a a finish that is
a slightly diffused kind of coating or a diffused finish on the top of it now the first thing I thought was like when I saw it in the announcement I was like there's no way they're allowing people just you scratch a pencil on it right like the apple pencil because they have a coating like that a kind of matte finish for their uh Studio display unlike the xdr display and those finishes on their monitors are so delicate they Supply a very special like cleaning cloth for it and it's just like
a it's a delicate finish but on the iPad I know it's not the exact same finish but they're just allowing people to just you just use your pencil no problems you just scratch away it and I was like wow now I mean it's obviously not for everyone a coding like that I do think that when I was looking at the image it's not as sharp as like a regular glossy finish but for a lot of people like you could see in the demo like in that area where shooting a lot of overhead lights the pot lights
and they're just reflecting off these screens like crazy but on the uh on that matte coating or that matte finish it's just like a a nice reduction in glare so if that's the kind of work environment that you're in or if the that's just what you're after they now have that option interestingly it doesn't like that coating doesn't go around the whole screen it's only on the display portion itself like the bezel they've kept it uncoated or unfinished which I think from a design choice is kind of neat but
it's like I can't really oh I just it's because of the the front facing camera because if they put a coding on the camera the it just be you'd be looking at a fuzzy image the whole time and speaking of the cameras for all of the iPads the front-facing camera is now mounted on that landscape Edge uh the other thing I thought was really neat was that pencil so the new Apple pencil Pro the most interesting thing to me is that new squeeze capability like you can squeeze it as a gesture and now it can
pull up menu in certain apps so the developers have to do it like they have to implement that API so that when you squeeze it you can do certain things in apps but that brings so much more utility to the apple pencil that just it couldn't have existed before uh with like the older versions of the apple pencil now that haptic bump there's like a little motor on the inside so that you know certain times it gives you a little bit of a tactile feedback it's really subtle I think there's utility to it for
sure like for people that are using professional apps and you have a workflow and you want to just make sure that you performed an action or you you did something that taptic feedback is really nice but I don't think for the average person it does anything it is really neat though and the fact that they're able to stick that tiny motor inside that device really cool now that Barrel rolling orientation like the whole ability to just like adjust the the rotational configuration of the apple
pencil if I'm using that word right is so cool like it's really neat but I think in order to really appreciate it you have to be some kind of like digital illustrator or some artist because for me when I looked at him like this tool looks really neat if I knew how to draw but uh the tech is really cool I have seen that before on a few older devices but I remember on one of the Wacom tablets that had that Tech I remember the battery life being like horrifically short so it's neat that they're able to
pull this off again on like a rechargeable thing like that I it's it's cool I don't like that this new app pencil Pro doesn't work with the old iPad Pros now they saying that they they changed the charging mechanism on the inside be able to fit everything and because of that change you can no longer charge this new pencil with the old magnetic Chargers maybe I hope it's not some kind of like product segregation they're going for but it's it it still sucks regardless uh
the other thing the new keyboard so the ones that fit on the new iPad Pros the larger 13-in one in particular that one feels just like a regular laptop keyboard the metal finish and the metal trackpad it just feels like it just feels like you would expect like a MacBook to feel okay that basically wraps it up there's so much stuff but that'll have to come in the review because I feel like a lot of the thoughts I have I want to kind of test it out and give proper feedback on the
actual device okay hope you guys enjoyed this video just a quick uh first impression of these devices
