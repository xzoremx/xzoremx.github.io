Apple launched their new M3 MacBook airs there's a 13-in model and this here is their 15-in model but despite being what many would argue to be the best laptop in this segment there were a lot of concerns and complaints that kind of bubbled up right at the announcement like when I tweeted about it there were just people that were I think that had legitimate concerns about it but there's also stuff that seems a little bit misguided I kind of want to go through it so uh right off the rip this is the
M2 MacBook Air in a 13-inch model and this is the M3 and the surface anization on the new M3 versions at least in the darker colors so the midnight color and the space black are supposed to have this like seal to them like kind of coating over it to prevent fingerprints or to kind of reduce the presence of fingerprints and when I tested it on the space black model last year it seemed pretty noticeable but for whatever reason I'll just demonstrate real quick so this is the M21 when I smudge it
around my nose and my face which is disgusting but just to get the point across the grease appears right there kind of smudges appear if I do the same thing on the new one I would have imagined that it would be much more reduced but I feel like there's not much of a difference and I was surprised I mean look at me I'm like rubbing laptops on my face here but I was surprised at how present these smudges were uh and I don't know if I got a lemon or something but like when I try to clean it off it
seems just as smudgy so my impression is that it is slightly better than the nonsealed version version but it's not like a fingerprint proof material if that's what you're hoping for okay on to the actual meat of this video uh all right first I want to talk about what I think is the biggest change or update to the M3 product it's the ability for the M3 MacBook Air to be able to connect to two external displays now to be able to pull this off the lid has to be closed you cannot use the built-in laptop
screen it's just if you're connecting two screens it'll now work if you do want to use the built-in laptop screen you're back down to just One external display just like the M1 and M2 MacBook airs now when this feature was announced I think a lot of people were disappointed because they were like how is this announcement like there are so many Windows laptops out there that can run three or four screens concurrently and even the previous generation of MacBook airs like the Intel based ones
those could run two external screens with its internal laptop screen running like what GES what what's going on here well I think it's just the nature of these chips these M1 M2 M3 like the base model of those chips they've always only had one display controller that would handle the external displays it was just like one single controller that could handle a 6K output for externals now what I think they're doing now on the M3 MacBook Air I think they're just rerouting the internal 5K uh display
controller and just pumping it out there's no like malice or like bizarre trickery going on that's just the nature of the hardware you cannot have more than those two displays running at any given time and I see the complaints like there's that's that's just the way the hardware is now that being said I think that there's some kind of trickery that was going on back in the day as in when I think about what's happening here it doesn't make sense for Apple to just give out free features like this that's
just Apple's not in the business of doing that right I think what happened is that Apple felt pressured to do this from the Enterprise clients like for a lot of people I know several kind of high-end clients that purchase Apple hardware and they held back from Apple silicon they continued to use their intel-based MacBooks because those things could run two external screens no problem and I think Intel banked on Enterprise clients to be able to just pay a premium and buy into that Pro
lineup to get that extra screen external stuff and I don't think people wanted to spend that money and I think Apple felt pressured they're like you know what I think we have to do this if we're going to get a lot of Enterprise clients to switch over to Apple silicon I think that's the only thing that makes sense to me why else would they do this right this seems too good for Apple's nature to be true but I think it's a win I don't think it's perfect but having two external displays on an entry-level
MacBook Air is not bad but you do need to have peripherals now connected to that device uh the second point of contention is the starting configuration of 8 GB of RAM and 256 gigs of storage I hate it every time I see it like it bothers me now there's two issues at hand here first is the whole idea that the starting configuration is only 8 gigs of RAM but the second issue is the price of the upgrades now I'm going to address the 8 gigs of Base Ram first I don't think that that number is terrible
in the sense that there are a ton of people I would say the vast majority of people that even consider this machine that would be perfectly good with 8 gigs of RAM for like five six years and would never notice any difference in the workflow if they had 16 gigs of RAM I I firmly believe that I've done a lot of testing I've shown it to you guys I think there's a lot of like clickbait YouTube out there that tries to build the idea that you absolutely need 16 gigs of RAM but rage bait doesn't take
away from the reality of data if you're using it for regular use 8 gigs of RAM is plenty for the vast majority of people but the other issue at hand is the cost of the upgrades and it wouldn't be having this super sweaty conversation about RAM on a MacBook if it wasn't for the fact that they have crazy pricing for those upgrades like to go from 8 gigs of RAM to 16 is $200 I actually think it's like five times the industry price for like Ram upgrades at this point but because it's all baked on you
have to make that decision upfront now if you think about the math it's like literally 20% more money to go for an extra 8 gigs of RAM it's so stupid it it like eats my soul every time I look at that configuration pricing but I think there's a bit of a solution here I think for most people that are looking at that like the the price configurator and they're like wow that is a stupid amount of money and it is but usually you're like on a hard budget you're like I have
"1,00 bucks or like whatever 1,200 bucks" and that's my limit like I don't want to go more than that so like what do I do and the The Simple Solution this time is you don't get the M3 because they have great product the M2 that's 100 bucks cheaper and if you get it on referb or used it's even more you can get like 15 20% off just by going to the previous generation and if you want to save even more money the M1 MacBook airs are even cheaper which leads me to the conversation of that mild performance
gain over the years from M1 to M3 because that has been another complaint that we keep see popping up it's like wow these new Chips aren't that much better absolutely they aren't but that's kind of a good thing right in terms of pricing when they when they release this M3 product they have to reduce the price of the older one and if the gains aren't massive which they aren't just buy the old one I think in all my years of doing YouTube I don't think I've ever made a video where I was like don't buy the new
one buy the old one because that's normally like common sense right if you want the best value the previous generation is always going to be that case so I don't bother with that but and think in this particular timing of this time period because the M2 and m1's were so close in performance of the M3 and there's that much cheaper and apple has a refurb store which has like steeper discounts it just doesn't make sense to buy the M3 product if you're on a tight budget unless you need the double
external screen now the CPU gains since M1 have been limited the gains when it comes to graphics performance though is more noticeable it's just that it's quite dependent on the application that you're using now the battery life on the M3 MacBook a 15 was really similar to the M2 product from last year it's just that it seems to drain a little faster on heavier loads but I think in general when you look at Apple's website there's a reason why they're comparing a lot of this performance on the M3 MacBook Air
product to Intel products just because that's where you're going to notice the biggest gains now in terms of gaming this is a fanless system right keep that in mind but uh this can run some pretty demanding games at lower settings but in general you're going to want to be playing some really light titles now the last I want to talk about real briefly is the mentioning of AI in Apple's marketing material so they talked about running llms and diffusion models on the M3 MacBook Air and it's legit even
though they don't use nvidia's Cuda Apple silicon is fairly effective at handling that type of workflow uh now just to wrap this off the internals of this device haven't changed right like nothing or when I say internals I mean like the screen and the keyboard this is still a class leading keyboard uh the speakers are't changed these sound really good especially for a device that's super thin like this um the screen it goes up to 500 nits this is a solid screen I mean obviously the
exposure of the camera is kind of portraying A Brighter Image than it actually gets up to it is capped at 60 HZ if that matters to you it is like the thing that I believe Apple uses just kind of separate the pro products from the amateur products uh that refresh rate okay there you have it the M3 MacBook Air
