this laptop has incredible battery life it's an Intel chip but it lasts longer than a Macbook it lasts longer than an arm-based laptop is literally has the longest battery life I've ever tested on a laptop even compared against the current battery Kings now the chip that's in here is Intel's new lunar Lake chip it's an awesome new chip but this device has been tuned specifically by Lenovo and Intel to deliver something next level so this is the new yoga slim 7i AA Edition now the aura Edition is a
new product category from Lenovo that's like the highest tier product that they offer they've just spent a little more engineering time on the hardware the software and the customer support to deliver something that's just a little more special so this device is a super light 15in device it's lighter than a MacBook Air it's not as thin as the MacBooks but you do get more ports you get uh a usba a on the right side and you also get on the left side one HDMI as well as the two Thunderbolt 4 ports
and an audio jack now the screen uses one of their pight Pro panels this one's running a 15-in LCD I believe there are olet options available but even this base screen looks awesome it's 120 HZ very color accurate it's got pretty much Perfect Color gamut out of the box and everything looks good on it if you're working with media files playing games or just watching shows everything looks good on the screen now the star of the show with this product is the chip and it's running the new Intel Core Ultra 7
258 V now at the time of shooting this and this is also an engineering sample so keep that in mind but the time of shooting this I don't know how much of this chip I'm supposed to be talking about because it hasn't been publicly announced yet but these are the first-party benchmarks that Intel has shown their emphasis is on single core performance now I'm not supposed to Benchmark this unit but I can comfortably say that their numbers are in fact legit but when you take a look
at the Energy Efficiency of this chip particularly on this device with that aura Edition tuning it's pretty nuts this device uses around half the energy compared to an Intel device from not even 2 years ago and then the graphics that's in here is also very interesting so this is now running the new Intel Ark 140v and their first party benchmarks look very impressive my testing on this unit despite it being a weaker chip lines up very closely but the one thing that's super impressive is the Energy
Efficiency of the system like the total system package runs so CPU GPU and the system Ram all of it 30 WTS or less like that just does not make sense for an in system to get that kind of performance with this little heat and this little fan noise is crazy so the fan noise right when I set this thing up like when I get a new laptop in and I'm installing everything I'm putting all the new games on all the benchmarking stuff all the creative software that stuff turns on the fan but this system was so quiet it
didn't even feel like a Windows laptop certainly not an Intel Windows laptop because it's just never been the way it was even the meteor Lake chip from a year ago even though that was a big jump up from the previous generation this is is just a whole another level it's so quiet now if you take a look at the inside you see you're two pretty big but quiet fans but if you look at this PCB it's interesting in the sense that it looks denser than normal like there's just more components on it than your
average laptop PCB and it's because this is a single-sided PCB they've stuck all of the components on the side that we're looking at on the back side of this thing it's supposedly empty and it's because it allows all the thermal components or all the thermally generating components to be on this side so that if they're trying to cool it it's just a more optimized thermal design but because it's a single-sided PCB you don't have as much real estate to work with you now have to use a short
nvme drive instead of like the full length but it is replaceable the Wi-Fi 7 card though is baked on you can't swap that out and you also have a 70w hour battery as well as your four speakers and these sound good at this point I think lenovo's figured out how to do the audio properly on their devices took them like 10 years but they're finally there uh okay the keyboard it's 1.5 mm travel and just out of the box I typing super fast on it I think Lenovo makes some of the best keyboards in this
laptop space the thing that's interesting or new about this one is that there's a texture to the surface like each key has this it's like a silky soft touch finish it's not rubbery it's this Ultra smooth almost like an etched surface texture to it I really like it now out of the box it looks and feels wonderful but I do wonder how this will age because there is a texture on this key now and you know how old key caps kind of wear down and they get shiny and maybe it'll wear poorly but we'll have
to see in like five or six years now the battery life on this device is the extra special part so like I said longest lasting device I've ever tested I actually have to rerun some of these just to be sure but the Netflix watch time on this thing is incredible it does use an IPS panel but the Energy Efficiency is even better than the new Snapdragon chip now part of that Energy Efficiency comes from Intel's lunar Lake chip itself another part of it though comes from lenovo's AI Core they have a
chip in here that's designed to adjust the power usage depending on what you're doing automatically so if you're in Netflix or taking a web call or something it'll tweak your power draw now the AA Edition laptops also get a few software features that are unique to them so the first you get smart modes you can control your power settings with just one tap there's other tools in there to help with battery life but those are more complicated to use now the other feature that comes with aura
Edition devices is a neat thing called Smart Share so all it takes is just you can use any phone for this you can tap the side of your device and you can send photos from your iPhone or Android whatever you have to your laptop it uses Intel Unison and it allows you to share files and photos from your phone directly to your device it's pretty cool uh the other thing that or Edition devices get is customer support so you can do video calls with their texts and Engineers you can even get next day
on-site service to swap out parts or whatnot um now there's a few things I dislike about this product and just I would say the aura additions so far the first is remember keep in mind the aura Edition branding is around like a premium experience right out of the box this thing had maffi installed now I think in 2024 no one needs maffi the antivirus software I think that thing is awful but to see that piece of software exist on a premium product like this I think I really think that thing should
be removed the other thing number two is I think the design of this product is it's so it's not special like if this is supposed to be your super product Ultra Premium it should look and feel like that right this should have a different design language this should have like I don't know I don't design laptops I'm not taking it should have like erasing stripes and stuff but it should have a different aesthetic that immediately looks and feels like a premium product out of the gate and this looks like just
every other Lenovo Yoga product it's a nice design but it's just it's the same uh the third thing is also this hinge so it is not a one-hand openable hinge now I don't think this is like the end all and be all of product you know product Hardware but I think perfectly designed Hardware should should be part of a really high-end experience and this is you need either to Jiggle It open or you need to two-hand it and I bring this up because Lenovo has multiple products that are oneand openable with a very
similar hinge design why is this one not like this maybe it's the engineering sample I don't know but from what I've seen is actually meant to be like this like a stiff hinge maybe that's something that they can fix before launch I don't know uh but there you have it this is the Lenovo Yoga slim 7i Aura Edition I think there's a lot of cool stuff that comes with it particularly that like the hardware tuning that's actually very unique in the laptop space okay hope you guys enjoyed this video
