so about a month ago I was at of Starbucks picking up a coffee and on my way out I saw for the first time in my life someone with a dual screen laptop like actually using it and I was like oh my God this is so cool he actually has one he's actually going to use it so I was going to leave and I was like I can't leave I need to see how this whole thing plays out so I got a table near him and I saw him set it up and I was like pretending to use my phone but I was just creeping on the whole process
and it looked like he was looking at some like x-rays on the top screen and then some like other app on the bottom screen and eventually built up the curve just be like I need to know right I so I went up to him like tell me about this whole thing and he had no idea who I was he was just so excited and so enthusiastic to share this whole dual screen laptop experience with me he went through the whole thing and I didn't have the heart to be like yeah I know all this stuff because I reviewed it but
it was really neat to see from the perspective of a user all the neat things that he loved about it but then at the end I was like that's cool and all but what is it that you don't like about it like what are the things that you dislike about this product and the whole experience and he highlighted three things a couple of them I actually talked about in my first video so number one he didn't like that you couldn't use that product it was the yoga book by the way the two screen yoga book you
couldn't use it on your lap like he wanted to do the stuff in his car but the whole experience on that device without a table is not great so he would go into coffee shops and set everything up so he could do the stuff every morning the second thing though was that he thought that the performance like so he was showing me the x-rays like he was looking at like the alignment of teeth he was an orthodontist and the models when you spun them around would stutter a lot because the integrated GPU on the
thing wasn't great but the other thing was that the product he felt like didn't interact like a normal laptop he had to carry it a certain way he had to put it in like bags a certain way he just wished it was shaped and looked like a normal laptop and the whole time that he went through this and I thanked him for his time I had this device I had this product and I was like I wish I could show him this thing I couldn't because it was under NDA but I it was in my backpack in the car but I was like I
could have shown him this thing that day and I wish I did I wish I'd broken the dam NDA because he would have freaking loved this thing now this product is the new Asus Zenbook Duo and I think this thing is so cool I think that in the future most laptops will be like this I really think that because there's so much utility that comes with this so when you pop this thing open it looks like a regular laptop right like a regular single screen laptop it's got a fullsize keyboard full-size trackpad
glass trackpad and it's just like a it works like you would right looks like you would expect and it's not super thick right maybe not an ultra thin laptop but when you pop it open you discover that this thing has a second screen now before I interact with this secondary screen I want to talk about what I think defines this product it's actually this keyboard so this keyboard uh it's a Bluetooth keyboard and if you use it as a regular kind of Wireless experience it's a normal keyboard or
normal wireless keyboard it's got a good amount of travel it's got a perfectly uh responsive touchpad but when you put it onto the bottom screen or the bottom area this thing attaches with Pogo pins so there's a bunch of connectors on the bottom here and then these interact with these little pins down here and it's a magnetic system you kind of put it near it it just snaps into place and then it becomes a wired keyboard experience there's no lag or latency on this intera
on this keyboard it's like it's it's so good now because there's magnets on the bottom of this thing and the bottom screen here you can be very sloppy and I'll just slide in place it's surprisingly good at just finding its correct position and just connecting that one didn't go but you got to give it a little bit of a little push and it's good to go now you'll notice the screen is stuttering here and there and it's because as you remove the keyboard it's switching from a dual screen
product to a single screen product and the drivers need to obviously interact act with that but the other thing that makes this product really neat actually you got to see the hinge now because this hinge has multiple positions I think it go from like 40° to 60° you have a ridiculous amount of customizability with how you want to position everything now the bottom of this product you can see the hinge this is a extraordinarily tanky hinge it's all like it's metal it's like it's so
solid and it's built right into the bottom of this device uh I imagine that if you ever like cranked this thing and you broke it because it's got screw points here you could just replace the hinge if you ever needed to but just from the it's just so solid and because it's got these angles on it these bevels on it you can use it as two vertical screens and they'll auto rotate like if you're like a developer oh my God having two screens like this is so sick now the thing
that okay let's just start off from the top of why I love this this product is not super expensive I mean the average kind of productivity focused device I would say in the market if you want a "good one is about 1,000 to maybe 1,200" bucks for something that's built like this I think that's pretty fair right but this product is $4.99 it comes with a backpack and a sleeve for the laptop as well as a pen for the device because it uses touchscreen so you can draw or paint on
the screen if you're an artist or a digital illustrator and because it's got a high refresh screen there's very low latency between the pen input and what you're actually seeing on the display and obviously it has like you know pen input so you can use it for handwriting right so it's got a lot of Versatility like that I think that for a product that is priced at $4.99 it's kind of weird to have this kind of versatility it's it's so cool now when I said earlier that I think in the future more
products will be like this it stems from the fact that this experience of using the kind of regular laptop mode of single screen with a keyboard and trackpad this is uncompromised on this product like it it legitimately feels like a normal laptop and you obviously have that wonderful experience of the dual screen now the double screen experience I'm just going to talk about this uh from a personal perspective when I pulled this thing out of the box I was at home so I set it up on my bed and
this is a Vibe like to have the kickstand so you can just like comfortably and confidently set it up somewhere on your bed and just have your keyboard remotely and just be able to access like shows and be able to have something else on the bottom screen this is such an amazing experience and because you cannot replicate this kind of two two screen experience without a ton of other products and a ton of gear I think that this like anyone who us uses this if you try this you just you
fall in love with it you fall in love with the user experience of having two screens or just the option of having two screens without a compromised single screen experience like that is something that you just could not get with any other product before and this can do it it's so cool now in terms of the actual performance I was told specifically not to Benchmark this laptop because it's too early on in the product cycle none of the drivers are tuned yet right but I will say that because this is running
Intel's core Ultra chips these have way better GPU performance and really solid CPU performance for the wattage than anything they've had before this is a very smooth experience in OverWatch can't tell you the exact frame rate but you can imagine I mean look at the screen right it's very smooth all right let's talk about the screens so there's two screen configurations choose from this one here is a 3K OLED panel so 2880 by 1800 on both the top panel and the bottom panel and it's got 100% dcip 3 up
to 500 nits and the OLED is just really nice to look at but there's another cheaper version of this product that has a 1920x 1200 screen so it's like just low resolution but it still has 500 nits and still has uh the 100% DC3 so I think on a product like that because these are 14-inch screens right for someone that's seen a lot of 14-in laptops I feel like most people should opt for that lower resolution screen the biggest thing is that you're driving two screens here right so there's just more pressure on
the GPU to to pump out so many pixels when you have the higher resol ution screen it is available as an option for people that are you know if they're working with you know detailed photos and video and you need that resolution go for it but if you are interested in this product I would push more people to that lower resolution screen because of the dual screen nature also Asus has a bunch of tools that they've built specifically for a double screen device like this so the one thing I thought was
neat was you can adjust the brightness of the screens independently so this is like super useful you can have like a really bright top screen and really dark bottom screen or vice versa and oh man if it goes completely dark are you blind you are wait wa wait wait wait wait wait wait can you adjust yeah yeah yeah you can use the keyboard still thank God okay but you can adjust it uh to your heart's content and it's just like if you have apps that have like different brightness that you would want but also
when you have screens that are on an angle you just often because of the way light transmission works you often want them on different brightness if you can um but the other thing that I thought was neat is they have a tool that allows you to mirror the screen so that let's say you and I are at a table and I was on a regular laptop in order for me to show what's on my screen I have to kind of put it in the middle so we can both see it but on a double screen you can mirror your screen and it's inverted for
the other person so you could be on that side looking at the same thing that I'm doing and as I interact on my screen is just mirrored in the proper orientation on your side so if you're like in a meeting or something it's kind of neat um there's just small tools that they've added to this device that I think just make it extra useful now obviously if you ever want to connect up the keyboard to this device you would just place it on and then now it switches over to single screen laptop mode but if you are
for whatever reason in a pinch and you don't have access to that uh Bluetooth keyboard you have the ability to turn on a if you just give me a second a onscreen keyboard that's actually quite similar to the one that was on the uh uh Lenovo Yoga I don't love typing on these things but you can like it's it's usable if you want to just see what this is like it's not great but this is just the nature of any kind of onscreen keyboard compared to an actual physical keyboard uh now another thing that thought was
interesting they've designed it so that if you ever have a circumstance where I'm just going to like show you the side of the product to be able to kind of see what's going on here so if you're in a situation where you don't have the keyboard stuck into the device there is a gap right because that's just the nature of having the keyboard missing but they've put these like rubber strips there so that if the screen does get squashed it doesn't just slam into the panel there's like a you can't you can
only squash it so far before it hits the Rubber and then like it won't break the device I'm assuming with enough pressure you'll bust it but under normal use it won't break uh but once you have the keyboard installed or placed on now it's like a normal device so in terms of the ports there's one US Bea and then two USBC there is a third USBC down here but this is not connected to the system this is just to charge the wireless keyboard so if you ever need tuna pinch separate
from the device itself you can and there's also HDMI and uh audio jack but I think on a device like this I'm not expecting any more ports I feel like this has a good selection of ports considering all the things that are going on and in terms of The Thermals and the fan noise again I I wasn't allowed to Benchmark this thing but I will say that my initial impressions are that they're more than sufficient the chips are more energy efficient ient and they have a pretty decent thermal system
going on there you heard this thing when I was playing OverWatch right that's as loud as it gets so I'm happy with it uh now earlier I said that I feel like a device like this is the future of computing and I really feel like that because if you have like anyone who had the option of like hey do you want to take the device that you have right now make it let's say 3 mm thicker and then give it a secondary screen wouldn't you want that and without jacking up the price too much for this kind of money
$14.99 you get this type of performance you get the two OLED screens like it's just it's really solid I'm surprised actually that they priced it like this to be completely honest but there you have it this is the Zenbook Duo and yeah I think this is It's A vibe man this thing is so cool so cool all  right
