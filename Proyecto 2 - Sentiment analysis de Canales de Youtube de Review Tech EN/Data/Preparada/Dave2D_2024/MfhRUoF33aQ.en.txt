lenovo's Legion laptops are some of the best performing devices in their class and they're very popular for good reason uh so they have a bunch of new ones Lenovo and Intel wanted to sponsor this video so you guys can get an early look at these two this is the legion 7i this is the legion Pro 7i and they're marketed a little bit differently this year so this product here the pro 7i still where you're going to get the most powerful hardware for the best performance for competitive Gamers but
this product the regular Legion 7 is a little bit different this year this replaces the slim monoc kurd product uh it's just uh it's kind of like a hybrid product where it's built to be really good for enthusiast Gamers but also still has the styling and weight characteristics of like a more normal laptop it's not like super gamery it's thinner and lighter than the pro product but let's dive in so this device is where I'm going to start the new regular Legion 7 this device is well first of
all it's color they've had white laptops in the legion product line before but they were never available in North America I think they were like region specific this is the first time I've seen a white laptop from the Lenova Legion line it looks awesome like this is It's So Clean like it's just pure white the keys are white the bottom panel is also white like everything is just super white even the rubber strips on the bottom these things might get slain if you're using it on like really
dirty materials but very white laptop and I love the look of it it's an all design where they focus on keeping the device thin and light but they also increase the system wattage and the overall performance which is really difficult to do the way you would do it though is by tackling the thermal system so this here is the predecessor of that product this is last year's Legion slim 7 and if you look at the thermal system here cold air gets sucked in and then it gets exhausted out the sides and the
back this is very kind of standard thermal design on a lot of laptops but the thermal system on the legion 7 is a little bit different so if you look at the back panel here you'll notice a bunch of vents but when you open this up and you look at it you'll realize that half of these vents are covered up maybe even more than half and there's also there's foam outline here and there's also foam elements here and the purpose of this kind of covering and these foam pieces is that they're creating a middle
section here that they call the hyper chamber it's a sealed off section so that the air flow is driven in a very particular way so the air will come in through the the fans here just being sucked in and then there's obviously some that blows out the back here but there's a huge chunk of air that's blown across the middle into the sealed section and then it goes out the back so if you'll notice this whole device has no side ventilation but all of the ports or all the exhausts are on the back like
basically the entire back segment is an exhaust and the difference it makes is surprisingly significant they've been able to increase wattage and performance while having measurably lower temperatures and quieter fans all in the same kind of form factor and weight class as before it's really well done now granted this is a early kind of pre retail version of this so I'm imagine there's like more tuning involved but first impressions pretty good uh now the legion Pro 7i still has the same thermal
design as the previous generation that uses a vapor chamber which is a little bit beefier but very effective now both of these devices are running Intel's new 14th gen core processors which for my testing on these early there's only a slight bump up in performance compared to the 13th gen but if you want the highest possible C performance these are the chips to do it and because they are overclockable in lenovo's software you can let them rip at full blast there's a lot of control in that software uh but
there's also a new chip from Intel out right now called the meteor Lake core Ultra chips and those are very cool they're very energy efficient but they don't have the same kind of top-end performance as these devices if you want like just the best possible CPU performance these are still the Kings and so if you're looking at at these products and you're like you're trying to decide between the two if you're just playing like mid-tier gaming uh or if you're kind of like kind of medium
content creation you don't really need the fastest CPU that stuff is great but if you want like literally the best possible performance you can get in laptops you do have to get one of these chips though they're a little more power hungry but they get the job done the Pro Models can be configured with up to an RTX 4090 the regular models can go up to an RTX 470 now when it comes to battery life both of these devices are very good for their product class because they both have very big batteries the biggest
battery you can get but these are gaming laptops with performance Focus chips they're not going to have the longest battery life they are however very good for achieving the highest possible performance in games and also if you're a student or recent grad and you want a device that's you know reasonably portable but has excellent performance for like 3D work or engineering stuff or math stuff like something like this it would fit the ticket portable yet really high performance okay these laptops also
run lenovo's new AI chips the slim models running the new newest version of it the la3 and these chips have scenario detection and other tools to boost the performance of the device when it's underload now a quick note about the keyboard This is a Lenovo Legion keyboard and as You' expect it's awesome and I think it's because Lenovo owns ThinkPad and all the IP around the ThinkPad keyboards just trickled down to this device so uh very easy to type on very fast and responsive now the
shortcut game is always it always surprises me that these are the only guys that do this when you press function all the short cutable Keys light up right so I can switch between the different keyboard profiles I can get some flashy RGB I can change the brightness of the RGB but also you can change between the fan profiles with just a shortcut I've always love that even the screen refresh rate if you want to go from like 60 to 240 htz and then back is just a shortcut you don't have
to mess around in Windows settings and stuff it's really nice uh the screen awesome screens both these devices use pure sight gaming displays that have options to go up to 240 HZ with great color gamut and brightness they're awesome for playing games and watching shows uh the port selection between the two devices a little bit different the pro model has an Ethernet Jack the regular model doesn't but it does have an SD card slot and obviously there's a few differences in the usba and USBC
configurations but they're both kind of aimed at the appropriate audience I would say uh but there you have it the new Legion 7i and Legion Pro 7i
