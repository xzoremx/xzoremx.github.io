my initial impressions of the new pixel9 devices was not great like based off of that launch event I thought that the hardware had very minimal updates and then the AI software that they were headlining with just seemed not particularly impressive so I was like maybe they're not even send me review units this year but they showed up uh and these phones are way better than I thought they would be but for reasons that I just did not expect so let's start off with the hardware so the new
shape it's like a very flat FL back very flat front and I like it I thought I wouldn't like enjoy the new shape and Camera hump design as much but after just a week of using it I totally dig this new look uh the other thing the screens so brighter screens and perfectly flat screens with even bezels that go around the whole device I wouldn't say that the increased brightness this year is that noticeable in indoor environments but when you're outdoors and the sun's just going full
blast you do notice the brighter screen on the pixel nine devices the new fingerprint sensors are ultrasonic so they don't shine light in the dark to unlock but it doesn't seem any faster than the previous generation it does seem a little bit more reliable especially if your fingers are wet but speed it's pretty much the same the haptics and the speakers are pretty much the same from this generation in the last but the chip is where I noticed the first kind of surprising difference so
based off of Just performance benchmarks the new chip is barely faster uh and it also in classic pixel fashion does Throttle Down pretty quickly when you're playing heavy games games at maximum Graphics but the battery life was very impressive on both the devices particularly though on the pixel9 pro XL this is a very longlasting device this year all right I want to move this conversation over to the more interesting and more important conversation of software and right now
the big thing with phone software is AI the use and integration of AI to improve the software experience or at least that's what the companies would try uh to have us believe okay when it comes to the pixel devices I would attribute the software or the AI experience into kind of two pillars first is the system software and how AI affects that particularly with Google Gemini and then the second thing is camera software and how Google has all these AI tools to improve that experience we're going to
talk about both let's start off with the first thing the system software so you would expect like if you're going to sell a phone if you're going to sell a brand new pixel 9 or pixel9 Pro phone you would expect the Gemini experience to be special like if they're going to pitch that like if you look all the press material and all the kind of launch conversation it was about Gemini this Gemini that and so I just assumed that there would be so many exclusive features that lean on Gemini on this
phone and there aren't there are three uh so the first one I'll demo real I'm just going to show you all these things so the first one is the ability to summarize a YouTube video using Gemini so let's say I'm watching blond haired lonus right now and instead of uh instead of watching a full 23 minute video let's say I want to just get a brief summary of it I would launch Gemini and I would tap this button here and I'd say hey tell me a brief summary actually it's not even
listening giv me a brief summary of this  sentences and it'll take a minute not a minute like 10 seconds and hopefully give me a summary now this video is uh it can dictate it to you but there's a there's a summary and this is a very cool feature I feel like there's a lot of kind of long form content that people kind of just want to get a just get the the koh's notes of it right I just want the the quick dirty version of it and this is a very powerful tool that's built right into the pixel phones that I
think is exclusive to the pixel 9 devices right now that that's neat that's the first one that's the first kind of pixel9 exclusive the second thing that the pixel 99's do is they have the pixel studio so this is an AI image generation app or tool and this is really good in the sense that I've played with so many of these and this is actually what I think to be the easiest one to use as well as reasonably powerful but very fast like strangely fast so let's say I wanted to okay let's go
for a panda that's climbing a tree that has a bunch of rainbow axotal on that tree and make this tree a coniferous tree not a deciduous one and it's just seconds there it is is a coniferous tree with a panda climbing it and there's rainbow colored axelos over it now you can generate more of them it's fairly quick and this is all real time I'm not like speeding it up or anything and the thing that I found most interesting about this app is that it's remarkably easy to use my 5-year-old
daughter had this for like hours and just generating all these pictures and giggling and laughing and it's neat from the perspective of like novelty because if I'm being honest like and these are cool right these are like these are well drawn but it's a novel I don't want to use the word gimmick because it's that's got like a very negative connotation to it but the novelty of this whole thing wears off quickly I didn't this Bulbasaur this guy's awesome look at this right a
Bulbasaur this is from my kid Bulbasaur running across the water and he's being attacked or chased by a bunch of small bees perfect and you can get more of them so right now I think there's like it's somehow producing copyright material but who cares it works what it can't do right now is generate uh humans like so if I wanted to create a human like U I don't know draw me a person doing this it won't because that's not uh it's not part of the usage experience right now maybe it comes in the future
but this being the second kind of exclusive feature on the pixel 9 devices is neat but the thing you have to keep in mind is that it's such a novel toy and the thing that I kind of want to draw or kind of keep in your mind is that if you're looking at this feature and you're like wow that's cool I could use that that would be fun absolutely it's fun but there's a ton of apps out there that do something very similar to this maybe not as simple to use uh and I don't think it should be a thing that
makes you like go in on this device the other thing is that I wouldn't be surprised if this whole experience becomes slower as more and more people use it like right now very few people have pixel 99's and very few people are using pixel studio so maybe that servers have like a ton of bandwidth and a ton of processing capability to pump these things out super quick it it seems strangely fast this just a thought uh but that's that's it that's pixel Studio lot of fun but how much utility does it have
really uh now the third thing that is an exclusive to the pixel9 devices when it comes to kind of system software is screenshots now this was demoed during the launch event and it's got utility but there are a couple things that you should be aware of so first you know what is a screenshots app so basically it allows you to search through your potentially massive collection of screenshots for a specific or particular thing that you're looking for so as you take screenshots the app will process
those screenshots and tag them with identifier so you'll be able to search through them or for them within the app now it does take a bit of time so if you just took a screenshot and you know 2 seconds later trying to search it it doesn't show up it does need some processing time and you can kind of force it to process certain images but it does have utility one thing I did notice uh well you know what I'll just demo it real quickly so uh this is the screenshots app can you show me some screenshots I 
Nike and these are some of the shoes that I kind of was interested in over the past little bit and then uh yeah you can just find stuff and so another one you could search is like just a demo can you show me some white watches  at uh now sometimes you'll get kind of hallucinations like this is clearly not a white watch but because the white background maybe it tagged it with that color um but yeah now there's a couple things to note here first there will be times when you take a screenshot that
has langu anguage in that screenshot that is not supported by this app right now so this one is an example of this so this is a screenshot I took from just a Google Search and it's a pair of shoes I like the color uh there's English at the bottom here I'll zoom in real quick you know you can see the Nike Dunk uh it's the April color wave that I think looks really nice but because of the Japanese language on here it decided that this was an image that it couldn't process so
once you take the shot it kind of shows you right at the bottom that it couldn't process the screenshot due to an unsupported language despite the fact that there's English in that screenshot so it's just a little minor thing to keep in mind at least right now I'm sure over time that'll improve but the second thing and I think this is a more egregious problem with this whole screenshots app is that you need to be within the app itself to do the searching like if you're out on your
home screen and you launch the regular Gemini app can you show me some screenshots that I  Dunks it won't work it rather show you like Google image screenshots sorry I can't help with that you can take a screenshot directly using your device or it'll give you that message and you it just basically tells you you have to be within the screenshots app itself in order to search for it which is it makes sense but it's not particularly convenient uh but those are the three kind of exclusive features that I've
found at least on the pixel 9 devices so the first being YouTube summarization second being the pixel um pixel studio and then the third thing being the screenshots app now there is another kind of like it's not an exclusive but there is a value added feature that comes with the pixel 9 devices sorry the pixel 9 Pro devices so pixel9 pro pixel9 pro XL and then the fold so those three devices get a one-year subscription to Gemini Advanced now it's a $20 a month normally so a
one-year subscription would be worth 240 bucks but that kind of value ad is I mean the question is what does Gemini Advanced even do so there's a there's a few things let's let's break it down to three kind of big things the first one is you get two tbytes of cloud storage from Google so you can upload all your photos and videos and large files to Google's Cloud the second thing you get is the ability for Google's Gemini to ingest and analyze or process large amount of like Text data so let's say
you have a ton of documents and you want you know Google Gemini to summarize all this stuff or analyze it for whatever reason you can upload massive amounts to it you got a lot of tokens to do it that's one of the benefits of uh Gemini advance but the third and most interesting thing about Gemini Advance is access to Gemini live and Gemini live is Google's most advanced like chatbot that's all it really is just the a chat bot like chat gbt but but theirs is in at least in Google's mind Gemini live is
the most advanced version of what they have and the thing that's most interesting about it is that you can interrupt it so I'll just demo it real quickly so this is the regular Gemini app but because I got that onee subscription it's now Gemini Advanced and I launch the live app and now we're in live and it's listening to me are you listening so I'm not quite sure what you mean by alive and listening maybe you could rephrase that let's start over because I was midp speech I am looking for a anniversary
gift for my wife this is going to be our  suggestions that's a great question the 12th anniversary is known as the silk or linen anniversary Trad I lied it's not the 12th anniversary it's actually our 13th  anniversary the traditional gift for a 13th anniversary is lace it's supposed to be delicate and so sorry I'm just getting interrup to you real quick I get it lace uh wife isn't really into let's say I'm looking for uh some kind of Toronto based itinerary so we could kind
of do things together on our anniversary with our two kids I have a a 10 year-old boy and a 5-year-old daughter we would like to do thing something as a whole family in the Toronto area where we could kind of like keep the itinerary relatively close and walking distance to each other could you kind of plan  us I can definitely help you with that Toronto has a ton of great family-friendly spots especially if you want to stay close together so for your anniversary you could start the day off
with a trip to the Toronto Zoo they've got a brand so it's a very natural speech experience uh and then you get the transcript when you're done with it I don't think it's particularly unique like I think the chat GPT experience is similar to this uh obviously this does have access to like Google Maps and you can do a little bit more with it because of the integration with all of Google stuff but that I mean those three things are really the the Crux of Gemini Advance with Gemini live being the star
of the show the overall problem that sticks out to me though is that the user needs to decide which AI assist they're going to use and then launch the appropriate one all three of these things are three separate AI experiences that need their own app and or launcher and or like activation process to activate and then they don't interact with each other as in the the experience and the conversation that I have in screenshots looking for a particular screenshot does not you know it's all it's three
different experiences that are very powerful but just have very little like Synergy it's so Google it's very on brand for them but I find the experience just not great now the second pillar of AI when it comes to pixels phones is their camera software and the AI tools that Google has or Google has put into their camera software has always been really cool but this year it's extra special and I didn't realize this based off their launch announcement so the main one that they demoed was their add
me in feature and if you'll remember it's the AI feature that allows you to take a picture and then hand off the camera to a second person and then now you can go in for that group shot the camera Tech works well but when I was asking my family and friends to try it there's definitely a learning curve to it it's not something that's super easy to use and also it can be kind of bothersome to get people to do a second photo so I don't know if I'd use it very often but it is neat in the sense of how
it works or how well it works some other interesting AI features are the two new video boost features so the first one is the new super res Zoom it's an incredibly powerful 20x Zoom so the way you do it is you just capture some video with the video boost enabled and you just punch into that 20x and then that file gets sent out to the Google servers it gets processed and it gets sent back a little while later when you look at how punched in that is and how far away those things are it's like it's quite
impressive you also get access to 8K video now again it's video that is sent to the Google servers upscaled and then sent back and those files are huge huge I think like 30 seconds of footage was almost a gig uh there's also the new magic editor that allows you to kind of remove objects and replace it with your own creation it is a very bizarre approach to photography I feel like there's some use for it I personally don't think I would ever use it but it's available the other thing that the magic
editor can do is reframe pictures so you may have a shot that didn't look particularly great like this is a good example if you run the autof frame on it it will recompose the shot with a generative fill so now added some extra Street and buildings and this new shot the composition of it is way better than the original photo but if you zoom in you can see that there's just a whole bunch of AI goop instead of actual real imagery but it is kind of neat if you have the right shot for it and the last
AI tool I want to talk about is the zoom enhancement this was something that was announced a long time ago and it's finally here in beta and it allows you to take a regular photo Zoom in and then use AI to generate detail and so this shot here is a pretty hard one the car in this shot is really small and there's not a lot of pixels or details to work with when it's zoomed in like this but it's using AI to generate extra pixels to give it higher resolution and it's just taking what it its best guess is as
to what those rims might look like and it's okay the zoom enhanced image does have more pixels and resolution but it's not exactly accurate I found that the zoom enhancement feature kind of works best with buildings like simple buildings where you can just have these repeated patterns or kind of textures that the AI can generate easily so that's some of the stuff that Google has put into the camera software but in terms of the camera Hardware itself there's a few things I want to talk
about the first is the zoom the telephoto on the pixel 9 Pro is way better this year than the previous generation I'm not sure if this is from the new sensor or some software trick but it's very good video stabilization though still isn't great the up and down movement is not bad but the moment you move left and right and there's any kind of like panned movement there's just weird artifacting within the videos there just a classic pixel video quality I'm surprised that in 2024 this is still
the case I obviously there's this is not an easy thing for them to solve but it just so many other brands have solved this issue at this point uh the front-facing camera so it's now a way higher resolution sensor it's now 42 megapixels instead of the 11 megapixel of the previous generation in terms of image quality though it's it's not a big jump like if you just kind of stare at them at regular distances without zooming in they actually look quite similar the new one though is wider so
if you want to do like kind of selfies with a bigger group the pixel 9 devices have a wider sensor now in terms of pricing this year's devices are $100 more than the previous generation and those devices were $100 more expensive than the year before that so it's been two years of price bumps now when it comes to Google's pixel devices because they go on sale so aggressively it's kind of hard hard to to kind of take the pricing at face value the MSRP is so elevated that it's these aren't real
prices what you see right now because it's going to be like two2 three $400 cheaper typically like wait a couple months and it'll be there but I would say that the AI features like the kind of the system software features like the Gemini and stuff I don't feel like it's worth it all of that stuff feels very easily brought onto older generations of phones if they wanted to I don't know how much they're going to artif officially gate that stuff but I feel like all three of those features will be
on older generation phones not too far away from now but the camera features really surprised me and because the camera Hardware wasn't massively different from the previous generation I wasn't expecting as big of a jump as we are seeing but you can see it across the board a lot of the AI tools that Google has applied to the whole camera experience are actually really powerful arguably more powerful than any other smartphone brand right now uh okay there you have it the new pixel9 devices
