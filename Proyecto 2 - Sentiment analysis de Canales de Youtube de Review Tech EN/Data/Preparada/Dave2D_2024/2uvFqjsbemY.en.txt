today is a big day in the laptop world because a bunch of devices were launched with the new Snapdragon X chip this is supposedly a very powerful chip with awesome Energy Efficiency so like incredible battery life and these are supposed to be cheaper chips so it' be able to put this type of chip into a laptop makes that whole product come down in price okay I was able to spend a little bit of time with a few of them and these are some First Impressions I'm going to start off with some surface
devices so with the Surface Pro 11 and the surface laptop 7 with the laptops having the biggest changes the screens on both devices are now OLED panels so the 13.5 in IPS panel for the previous generation has now been updated to a 13.8 in OLED panel and the 15-in panel as well but they both have much better contrast ratios and viewing angles just better image quality they would get with OLED Tech and you get thinner bezels but you also get for the first time that I can think of on a Surface laptop rounded
corners on the display now Apple's been doing this on their MacBooks for like over a decade at this point but they only do the top corners like the top left top right this on the surface laptop here we're seeing it on all four corners including the bottom ones and it's just I don't know I like the look I don't think it's for everyone but I think it's just like a nice design language that I think goes really well with the overall design of the surface devices uh the keyboard hasn't really
changed other than the inclusion of their co-pilot key which is like their AI button you press that and it'll do wonderful AI things that whole conversation of co-pilot and the new co-pilot plus that's a whole separate convers ation that'll come in the future the trackpads on the surface laptops have also been updated they're now a haptic touchpad in the sense that they're no longer like a physical can lever mechanism that goes up and down it is now a motor on the inside that
simulates the sensation of tapping on that touch pad and both the 13.8 and 15-in devices have this change another thing the new Surface laptop seemed a little chunkier than before so like the base of the device has a beefier middle segment which I actually like to see because usually that means better thermals and I imagine they went with this kind of chunkier design because they wanted to be to support the highest tier of Snapdragon X chips like the Snapdragon X Elite that has a slightly
higher wattage and they want to be able to run that chip on these new Surface devices but the interesting thing to me is that for years now the surface laptops when it came to the Intel chipped versions those were just barely able to keep up with the heat output of those Intel chips but they retooled everything for the arm chips which to me is like okay Microsoft at least on the hardware level is very committed or seemingly very committed to actually delivering a good product here because
they actually spent all the money and resources to retool this entire products lineup that's good to hear now in terms of ports you get an extra USBC on the left side and on the right side is just the surface connect okay the performance of this chip so these chips the Snapdragon X Elite and the Snapdragon X Plus they're both supposedly awesome but we've only seen it with synthetic benchmarks and stuff that the companies have demo mode with intent the real question and really think the only kind
of potential problem that we might see with this product is the support for nonnative apps so if you're new to this whole conversation of like arm chips with Windows devices all the stuff seems good so far right but the one weakness is a lot of Windows apps do not have native support for this type of Chip These Arm chips and we've been promised from the developers from Microsoft from Qualcomm that this time around they they've got it they've got it all covered the emulation will be good
everything will be solid but I need to see the performance with my own eyes on retail units none of this like Early Access stuff uh the other product from Microsoft is their Surface Pro 11 so this now has an OLED screen which looks quite a bit better than what they had previously because it's OLED the size seem the same and same with the bezels they didn't change it it's a good thing I think with a tablet you need to have a good amount of bezel so you're not like accidentally misclicking when you're
holding it as a tablet most of this device seemed completely unchanged from the exterior it still has the same clean design on the back and you still have easy access to the SSD by pushing the metal plate that has magnets holding it now at the time of shooting this I don't have specific pricing on any of those Microsoft service devices I was told that they'd be cheaper than I would expect but because of the live event I'll be updating any kind of pricing and extra details down the description but I
do think that they'll be cheaper than before but I do have two other devices that I think are arguably more interesting and I do have details and pricing the first one is this one this is lenovo's yoga slim 7x and this thing "starts at $1,200 and for the money you" get a crazy amount of Awesomeness in a laptop so this is a full metal design like classic yoga build right but the keyboard is just it's awesome this is a 1.5 mm travel it's strangely responsive but because this is so thin like look at
this thing man this is 1.29 millimet thin sorry 1.29 cmet thin so 12.9 millimet it's super thin super light at 1.29 kilos and it's like it it's crazy how compact this thing is with a 14-in screen so this is a 14.5 in OLED panel that gets super "bright I think it Peaks at 1,00 nits" this is all like pre-release or pre- retail soft or Hardware so I can't really I don't want to measure it and give you numbers but the the goal of it "is be able to hit 1,000 nits at Peak but" this thing is so good for the money
because typically if you're going to get a device like this with an Intel or AMD chip this thing would have been like "1,500 bucks easy but to get this kind of" performance and a 70w hour battery so the 70w hour battery combined with the Snapdragon X chip my guess they wouldn't give me numbers yet but my guess is it's going to be like a 20h hour claimed battery this is supposed to be a multi-day battery product uh I legit think they're going to be like this thing's 21 hours like out of the box
that would be crazy but again all the testing has to come later but for the money I think this is really solid the other product I want to dry your attention to is the Viva book S15 from Asus this is an even cheaper device "starts at $1,100 but this has a bigger" screen at 15 in it's also a really nice looking panel 120 HZ 3K but this isn't as premium of a product overall as the Lenovo Yoga slim 7x I do think that because of the bigger screen you'll also have a slightly shorter battery life
they both have 70w hour batteries but the interesting thing about this Asus product the Viva book S15 is it does have the highest wattage of the Snapdragon X laptops I've seen so far so 45 Watts at the top end you also get a lot of IO including two usba and an HDMI port and a Micro SD reader to boot so my initial impression on this whole like launch of Snapdragon X devices it's just so much better than I than I thought it would be like when they first announced it we saw all the launch partners and it
seemed like okay there's a lot of companies on board but I'm impressed by the caliber or devices that are coming out the fact that Microsoft like retooled their surface laptop Hardware finally but for arm devices like that's telling uh and then you just saw like two other really good devices like I think the the options are really good for consumers at this point don't go out and buy it until you see the retail like reviews I think my hope is that the emulation is going to be good enough it
it better be or else all of this is just going to go to waste but wait for the reviews uh I'll be doing pretty extensive reviews on the performance and the stuff so be tuned for that if you're interested uh but there you have it the Snapdragon X laptops are finally here
