Samsung just had their event where they launched a lot of new hardware so they have two new phones the Z flip 6 and the zold 6 and they also have new earbuds they have the new Galaxy buds 3 Pro and they also have new watches including the allnew Galaxy watch Ultra now despite all this impressive new hardware they spent a lot of time talking about AI features that were just not really impressive uh okay let's start off with the hardware first so the Galaxy Z flip 6 comes in four colors we have the blue
a mint yellow and Silver Shadow the Silver Shadow color is still an aluminum device but it has that kind of titanium look now there's three main Hardware updates over the previous generation first it now has 12 gigs of RAM instead of eight even the base model has 12 gigs of RAM now on the flip 6 secondly we "have a bigger battery it's 4,000 millah" now thirdly the main camera now uses a 50 megapixel sensor the ultrawide still uses the same sensor as the previous generation now the screen sizes on the
flip unchanged both the inside screen and the outside screen are the same as before uh and also the weight remains unchanged and the dimensions are also very similar for all intents and purposes it's the same dimensions it's a little bit thinner than the previous model but it was imperceptible when I was holding in my hands aesthetically there aren't a lot of changes on the flip 6 now the fold is a different story the Galaxy zold 6 has three new colors so we got the Silver Shadow again pink
and navy but this is a different dimensioned product it's thinner and lighter this year and it's also a little bit shorter but wider and because of these changes we now have new screens so we have different aspect ratios on these screens even so the front screen is a little bit bigger at 6.3 in it's a little wider and the main screen on the inside still measures up as a 7.6 in screen but it's also a slightly different aspect ratio than the previous generation also a little bit wider and
you can tell like I didn't have any of the specs or information in front of me when I was first looking at them and I just felt like these were wider screens than the previous generation the camera system appears to be running the same Hardware so it's still got the 50 megapixel gm3 as the main shooter but it is contained in a different kind of camera bump so each lens now has a series of these concentric rings and I think they look nice but those Rings were weirdly sharp like if I rubbed them
with my fingertips my skin cells would appear on those Rings uh it still has 12 gigs of RAM and the same battery size so "it's still has a 4,400 mAh battery it's" just like a more refined version of what they had going on but both the flip and the fold 6 are running the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip which is obviously better performance mostly noticeable in the GPU so if you're someone that's chasing performance there is a bit of a bump okay next up is what I think is the most interesting piece of Hardware they
showed it's the Galaxy buds 3 and the 3 Pro so since 2016 Samsung's wireless earbuds have all shared the same kind of design language they have these compact buds that have no stems and they just look nothing like Apple's airpods even the cases are unlike Apple's airpods they normally have have these like Square cases or maybe pill-shaped cases it's like uniquely and iconically Samsung designed even on their website they had like articles talking about how you know the design language and how
they chose it over the years and why they go with the stemless design so you can imagine my surprise when they revealed the new Galaxy buds 3 and the buds 3 Pro and these things had stems and they also just looked very apple-esque to me now in my short time using them I will say that controlling these with the stems and squeezing them is more precise than just tapping the sides of the previous buds I've always found those a little bit harder to control but it's strange to me that they
took such an iconic design and just replaced it overnight now the buds 3 Pro and only the Pro Models has a light strip that lights up when there's like 30% battery or more and you can control the lighting a little bit in software and there's also colorcoded markings like blue and orange for left and right and it does make it easier to put them into the case correctly I do want to add they sounded really good I wasn't able to measure them obviously at an event like that but switching back and forth
between the Apple airpods Pro 2 and the Galaxy buds Pro 3 and just between the two again a short listening test but I definitely prefer the Galaxy buds they just sounded better uh okay the last piece of Hardware their watches so they have the new Galaxy watch 7 but the new star of their Smartwatch lineup is the Samsung Galaxy watch Ultra and like the Apple watch Ultra it's built to be more rugged it has a longer battery and it's made out of titanium so I'm not surprised that Samsung made an ultra
watch but I am surprised that it's got a more squish shape like the whole Samsung Galaxy watch lineup has always just been round watches so this is It's just again deviants from their regular design but I do love the look of the ultra especially the white colored one like that thing looks so nice in real life the white strap with the white on the casing God damn it's sick uh there is a quick button on the side it's got like orange color accents now in my short testing with it the only thing that that button
could do on the unit that I was testing was that it was just launch workouts but I'm assuming in software you can adjust it the bezel doesn't rotate it just has markings that might trick you into thinking that it does uh and the watch face that I saw on it had a very technical vibe to it I thought it looked really nice uh it is water resistant to about 100 m and it works at a wide range of temperatures and at high altitudes and has a siren that you can activate in emergencies now the strap is a very soft
rubber strap it's a very similar looking strap to the stock Apple watch Ultra strap which is actually seemingly built for divers but the Galaxy watch Ultra is not a dive watch in the sense that like I don't think it has a depth gauge which at least from my understanding like the spec sheet that I looked at and when I asked to Samsung like does this have a depth meter they said it didn't which is surprising to me like I I feel like on a watch called the ultra with the ability
to go to 100 meters deep I mean why why is there no depth sensor not that everyone's diving but like I don't know that just feels like something they could and should have put on it uh okay so that's the hardware and it's really cool stuff but I want to move over the conversation to the AI software because I I feel like Samsung spent a lot of time talking about AI stuff okay so I'm going to rewind a little bit in January of this year so 2024 January when they launched the s24
products Samsung kind of officially launched Galaxy Ai and this product stack was cool they had some AI photo edting tools like generative fill they had some live translation tools that actually work really well with the new flip because it's got that popup screen uh you also can summarize big walls of text into Point form notes and there were other tools but I think most users would agree that as fun as these features were to play with and as cool as they might seem on paper none of it
was like a must-have feature for 2024 it was all just neat so when Samsung at this event was like Hey we got some new features there was a part of me that was doubtful so the big one they showed was a new sketch to image where you can crudely Draw Something on the screen and Galaxy AI would generate an image for you now I tried it a few times and I think the idea is cool it's fun to play with for a bit but for one it's really slow like the weight time is heavy and then the results are just not great like
I drew a ninja turtle and got a few variants that were comical like I get that the results will get better in time as the model gets better but it just feels like this type of stuff is not useful for most people now there is another thing they showcased where they had AI Tools in notes that could assist your writing like you can use it to check your spelling and grammar or you can use it to change your writing style like you can write a poorly crafted message and then the AI will give you a
few options to make that message more professional or more polite like this is all stuff we've seen before on other platforms and it's good that Samsung's bring it to their users uh but they also had this like generative AI storytelling tool where you could prompt it with a little bit of guidance and then it would write a full story for you like the idea of it is interesting I guess but it's more of like a tech demo right you look at it and you're like hey that's kind of
neat but very few people would actually use most of these tools I think like the grammar and spelling sure but come on man like I look at that stuff I'm like what why is this the headlining AI feature that they're showing right now especially when you have stuff like apple Intelligence on the horizon where Apple wants to be to access your emails and your calendars and your contacts and your messages and be able to just derive context out of all that stuff to deliver a digital assistant like that AI product
that they are claiming to be able to deliver is really cool it's super ambitious who knows if they'll actually be to deliver it but that when people see that Apple intelligence product it seems like there's real utility there the Samsung Galaxy AI stack it just feels it just feels like so broken up into pieces and I can't I can't foresee how all of it ties together for Samsung now I do imagine that they must be working on something that's like a bigger picture thing they they have to
right especially because of the competition but right now after this event I look at I'm like I I can't Envision it yet I still can't but there you have it awesome Hardware as always from Samsung but what do you think is a software that cool
