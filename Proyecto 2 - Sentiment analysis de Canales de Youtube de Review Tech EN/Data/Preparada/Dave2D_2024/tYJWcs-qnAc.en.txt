I was conflicted as to whether or not I should even review these phones because these phones are incomplete out of the gate the iPhone 16 devices are missing what many would argue to be the most important feature Apple intelligence it's even the thing that Apple says these phones were built for a new generation of iPhone built from the ground up to deliver Apple intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities you can't properly test out the full Apple intelligence experience
so feel strange to review it but these phones are going to be available in the stores in a couple days I thought I would do a review based on what you do get just keep in mind that a lot of the features of what these phones are supposed to do come in the future okay when you unbox the phones this year the classic Apple stickers are no longer around it's just paper pamphlets and then the charging cables are coiled up into ovals instead of the circles from before they're the same length of cable
they're just wound up differently now the colors on the regular non-pro models are very vibrant this year they just pop and if you think about last year when they first came up with that way to deposit colors into glass and just do that subtle pastel stuff they just took it to 11 and you get these very colorful phones this year and I was a little bit disappointed that I got the ultramarine blue instead of the teal for the review unit like not that it matters I have to send these things back anyways but I
just I just wanted the teal I was hoping I would get it they didn't send it to me uh the pro devices no colorful options this year the closest to a color is this thing the desert titanium it's a nice color I get it this is a very in color too right now in terms of like fashionable colors but I don't know it's just strange to me that the pro devices didn't get any kind of vibrant colors this year they usually do so these are the four new phones this year we have the iPhone 16 the 16 plus the 16 Pro and
then the 16 Pro Max and all four of them have the action button this year only the Pro Models had them last year but now they're on the top left and all of them have it so the regular iPhone 16s no longer have the hardware toggle which is I think a lot of people are going to miss and then on the right side of each phone or like the right edge of each phone there is now the new button which is called camera control they don't like calling it a button but it is a button because you can press down on it and it
depresses like a button but we'll come back to the camera control in a minute uh the screens on the iPhone 16 and 16 plus haven't changed from the previous generation so these still have a 6.1 and 6.7 in display respectively they're very nice screens in terms of image quality for regular media but they're still 60 HZ panels and when you use them just swiping around they if you're used to high refresh panels these feel strangely sluggish for a 2024 device especially one that cost $800 and $900 respectively
I hope I really hope that this is the last year that Apple does this at least that's the rumor now the screens on the pro devices are bigger these are now 6.3 and 6.9 in now if I'm being honest I really think most people would have a tough time telling these new screens apart from the previous generation from the iPhone 15 Pro devices the only real way to tell is by looking at the bezel so this is a 15 Pro Max and the older device has a noticeably thicker bezel but again you just really have to be
looking for it now one thing I did notice about the 16 Pro Max uh and also the 16 Pro but it's more prominent on the pro Max I remember last year talking about how in certain games the inner parts of my palm would touch the screen like the edges of the screen and would cause some accidental inputs it is even more pronounced on the 16 Pro Max I think the bezel is just like so thin that it's very easy for an accidental input on stuff like this so I think a case fixes it but if you are someone
that goes caseless for whatever reason you're just clicking things by accident sometimes that's just the nature of very thin bezels and keep in mind this is only for games when you're like actually gripping it tight like this watching shows and stuff not an issue the ceramic shield glass on the new iones are supposed to be 50% stronger than the previous generation but if you do want a screen protector the new ones from dbrand are really good and they're super easy to put on the regular iPhone 16s
are pretty much the same size as the previous generation but the pro devices are bigger because they have slightly bigger screens but it's so slight like this is the 15 Pro Max versus 16 Pro Max you can barely tell the difference both visually and in your hand uh okay let's talk about performance so as you would expect new phones new chips better performance the Pro Models have a new thermal substructure which is supposed to help with heat for sustained performance I didn't really notice a big
Improvement when I was testing for it with my regular genjin impact test iPhones especially the Pro Models have typically been really good for thermal dissipation amongst all phones but from all the testing I've done on these they're all very fast and the regular iPhone 16s get a big fat GPU boost over the previous generation it's a really nice upgrade for the regular 16s this year they're using larger batteries this time and from my light testing like light load testing it is crazy how long
the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasts it's kind of strange I really think it's just to be able to support the energy use of Apple intelligence especially for stuff like on device image generation uh so the wired and wireless charging speeds are quite fast this year if you have the right Chargers to pull it off you can get some higher wattage into these devices uh okay let's talk about that camera control button thing uh let's start off with this blue one okay wrong side again camera control so
this is a capacitive pressure sensitive button type thing now one of the main purposes of this button is to launch a upcoming feature called visual intelligence it's a part of Apple intelligence and it's designed toble to you know you press this button and it'll give you basically Google Lens functionality you can point the camera at something and it'll give you information as well as some kind of AI assisted feedback as to what the thing is that you're looking at now because
it's not available yet there's no point even talking about it but the other thing that this button is supposed to be able to do is camera control and that's kind of like the main name that they're giving it right now camera control so at the basic level you press it and it opens the camera app you press it again you take a picture if you press and hold it it starts rolling video now the basic functionality is awesome I think that you know with one hand you can pick up your phone take pictures take videos
without repositioning your hand one-handed it's awesome but there's way more to it so Apple has built an entire UI around that button inside the camera app and you navigate around this interface using this camera control button thing now my initial impression when I used it at their demo was that it was a little confusing to use and I thought the interface even though simple was difficult to navigate with all these different inputs like sliding and tapping with varying pressure but after
using for a week I would say that the interaction itself is very intuitive it's just that the interface and the idea of controlling your camera like this I'm not sure if it's something most people would actually want to use like when you navigate around you still have to use two hands this is not a one-handed operation launching it and just taking the picture yeah you can do that with one hand on that button but if you want to actually navigate around and slide around with your finger you
definitely need two hands and I don't know if it's any faster or more convenient than just using the on screen buttons it does also work in the vertical orientation but I just just found this to be an uncomfortable grip I don't think people typically hold their phone this far down the sides so it's like this weird claw grip you kind of have to go two hands again in vertical mode now there are some features that I do think that using the sliding mechanism is better so there's two that
come to mind the first is like Zoom because when you use pinch to zoom it can kind of be fairly inaccurate to kind of like nail it just right but with that slide mechanism you can kind of you know you slide around and you get a good feel of how much you need to move your finger the other menu that I think works well with camera control is their new photographic Styles menu so this is kind of like algorithmic processing of your shots that you take it's non-destructive and you can play with it but the reason
why it works so well with the camera control interface is because there's so many to choose from there's five skin undertones and then there's like nine photo tones and you get 14 to flip through and if you're just using the on screen controls there's like a lot of flicking and swiping but with this it's just you're sliding around it's like a care cell just choosing the style that you want and you can f tune each one to your preferences but I don't know how often I would personally use a feature
like that I played with it and I just could not imagine a scenario when I was just regularly using this thing to be able to take pictures a certain way but I'm really lazy with my photos I'm just like very much point and shoot so I would say that for the average person if you're just if the way that you've used your camera for most of your life is just point and shoot I don't think the camera control interface like this whole thing is all that useful if it's it really feels like it's geared for people
that like to manually tweak their shots and then it makes you think how many people really do that and then if it's not a lot of people why is it on all of the devices like even the non-pro versions of these phones like the regular iPhone 16s they have this camera control as well my gut feeling is that this button thing will be used mostly for just launching the camera app taking photos and videos and uh Apple's visual intelligence when it comes around okay the camera system so the iPhone 16 have
what they're now calling a 48 mapel Fusion camera now it seems to be the same Hardware as the iPhone 15 the images do look better on the 16 if you look closely especially when you use that 2x telephoto but it's subtle differences you really need to look for them the ultrawide cameras have also been updated on the 16s as well these now have a new 12 megapixel sensor that can shoot macro photos as well it is noticeably better in low light photos compared to the 15 from last year but
it's still not as good as the competition I think like Samsung and Google have really good low light Ultra wide cameras in their normal tier phones the pro phones also have an updated 48 megap Ultra wide this is a noticeable step up from the previous generation like the low light in particular looks quite a bit cleaner uh the main shooter has also been labeled as a new 48 megapixel Fusion camera it's supposed to be a faster sensor but from the shots I was taking I couldn't really tell much
of a difference between the new 16 Pro Max and the 15 Pro Max from previous generation that new sensor though does allow for 4K 120 shot from that sensor the mics on all the new iPhone 16s have a neat feature where when you use the phone for video recordings you can then go to the camera app in post and you can adjust and clean up the audio from the capture check this out so I have some pretty loud environmental noise going on it's coming from a YouTube video that's off that's on but I'm talking at a
pretty normal talking volume I'm not talking super loud or anything but you'll see how good this app is at removing that sound we've seen third party apps and tools like this before but to see it built into the phone and have like the mics send the spatial data to be able to calculate it better it's just neat I think they've done a really good job of just taking advantage of the different mics on these devices okay real quickly let's talk about AI so all four phones this year have 8 gigs of RAM
and they also have the same kind of apple intelligence capabilities well they will when Apple intelligence fully Launches on these devices but all of the currently available Apple intelligence features are in beta still and they're the same few features that we've been testing on the iPhone 15 Pro devices so it's like asking Siri to summarize something or to ask it some like Loosely contextual questions or having it to clean up the photos they're neat but the more interesting and arguably more
useful features like having some kind of context aware Siri or the chat GPT integration or having the image generation those things are months away some of them coming out next year and it's weird to me how so many Apple intelligence features are really far away in terms of a timeline and it's also really weird to me how Apple marketed this whole thing like this is a phone that's available today it's available to be purchased two days from now and it was supposed to be designed
and built from the ground up for Apple intelligence yet we can't test the vast majority of Apple Intelligence on these things like it could be amazing in the very distant future but like I'm not saying they should rush it I'm not sure they should release it now but I'm just saying they shouldn't have marketed these phones as these AI or apple intelligence phones when it's missing so much of the equation right now if I'm being honest I think the pro phones will have a tough time selling this year
there just isn't enough of a kind of feature differentiator to pull people to it I don't think uh the regular 16s they seem pretty good but yeah that's my take on the new iPhone 16s
