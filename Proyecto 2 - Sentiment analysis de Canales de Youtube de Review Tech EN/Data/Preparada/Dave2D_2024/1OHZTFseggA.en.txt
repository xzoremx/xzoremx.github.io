let's talk about the new Apple watches so we have the Apple Watch series 10 and Ultra 2 in the New Black colorway now series 10 at the launch announcement seemed like this very mild iterative change and I think it's because they use the term all new design like when they announce the thing they're like series 10 with its all new design and when you use that term there's this expectation that it's a wildly allnew design but this doesn't look like an all new design does it and it's because they weren't
referring so much to the Aesthetics but more about how the design has a lot of new functional features so the big thing that they're touting is the bigger screen which was a little misleading in the marketing material because when they say it's 30% bigger they were comparing it to series 4 5 and 6 so if you do compare to older watches like Series 2 and three it is way bigger on series 10 and series 456 yeah it's 30% bigger but against Series 7 eight and n it is bigger they're able to squeeze an extra
line of text in there but visually it's quite insignificant but also when they say that it's a larger screen than the one on watch Ultra I sure it is technically but again very slight now if you look at the pictures the bezel on series 10 does actually look a little bit thicker than the one on Series 7 8 and9 and it is but it's more it's kind of like an optical illusion because they've just removed some of the metal frame material and they've just added extra glass so yeah
there is a larger bezel but it would have been metal frame frame material anyways in addition to having a larger display series 10 is supposed to use a new type of OLED Tech called a wide angled OLED that's supposed to give you better viewing angles when you view these displays off axis so if you're kind of glancing down your watch you're supposed to be able to see it better now series 10 is supposed to give a 40% brighter display than series 9 when it's viewed off AIS but for me I don't see
that much of a difference now both of these are set to the lowest brightness and when I tilt it before they turn off uh I mean the difference is there but it's slight very slight to me I'm not seeing 40% now I do think it's more noticeable on certain watch faces and it does improve the overall Energy Efficiency of the screen now there's another feature on series 10 that's interesting on the display so typically on all the aods before the always on displays it would always refresh at the maximum of once per
minute so you could never have a secondhand showing on your aod but with the new display it does have a visible secondhand on certain watch faces so only have two right now this one's called flux uh but you can see like the second hand ticking and I'll show you a different one I think the other one's called Reflections that's it and again uh even in aod mode you can see a secondhand timer now I personally I love this like if you're cooking or something you don't have to keep like twisting
your your wrist to kind of keep track of seconds which I do pretty frequently but it's a little bit strange that it only works right now with two of the watch faces and it seems like it's like the really simple ones the ones with no other complications cuz all the other ones that I've tried uh all the other complications that have like a secondhand timer if I go into aod mode the secondhand timer disappears I just there and I mean it's nice that this Tech is there now but I feel like
they're going to have to redesign a ton of the uh watch faces to take advantage of this it is only ailable on series 10 right now not even the Apple watch Ultra 2 gets it there's another feature that's unique to series 10 and it's the ability to play music on the built-in speaker temperary expectations it's a watch but  like the watch also has a new depth sensor and temperature sensor it measures up to 6 M deep or about 20 ft uh Apple watch Ultra 2 by comparing goes to 40 m deeper like I think 130 ft so
it's much more capable on Ultra this is meant more for snorkeling but I threw it into a crude water pressure tester and it seems like the hardware just stops measuring past 22 ft like I gave it a few more pumps to simulate some extra depth but it just never recorded past 22 ft I still think it's awesome like having a depth gauge on any watch is always like such a treat even if you just go swimming you never snork you swim and you just have access to like some some deep water you just go down
and just see how deep you've gone it's always fun now some thoughts about the New Dimensions this is 10% thinner around 10% thinner than the previous generations so a millimeter thinner and when they announced it during the presentation I was like who cares like no one's asking for thinner Apple watches but when you try this thing on not only is it noticeable right away like the thinness is very very obvious but it actually fits much nicer than older Apple watches and much more like a
regular watch and it's because of the location of the I don't want to call them the lugs but it's like the portion that the strap connects to so on a regular watch you'd call them the lugs but because of the strap mechanism it's not quite that but they made the device thinner not just from the top like they didn't just shrink the top portion of the watch they Shrunk the bottom portion and what ends up happening is that the watch straps now come out closer to the surface of your skin and it just makes
it feel much more like a typical watch that you would buy uh okay the other thing they've changed is the battery charging speed so this is now a significantly faster charging battery but it doesn't last longer it's still rated as an 18-hour battery which I think is unfortunate like they had the tech and the capability to shrink it down and instead of just packing that extra 10% of space with more battery they just made it thinner I think at this point it's safe to say that Apple
like they're just shooting for a target of 18 hours I I feel like they do this on like the iPad the iPad like their targets 10 hours and I think on Apple watch their target is 18 hours and you know anything beyond that any Tech that they have access to that could extend it I don't think they go for it they just go for like a smaller package and at first I was like really bothered by this and then I thought about it and I did have this thought I tried to see from Apple's perspective which a little bit
dangerous but I was like why why wouldn't they extend the battery that's the one thing that everybody would want right I did realize that like okay let's say they did extend the battery to let's say like 22 hours 24 hours right somehow this became a 24-hour battery this is still a device that would need to be charged every day like that's where it is right now it's an 18-hour battery and for most people they go through their day and they still have to throw it into the charger regardless of what they're
doing the next day or how lightly they use it it's an 18- hour battery and if they extended it by another four five 6 hours it's still not enough to be like a 2-day battery so maybe that's why they just kept it at 18 it's like that sweet spot for them where they keep it thin light small but long enough enough that's my theory at least now there is a new color the regular series 10 now comes in a black anodized polished aluminum that they call jet black I'm not a fan of this color but I think it's
going to be wildly popular people just love shiny black watches I get it but this is an anodized material it's not like a PVD coating it's not DLC coating it's just straight up anodization uh it's a 30 step anodization so I imagine it's better than many other anodized materials in terms of durability but it's still anodization and this will invariably chip and scratch over time it's just the nature of anodized Metals uh but it does look I guess for people that are into that nice so overall I
think series 10 is a decent improvement over the previous generations I just wish they hadn't called it an allnew design because when you use that term it just paints it in a different light uh but I do think it's just like a bunch of quality of life improvements that I think a lot of people would appreciate but if you do want better battery life you're not going to get it here you got to go to Apple watch Ultra or in this case Apple watch Ultra 2 and the big change this year is a color so it comes
in Black now and it's a DLC coating it's very durable one of the most durable Coatings you can get on a watch and because it uses this process to give it this color it's likely much more scratch resistant than the anodized aluminum product that we saw earlier uh but yeah this is the black Ultra Watch 2 now I much prefer the color of the kind of original natural titanium but that's just my personal preference I like the way that kind of colored straps and stuff work on the raw titanium uh okay
I've never done a kind of video or review of the ultra watchat I've been wearing this for two years and just kind of a thought some some thoughts about it so the reason why I use the ultra watch is because of the long battery life I think that's the the main and possibly only draw to it uh don't really need the depth sensor as fun as it is it's just the massive battery life makes a huge difference from just my charging habits and how I use my device now the question that I often get asked by my friends and
family is like has this improved your health like has the acquisition of an ultra watch or just an Apple Watch has it improved your physical health so I've been pretty consistent with using it over the past couple of years and I would confidently say that it does like I really believe that if I hadn't have used the Apple watch Ultra or just any kind of Apple watch over the past couple of years I don't feel like I would be nearly as motivated to exercise and work out and just be physically active
partially it's the gamification of it all like the Rings and ever but also it's just having a bunch of friends and family that use these things and just feeling like you should work out when they do it's the stupidest thing but it's strangely powerful as a motivator uh like this is just my personal experience so if you've been on the fence after all these years years at least that's just been my experience with it uh there's one thing I want to last one last thing I want to address
and I saw it pop up in the comments of my video from the September event it's the idea of will the Apple watch have any kind of like apple intelligence stuff this year and or in the future and it doesn't this year at least not the way that you would think Apple intelligence is like you can't ask it you know generative questions and stuff like that but I think that that whole capability is really far out into the future this is a very low power energy efficient device this is like very it's
got a tiny battery it sips away at it over the course of the day you can't throw that type of computational power on device at least I really don't think it'll happen for quite a while okay there you have it that's my take on the new Apple watches hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
