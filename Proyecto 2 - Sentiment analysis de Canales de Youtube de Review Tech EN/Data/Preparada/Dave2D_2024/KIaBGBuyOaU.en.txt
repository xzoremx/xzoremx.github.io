Dell just announced two new laptops to their XPS lineup the XPS 14 and 16 now the design language of these two products were derived from the XPS 13 plus from the past this has now been renamed or rebranded to the XPS 13 uh but the two new ones are the XPS 14 and 16 so these are the two devices here the one on the top is in a platinum silver color and underneath is the graphite color so the 14inch is the smaller one now when they first showed this I thought what is the point of having a
14in device over the 13in device right I mean they're so similar in size but it stems to just one main thing performance so on the XPS 13 product you were never able to configure this with a discrete GPU if you wanted something from Nvidia for something that's more graphically capable was not possible because you just this is such a small and Tiny form factor can't do it but they've been able to do it into the 14 inch now on this device you can get up to an RTX 4050 but
look at the magic of this look at that thing this is a beautiful looking interior so like the previous devices there's no physical touchpad or visibly physical touchpad it's all built into this glass bottom panel here uh you just see real quickly you have a completely normal trackpad experience but all of that clicking is a haptic feedback it's not like a physical thing that moves up and down and you also have this lattice keyboard that is very clean looking I still think this is one of the nicest
looking interior designs to a laptop and also you have that top row for your function keys and media control keys and because there's a little more room on the 14-in device you now have front-facing speakers that are visible so on the XPS 13 product just going to place it right on top here there were no speakers that you could see they were underneath the keyboard so the audio quality wasn't as good on the 14in they actually sound a little bit better now because this is a pre-production unit I
can't kind of demo it properly at least not with the confidence that I would like but just for my ears these do sound noticeably better than the 13in uh now in terms of the actual performance this is running a meteor Lake chip Intel's newest and most energy efficient chip and you also get slightly increased wattage on this larger device compared to the 13-in but also new for this year is an upgraded webcam so if you seen my previous video on the XPS 13 plus you did not have great webcam quality
because of the super thin bezel it's now improved to a 1080p resolution with noticeably better image quality also the bezels on the screen are still super thin just like the whole XPS family but look at that man that is a super super clean 14-in display now the typing experience is largely the same compared to the previous generation of this lattice keyboard but one thing I noticed just as I was shooting it the XPS 13 uh the 13 plus that I have here from the previous gen it actually has has a
larger width of keyboard than the 14 even though this is a 13-inch device that's technically smaller this keyboard is a little bit wider than the 14 it's only because of these Edge Keys like on the 13-inch because there was no speakers on the side they could just extend these Edge Keys all the way right to the trim but here because of the speakers they've had to kind of keep them constrained so if you actually compare them the 13-in actually has a slightly larger keyboard or wider
keyboard than the 14 so so typing on these super clean keyboards is pretty fast to get used to but I don't think my top speed is as fast on this type of keyboard as like a traditional laptop keyboard so this device here the XPS 16 is my favorite of the bunch primarily because it has the most power this goes up to an RTX 470 equipped configuration and again super clean keyboard super clean trackpad with the super clean lightup function keys up top uh I think this is just like such a nice looking
device plus the color it's like this like dark gray I've always liked this graphic color they had on the XPS products the 16inch obviously has its larger screen and also maintains the very high image quality that You' expect from an XPS product but you also get higher wattage components in this larger chassis because there's a little more space in there more powerful cooling you can pump up the wattage on the CPU and GPU now keep in mind that all this Hardware is pre-production so some of
those internal components may change on the final units uh but one other thing the keyboards here there's this like button here that looks a little bit different and this is to launch Microsoft's co-pilot right now this is just a sticker so it looks a little bit strange but eventually in the future the production versions of this will have an actual co-pilot logo on that key right now this is just the control key with the sticker on top uh so real quickly I just want to show the ports on it so on
the 14 and 16 they share basically the same ports on the right we have a micro SD a headphone jack and a USBC and then on the left side we have a PIR pair of USC's now in terms of the power supply for both of these there's 130 WT for the 16in and then 100 watt for the 14in but yeah that's just an early look at the new XPS 14 and 16 I think these are very nice looking devices with seemingly very solid performance with the new meteor Lake Hardware inside okay hope you guys  video
