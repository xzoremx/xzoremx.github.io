when Intel launched their lunar Lake laptops one of the big things that stood out was just how powerful and energy efficient the gpus were and I think for a lot of people myself included we wanted to see some kind of gaming handheld that would take advantage of that chip because it just seem so promising this is the first one on the market the MSI claw 8 AI it's a terribly long name now before I begin I need to preface this video with just a thought last year I did a video on the first MSI
claw the first first generation one and I did a video on the early Hardware I wasn't allowed to Benchmark it or test it and I felt like I got burned because when the device actually launched the performance was poor the battery life wasn't great and I felt like MSI had overhyped what the product would be able to do mostly because of the chip so this time around I've had this device for over a month and I purposefully waited until the drivers came out so I could test it properly and talk about the
performance and this time I think there is something worthy of video okay this device outperforms the RG Alx and other Z1 extreme devices on most gaming titles I'd say that the Intel 258 V is just a better chip overall for handheld gaming now it's still very early on in the launch of this product so some titles don't work perfectly but you can already tell that it's a solid performer and it can only get better over time now in terms of image upscaling Tech so Intel has XCS AMD has their FSR Tech I much
prefer Intel's iteration of this kind of Technology especially on handhelds like your face is right up to the screen you're holding these things close and when you have any kind of artifacting from amd's FSR which is just more more noticeable on 's version of it it just takes away from the experience so uh I like that the Intel version is so good but there's not a ton of games that support it still so it's only like 200 plus titles on Steam I just think that grows over time one thing to keep in
mind though that AMD chip that Z1 extreme that's in here is a pretty old chip it came out like the spring of 2023 so it's almost 2 years old so I'm not surprised that a new Intel chip can outperform it if anything I'm surprised it took that long but this is The Benchmark that Z1 extreme is the chip that's in all of the kind of top performing Windows handhelds right now there are other AMD chips like the HX 370 but those aren't particularly energy efficient and I don't think many
companies will be using it for handhelds now the battery life on the MSI claw 8 AI plus is quite good it's running an 80w hour battery so it's fairly big and because you can easily set the DDP and settings it's very consistent and predictable in terms of battery life also fan noise is very quiet it is running a very energy efficient chip so it's relatively easy to cool it silently uh but also the idle power draw is way better than the first generation of the MSI claw and I think having a lower
power consumption at that idle state is a really important characteristic of just having a good portable gaming experience uh now this device comes in two screen sizes there's a 7-in model which looks very similar in terms of like the hardware Aesthetics to last model and then this new 8 in model that does have a bigger screen and also the larger 80w hour battery now when you hold this thing the first time I pulled out of the box it is definitely bigger and heavier than the 7in claw but I
don't find it uncomfortable to hold or tiring to hold it even after an extended period of time this is actually very ergonomic device to hold uh I also prefer this device in terms of the Eros over the RG Alx this always felt a little bit flat and just not as comfortable to me but still the king of ergonomics is the steam deck this I don't know why I just love the way this thing holds like the kind of curved grip on the back just gives it really nice ergonomics in comparison but this I like
it it feels nice there's a Micro SD as well as two thund rope four ports up top if you want to connect to an external GPU but there's three kind of Hardware features I want to talk about the first is the display so this is an 8 in display 120 HZ variable refresh rate it is an IPS panel it's not OLED but I do like the resolution it's 1200p and at first when I saw that it was a higher resolution screen I was like huh I I typically prefer lower resolution screens on handhelds but because it can
handle it with the more powerful GPU I'm happy with that resolution the second thing I want to talk about though are the controls so the sticks and the d-pad and both of these components I did not like out of the box I thought that the sticks were too loose and just not springy enough I just felt like there just wasn't enough resistance as you moved it around and I also didn't like the d-pad in terms of how it felt now over time over this month because I've been using this so much I've grown to
really like the sticks I think you just adapt to the kind of resistance that you're given and your aim just adapts and your movement just gets used to it I'm good with the sticks but the d-pad over the month I've grown to dislike it more and more and I think anyone who plays game like let's say you play Street Fighter and you're doing quarter circles or half circles your thumb just gets shredded on this d-pad and I think it's because the ridges on this thing are so high I don't know why they made
it like this like maybe the MSI Engineers just don't play a lot of fighting games but this does does not feel good to me and I'm actually surprised it hurts as much as it does even after using it for a month just never got used to it uh the third thing I want to talk about the speakers these sound awesome I think these are the best sounding speakers on any gaming handheld right now uh they're just they sound great good volume as well now the price so this model the 8 in model starts at
$8.99 a $9 gaming handheld it is equipped with 32 gigs of RAM and a terab of storage but that is just a crazy expensive price point so I think the reason why it feels so expensive is that at this point in time a lot of the competitors have dropped down in pricing like they're a little bit older so you can get like 600 or even $550 devices that are so good so you have a $900 device that is better performing and it's got a ton of ram but it's still $900 so here's my take I think the
device is great and I think that it will likely be one of the better performing Windows handhelds we have avail available on the market but I would wait on this thing for that price to come down I feel like there's no way that they'll be able to readily sell this thing at that price point and because MSI is MSI they'll drop the price down and at that point I think this becomes a more palatable purchase uh but there you have it that's the new MSI claw 8 AI Plus
