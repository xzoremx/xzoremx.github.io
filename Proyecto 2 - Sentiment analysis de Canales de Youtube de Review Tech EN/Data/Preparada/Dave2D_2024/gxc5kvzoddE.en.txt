for the past four years since 2020 if you were on the market for a legitimate Windows alternative to the MacBook Air product you couldn't get one like that product didn't even exist because ever since Apple came out with their M1 chip no one could match that thing in terms of the overall package like something that was really well built with really good battery life and awesome performance like it didn't exist until today because we have something pretty special so this is from Lenovo it's
their yoga slim 7x and inside this thing is the new chip from Qualcomm the Snapdragon X Elite and when you take that chip and put it into a 14-in device like this you get something pretty special because you have awesome performance and you get nice design language really good build quality and you also get what I think is one of the best keyboards in this laptop space arguably the best and you also get a really nice 14 and 1 12 in OLED panel that's very calibrated right out of the
box and because this isn't an Apple product you dodge all of the Apple like apps so you get upgradeable storage and you have like the ports be able to connect multiple monitors to it on the base models let's get into this thing so the chip is very fast it's a little faster than the current stuff from Intel and AMD and it sits between the performance of Apple's M3 and M3 Pro now because it's an arm chip apps that run natively on arm are going to run the best but apps that have to go through
emulation so if you take like an x86 app like a pre-existing app that wasn't optimized or tuned specifically for this type of Chip they'll still run on it except there's a bit of a penalty now the thing is these new chips and the current emulation tools are so good you still get solid performance when you're emulating x86 like for my testing we're seeing a 10 to at worst a 15% performance penalty which is still really good and I think what that ultimately means is that we don't need
to depend on developers to make apps run specifically on arm like that'd be nice and when they do it that's even better but you can just take pre-existing apps and run it with perfectly good performance even apps like Adobe Premiere which lean on both the CPU and the GPU in the past if you tried to emulate premiere on an older arm chip it was a train wreck but now very viable uh a quick note about gaming these are not gaming laptops per se and there's not a lot of native arm games out there but
despite that the hardware is strong enough to handle some light titles at playable frame rates it's not amazing but casual gaming is very viable on this device so the chip is great but I want to go over some Hardware features that I think make this particular device interesting so first is the build quality I think a lot of the Snapdragon X Elite devices that I've seen have like mediocre build quality uh and I think it's kind of expected considering that these price points are lower but this is
"a $1,200 machine and it is super tanky" this is built really well like the top panel is very very firm and then the hinge has like no play on it I think I think the yogas are often made well but this is like particularly well done this device is also very light comes in at 1.28 kilos which is like 40 G heavier than what you see on the MacBook Air but despite its very similar weight this has a way bigger battery than what you see in the MacBook Air this has a 70w hour battery which is like I think like 30%
bigger than the MacBook Air and because of the massive battery and the crazy Energy Efficiency of the Snapdragon xelite you get Monster battery life I actually think this is the longest battery life I've seen on a 14-in laptop particularly if you're using it for streaming and it's also very quiet in all those tasks but to be able to get a 70w hour battery on a small chassis like this like that's that's uncommon that's a battery like that is typically for larger chassis uh so it's something
pretty special but then you got to see the screen so this device has a 14.5 in OLED panel that looks awesome it's x-ray calibrated it's fast it's responsive it's very bright it Peaks at a th000 nits and I think this display is just like infinitely better than the stuff that you get on MacBook airs like it's empirically a better screen across the board I would argue that this is a better screen than the screens you get on the MacBook Pros if I'm being honest here but uh the other thing that comes
with this kickass device is I think the best keyboard so it's Lenovo they own the ThinkPad IPS for the ThinkPad keyboards and I think these are just the best keyboards I'm super fast on these things and I just like the layout and there's no number pad which I'm a big fan of uh decent speakers as well the overall package is just so good now a real quick note on Windows co-pilot plus because the hardware that's in here the chip that's in here has an npu that gives this laptop access to an extra
layer of features in the newest version of Windows and currently you do need one of these Snapdragon X Elite chips to be able to access these features so they have a few that are interesting the first one that caught my eye is the co-creator in paint so this allows you to crudely Draw Something in the paint program and then it use text prompts to augment that image now I've only played around it for a little bit but it is strangely fun and it's easier to use than I thought it would be and because
you can draw that initial sketch you can kind of give some guidance as to what it is that you're trying to draw or generate and because it's built right into windows it's like very easy to access uh the other thing that was interesting was live captions so you can use it for real time language translation for videos like if you're watching a YouTube video or a movie and you you can also use it for calls like you could take a call for work and it'll translate that audio in real time which
is pretty cool uh the third thing I thought was neat were the studio effect where you can apply visual effects to your camera feed and they have your standard stuff like background blurs but they also have like the eye tracking stuff so you can kind of look away from the camera lens and it'll kind of reposition your eyeball so it could it looks like you're looking at the camera it's a little trippy but they also have some neat like cartoon effects that I thought looked pretty cool but all of
this stuff is seemingly done with the npu it doesn't pull resources from the CPU or GPU and I think that's the idea here that you're able to do all of these things without it taxing like the main processing capabilities of your chip uh but the most interesting feature of the co-pilot plus stuff was Windows Recall now this was something that I wish I could demo here but they pulled that feature for now while they work on it but the idea behind recall is that you'd be able to find anything from your
digital life because recall would constantly be taking snapshots of your screen and then it would build this timeline so if you ever need to find anything or refer to something from the past it' be able to go through that timeline and just find it now the idea of that is neat I guess like I mean it's powerful right if you want access to something like that it's neat but the security and privacy concerns around that whole mechanic is is wild so uh that obviously needs to be retooled and
rethought but all the other stuff on co-pilot plus seemed pretty neat just from the short bit of time that I've had with it but there you have it this is the yoga slim 7x there's very few devices on the market that can pull off what this thing does especially at its price point okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it
