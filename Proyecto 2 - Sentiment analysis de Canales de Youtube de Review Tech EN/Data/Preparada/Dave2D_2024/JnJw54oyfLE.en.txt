they've done it Intel has finally made a truly excellent laptop chip it took them like five or six years but it's finally here and I think be pleasantly surprised at how good this chip is so about eight or nine months ago Intel launched their series 1 core Ultra devices those things were already a big step up from their previous generation but those were just those were like good very good at best but this it's a whole new level so uh the launch device that they've gone with
to Showcase their new chip is the Asus Zenbook S14 this is a very thin very light 14-in device and this product right here is housing the top tier chip like the highest end chip that they have for the series 2 it fits in here it's cooled remarkably well for this device and let's get into it so this chip and this laptop it's all about three things really Energy Efficiency like extreme Energy Efficiency good C performance and really good GPU performance this kind of review unit launch device came with a
120 HZ OLED panel like you don't come out with this type of screen unless it's pretty good for games I'm just saying uh so let's take a look at the chip the chip in here is the Intel Core Ultra 9 288 V at the time of shooting this I can only show you Intel's first-party benchmarks so these are numbers that they got from their own testing but there's a few things to note here here the single core cinebench performance looks decent but when it comes to multi-core Performance it does well at
low wattages and it supposedly matches Apple's M3 product but it does start to lose ground at higher wates so if you'll notice the new AMD chip as well as the previous generation of core Ultra products those two devices seem to perform better at that higher wattage State it's in that low wattage or low power consumption area that this new chip really excels and from the perspective of a laptop reviewer that's the that's the thing that really matters like really good regular laptop
performance with awesome battery life that's what the vast majority of laptop users are looking for Intel actually claims this to be the most energy efficient x86 chip on the planet and that's what it seems to be at least based on their first-party Benchmark so far the other thing of interest is that the GPU and the gaming performance on this chip is surprisingly good for integrated Graphics so these are running the new Intel Arc 140v gpus and from the looks of their early benchmarks this is
the most powerful integrated GPU on the market it supposedly has better gaming performance than even the new AMD chips that came out a few weeks ago now it's also interesting that if you look at their benchmarks they did it at medium graphic settings now typically when I do any kind of gaming benchmarks on thin and light devices I always go with the lowest graphic settings I think that's just how people would typically play games on a thin and light device but they went with medium maybe because
they're just so confident that you know the the GPU performs well but it could also be that that's where the biggest gains are like at that Medium setting maybe at the lower settings it's not as impressive but regardless very impressive GPU and I will say that from the handful of games that I've tested those numbers are accurate now the biggest claim that Intel is making with these new Chips is in regards to battery life they are claiming some really monster numbers now in the past Intel's
slides have been questionable at best uh I would take those numbers with a grain of salt I think we'll have to see some proper reviews come in but just for my very limited testing on this device it it's very immediately apparent how energy efficient these systems are like you can just run them very quietly no fan noise with very long just kind of idle State battery life that was immediately apparent after the first day of use but if you look at the advertised battery life from Asus and other
manufacturers it's pretty clear that these new Intel chips will give you big battery gains over the previous generations of product now if you take a look at the inside the 72w hour battery takes up a very large portion of the inside like I don't think they could have made it much bigger so this is a very large battery for a 14in device uh you'll notice that the Wi-Fi 7 card is baked on the ram like all Intel Core Ultra products is also baked on uh the nvme fullsize nvme is removable the
speakers sound good there's four of them but we'll wait for retail drivers before we draw any kind of conclusions on them now the display uses a very nice looking 14in OLED panel and this is a very bright color accurate and very fast screen right 120 HZ but I'm surprised I guess kind of impressed that they went with this panel on the review units like if you're trying to Showcase a chip with really long battery life I would have thought they would gone with an IPS panel like just to extend battery life
even more but it's an OLED panel and it does look really nice and there's also this gometric grill that you see at the bottom of the screen like right at the top of the keyboard deck and this is a design element that you've seen on the Zenbook s16 as well it's new for this year it's like these Grill holes with even tinier holes on the inside it just adds this nice design element to the top of the keyboard it's got a nice keyboard types pretty fast and it's got nice white backlighting this gets pretty
bright and uh I think it's just like a very clean looking keyboard Deck with a nice uh glass trackpad and then the top panel has this ceramic polymer on it I've shown this in other Asus devices but they call it s aluminum I think it's just like a ceramic polymer on top of an aluminum top panel and it gives it this like Stone like texture like a Polish Stone finish I really like this like this has grown on me more and more the more I use this kind of device but it's a very nice looking premium feel to it
uh the ports so there's two USB uh C Thunderbolt 4 on the left side with an HDMI and then on the right there's just the single USPA I do wish that there was a USBC on both sides like I do think it's one of those things that when it comes to charging like some people like to come from the left or the right and it just now forces you to have to come from the left which is annoying for certain desk configurations but the overall product it is so much more energy efficient and so much more GPU
capable than what I would have expected like I had Fairly High Hopes And this exceeds it this is a very very nice trip from Intel packaging to a really nice laptop from ACS okay there you have it this is their Zenbook S14 with the new Intel Core Ultra Series 2 chip now if you'll notice this whole video never talked about any AI capabilities or AI features of this new chip or laptop and it's because I just I don't think we're at that point where AI really matters for most people despite all the
marketing and what Intel and basically every chip manufacturer trying to stuff down our throats there's just not a lot of products and or services that really lean on npus that people actually want to use on a daily basis so I think if you're looking at this product I would just for most people you can ignore all the AI stuff and just focus on what is actually useful and good about this thing very energy efficient awesome GPU really good CPU and that's to me all that really matters when it comes to a
laptop right now okay there you have it awesome chip really good laptop hope you guys liked this video thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
