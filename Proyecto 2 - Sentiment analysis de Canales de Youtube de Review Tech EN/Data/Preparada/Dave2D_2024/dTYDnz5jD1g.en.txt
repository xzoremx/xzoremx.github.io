so Apple's September iPhone event just went down and I went into this event with very low expectations but having used a bunch of the devices there's a lot more to unpack than I'd originally thought so let's start off with the iPhone 16 pro and pro Max so the new color for this year is the desert titanium it's like a cream colored back with kind of like a bronish trim I was just surprised that there was no bright or vibrant colorways on the Pro Models this year like there's no blue or green
Hues it was just like neutral tones uh but these devices are bigger this year so Dimensions just like holding them they didn't actually feel noticeably larger than the previous models like if I didn't know that they were bigger I may not have been able to tell just looking at the backs of them but the moment we flip them over the screens are noticeably bigger so it's a bigger screen on both the pro and the pro Max this year but it's not just the bigger screen it's the thinner bezels are
definitely noticeable the moment I picked them up now in terms of performance the new pro and pro Max use the new a18 Pro chip and this is a supposedly fairly decent Step Up in terms of performance on CPU and GPU and because this is more energy efficient ship this is now a longer lasting series of devices than the previous generation the new battery life claims from Apple do look quite good but it still uses 8 gigs of RAM that was very surprising to me like I thought that with all this new
AI Hardware that's in there that typically uses a lot of ram that it would require an elevated bump for across the board right but the pro devices both the 16 Pro and the 16 Pro Max both still have 8 gigs of RAM and this is like pixel devices the pro devices have 16 gigs of RAM like literally double the ram so I mean it's it's interesting to see the strategy that Apple's built for their AI integration and implementation but clearly it doesn't use a ton of ram now one AI feature that Apple showed at this
event that they did not show during WWDC was their new visual intelligence feature and the idea behind this is very similar to Google ends like you take your phone you activate the camera at something and it snaps a picture and visual intelligence will tell you what kind of dog it was that you just took a picture of or if you snap it at like a restaurant or something it'll show you the menu or possibly show you reviews but the idea is that it's using the camera and using some context of you
know how you're using it it'll now give you information that you might require now the implementation of this is not novel in anyway but the way they've done it is through a new physical button that you use to Launch visual intelligence and I think the way you do it right now is that you tap that button and you hold it for a second and then it'll launch however this whole visual intelligence feature is not ready yet I wasn't able to demo it at the event it's supposed to
launch towards the tail end of this year but the other thing that this button can do is that it can launch camera controls so they actually don't refer to this whole button thing as a button they actually call it camera control every time I use the word button in front of the Apple reps they be like no no no it's not actually a button it's called camera control control so you can use this camera control to launch the camera so if you tap it it'll launch the camera app and if you tap it again it'll take a
picture and if you hold it it'll Roll video but in addition to those kind of basic camera controls you can use it to go through the menus and basically just control your camera through a UI that's entirely dependent on that capacitive button thing so it is in fact a capacitive multi-function sensor that I'm just referring to as a button and I call it a button because when you put pressure on it it depresses down and when you let go it pops back up it's a very shallow press like we're
talking like less than a millimeter of travel for that button and there's also a capacitive sensor on the inside so when you slide your finger back and forth It's detecting that and also there's a haptic motor inside this whole thing a very faint one but you can feel like little bumps As you move around in the UI now this is I mean it's a very for for lack of a better term it's basically like a touchpad on the side of your phone it's a very Advanced haptic touchpad uh but very small on the side
of the phone but when I saw this in the presentation I was like this is awesome this is like such a cool and Innovative way to use your phone but I tried it in the demo area and my immediate reaction was like this is very complicated like there's a very steep learning curve as to how much pressure you need to use to activate stuff and how not to accidentally press too hard or press too lightly and as I looked around the room in like that whole demo era tons of people trying this out and it just you
could tell that people were like huh this is noticeably more complicated to use than the average apple ux or UI I do think that if you spent a lot of time with it you would get Adept with this whole interface and maybe at that point it would be very enjoyable to use but my just initial Impressions was this is more complicated than I would personally want on my camera controls also I would say that this is a very like rightand oriented user interface like the the right Edge has to be on the top of the
phone bu to use these controls properly the camera systems on the iPhone 16 Pros have a few things of interest to me first the tetr prism lens that only existed on the max model last year like the bigger one is now present on both models so now both the pro and the pro Max have the same camera system uh secondly there is now a 120 frames per second 4K resolution cinematic mode shooting option which uses an incredible amount of processing uh and toble to see that on a phone is actually it's kind of
Bonkers and thirdly the ultra wide on both the pro and the pro Max are now using a 48 megapixel sensor which I imagine will help significantly with just better quality Ultra wide shots that's something that the pro devices have never been amazing at compared to some of the competition all right onto the regular iPhone 16 so there's new colors these are more Vivid look looking color selection than the previous generation there's a pink there's a teal and there's an ultramarine all three of
them look pretty cool but that teal I mean that's just 100% that's the best color without a doubt uh it's just a really nice looking color for an iPhone you also get the new action button so this is a button that only existed on the Pro Models last year but now the regular iPhone 16s have them but you've lost the hardware toggle switch so that Hardware notification switch that would tell you if you're muted or not is now gone on all of the new phones uh they all have action buttons and then on the
right side of the phone you also have like the pro model this year the new button that's not officially a button now the back of the phone shows a different camera orientation from the previous generation so this now has a vertically oriented camera system it's got like iPhone 11 Vibes and the purpose behind this or as the reason as to why they mount it vertically is I think it's just to help with spatial VIs capture so when you're taking spal pictures or spal videos for that stereoscopic effect just
having them lined up in a linear fashion instead of like an angle before helps capture it better the regular iPhone 16s also have a new chip it's the a18 it's like the nonpr and this is a pretty significant jump up from the previous generation because the previous generation of kind of bass iPhones have used older chips and this time around because of the AI requirements and just uh the AI goals that Apple seems to have they've put a more powerful chip and also 8 gigs of RAM even on the regular
iPhone 16s and this new chip is supposed to give you 30% faster performance than the previous generation as well as significantly longer battery life at least that's what's being claimed by Apple now you still get of course 60 HZ screens and also USB 2 transfer speeds I don't mind the slower transfer speeds because I feel like that only affects nerds like me like how many people are actually plugging up and transferring photos and stuff that's well not acceptable that's understandable to me
what kills me is the that the 60 HZ screens like at this point there are $200 Android phones out there with 120 HZ displays and to see a 60 HZ display on this device like I think it's the thing it's the feature that Apple will continue to use to separate the pro model from the non-pro model it's like the best thing that they can use to separate the to and price them so distinctly differently it just it bothers me there were also some interesting announcements around some audio products so they now
have airpods 4 this is kind of like their entrylevel open wireless earbuds these supposedly have better sound quality and because there's the presence of the H2 chip there's also like adaptive audio and transparency mode all that cool stuff uh but the other thing is that airpods 4 has a second variant that has active noise cancellation and this was very interesting to me because like typically when it comes to noise cancellation especially active noise cancellation it's paired it's done best when you have a
sealed earbud kind of like their airpods Pro product and apple isn't the first company to try this uh Samsung's done a bunch of companies actually tried it and they're never great so I'm very curious how Apple tries to pull this off and it's just because when you don't have the airtight seal that you would typically have with UHC products you just have a really tough time producing a good amount of Bas and you need a good amount of Base to cancel out the lower frequencies that you're hearing right to
be able to do good noise cancellations so I'm just really curious to see how Apple does this uh the other product that they have well it's not really a product it's an update to a product they have the airpods Pro 2 getting a future software update that allows them to be used as essentially hearing aids like you would use your app and run a clinically validated hearing test that now allows the airpods pro two to like adjust certain frequencies to give you the effects of a hearing aid and these
are like easy to charge compared to like a regular hearing aid you like swap out the batteries and stuff this is so disruptive to me this is super cool now obviously airpod Pro two are not as comfortable as some hearing aids I imagine so maybe some like you know updated tips third party who knows but the idea of this is so cool and I would not be surprised if a whole bunch of other companies Implement something like this with their wireless earbuds in the future as well cuz it's just so useful
and it's like it's seemingly so obvious at this point after the fact it's like such a good idea so I want to see that thing rolled out airpods Max also had a bit of an update there's some new colors the blue and the purple look particularly cool and there's also USBC charging so essentially all of their audio products now are USBC charged which is great but there was no change in terms of like Hardware to their airpods Max like they're still using the same mesh there's no onoff button and
it's still the same price as it launched at it's like very expensive fouryear old pair of headphones at this point to me I'm sure the update is appreciated by many but it's just I'm surprised they didn't update the internals at least they didn't talk about them if they did uh there's also been updates to the watches so the Apple watch is now series 10 there's a few interesting changes first it's thinner which was immediately noticeable when I handled it but it's also bigger so the 41 mm is now a 42 mm
watch and then the 45 mm from before is now a 46 mm and there's also a improved display that allows it to have better viewing angles now when I looked at it in the demo area it wasn't immediately obvious to me but I couldn't compare it to an older Apple watch now there's also a new color called jet black this is a polished aluminum that looks almost like black stainless steel but I'm curious to see how this finish holds up over time you can now play music on the Apple watch speaker and it's also got larger
charging coils so you can now charge faster using the same charging puck as before it's just a more efficient coil so it just charges faster I think you can hit uh I think 80% in 30 minutes if I'm not mistaken and the series 10 Apple watches also get a new depth gauge so this was something that only the ultra watch got previously uh but now you can go up to 6 M or 20 ft and it'll keep track of that water depth underwater so there's a lot of features that have trickled down from the Ultra Series that
have just come over to the new series 10 uh but the ultra watch did not get any significant update there is a new color the the matte black look but it it's still Apple watch Ultra 2 not three now lastly the cases for the iPhones they have some new ones but they removed seemingly the whole fine woven products line that they were so proud of last year I did not like that material right when I tested that thing last year and I'm I guess I'm glad that it's gone I just felt like it wasn't really up to
Apple's standards uh but it's I don't think I've seen like a product like that where they just ran for a year and just pulled it silently but there we have it there's no fine moven material at least not that I saw uh okay there you have it uh there's a whole bunch of new products stay tuned for reviews in the future thumbs if you liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time
