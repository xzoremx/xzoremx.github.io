in the world of smartphones we are used to very small improvements year on year like maybe 5% or 10% better battery life or better performance or better Energy Efficiency and that's just the way the industry's always been so we're comfortable with those small gains every year but the next generation of phones are quite different because there's a chip from Qualcomm the Snapdragon 8 Elite that just changes the whole landscape of what this is like okay so I was able to test two phones uh the first
phone is this one this is the OnePlus 13 now this is the Chinese edition of this phone so I wasn't even going to do a review of it I just I got it in and I threw some games on it and I was immediately aware of just how much better the battery life was on this device the OnePlus 13 compared to the "OnePlus 12 but this has a 6,000 Mah hour" battery versus the 5400 we see on the OnePlus 12 and also they're running different screens this has the kind of curved Edge we've seen on a lot of
OnePlus devices this is the new flat front with the kind of rounded edges but it's just a new screen Tech that has local variable refresh rates so you can have different portions of the screen with different refresh rates depending on what's moving and what's not on the screen at any given time so it just gives you much better at least the possibility for better Energy Efficiency and also they're running different software this is running color OS because it's China and this is running
oxygen OS because this is like the global North American version I'm like these are just not great devices for doing comparison of how good or how different the new ship is but then I got in these phones the RG phone 9 Pro now this device is pretty much a clone to last year's RG Phone 8 Pro in the sense that it's got the same shape same design same screen even the new one does go to a higher refresh rate if you set it in the options but the battery on the RG phone 9 is around 5 to 6% bigger it's
not exactly the same but it's close and when I ran my battery test on these phones it's clear that the Snapdragon 8 Elite gives you so much more battery life than the Snapdragon 8 gen three like we're talking I'm going to say 25 to 30% is a conservative estimate I think for a lot of phones out there if you match everything equal it's probably closer to 40% it is a massive increase in battery life and it's particularly impressive if you go back a few years and just see how big of a jump this
really is now all this benchmarking you've seen for battery is on the heavier workloads like if you push this thing on multi-core performance or if you're just doing a lot of stuff or playing heavy games and stuff you'll notice really big gains for single core tasks like if you're just browsing Reddit for a long periods of time it's not as impressive in terms of year on-year gains but it's still a significant improvement over the previous generation but any device that
uses one of these new Snapdragon 8 Elite chips is going to see a big jump in battery life it's just like when was the last time we've seen a 30% increase in battery life in one generation of Chip like it's just it really has never been a thing for me uh the other thing to keep in mind I think that you know we're only looking at the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips like the top end stuff I imagine this trickles down to their mid M tier and entry level chips as well maybe not next year hopefully but I think this
technology just improves the entire lineup from qualcom soon now the reason for these big battery life gains is that this new chip Snapdragon 8 Elite is more energy efficient than the previous generation and we've seen really good single core and multi-core efficiency in terms of the CPU but the thing that was most impressive to me was the GPU so there's a game called genjin impact it's an old game at this point but every time a new chip comes out I like to take genjin and run it on those new Chips
just to see how far you can push that chip before it drops in performance because this is a game that loves GPU power it's a very demanding title and typically any phone that you throw at this game will eventually Throttle Down like the game will play these really nice graphics for a good amount of time and then at some point the phone gets hot and it has to lower its performance just to be able to keep up with the thermal constraints of the system but on both of these phones the OnePlus 13 and
the RG phone 9 it never throttled like it seems you can play genin at Max Graphics indefinitely at 60 frames per second it's something special now the OnePlus 13 is running slightly slower Ram than the ram that's inside the RG phone 9 Pro uh but both devices can do it they never got warm enough that they needed to throttle one thing to keep in mind I am in Canada it's November it's relatively cool right now so if you live in like a super hot country obviously you won't be able to do this but I've
never seen this on like stock devices without using the cooler or anything on the RG phone both of these phones are engineered with really good thermal Solutions on the inside like they have graphite sheets and stuff but it's mostly the chip that's doing the heavy lifting like it's just a really energy efficient chip but also with Energy Efficiency you get long battery life but you also get long battery like longevity in terms of like battery health because you know how a lot of phones have the
ability to control the charge limit you can drop down to like 80% when you have a really big and long lasting battery and you drop it down to 80% it's still a very longlasting battery and then now you just right you're you're you're just putting less wear and on your charge cycles because you can comfortably drop it down to 80% without worrying about it lasting a day and a half okay uh there you have it the Snapdragon chips I was wildly impressed the battery life is not something that I
ever thought that Qualcomm would be able to fix so quickly in just one generation and still call it like the Snapdragon 8 like I thought they'd have like a whole different naming moniker but yeah it looks really good this year very promising all right hope you guys enjoyed this video
