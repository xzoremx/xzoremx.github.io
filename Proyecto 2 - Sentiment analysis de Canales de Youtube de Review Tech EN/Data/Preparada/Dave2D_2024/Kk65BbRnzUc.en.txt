for many years now I think Windows laptops that were built for Creative work have been in a really bad space you either have to pick up gaming laptops that were over the top or you'd have to pick up these underpowered devices that just weren't set up for the task and it just stemed from the fact that the tech did not exist to build a proper laptop that was aimed for creators but it's very different now we have new trips from Intel that I think fundamentally changes the way that this whole product
segment is okay so in front of me are two of the first ones I've seen this is lenovo's Yoga slim 7i and this is their yoga Pro 9i so I've partnered with Lenovo and Intel to give you guys an early look at these devices and who are also nice enough to sponsor this video so what makes these products so good for Creative work is that you finally have devices that have awesome screens really good performance excellent battery life and they're super quiet and they're thin and light like this is just the nature
of the yoga products but you could not get all those characteristics before in one product there always like pick two or three at most but now all five let's get into it so first the screens uh this is the yoga slim 7i and this is the screen on the yoga Pro 9i now both of these have phenomenal screen options even the less expensive slim models still get a super high quality panel that's bright with great color accuracy and my favorite thing about these two panels is their lack of a matte finish
so these are both fairly reflective screens but that means there's no kind of diffusion layer on top and I think for Creative devices it is really good when Brands offer screen options that are glossy now this device here is on just another level so this is a mini LED panel that's higher resolution and it's got the pure sight Pro branding and I measured this to have the widest color gamut on any laptop I've seen to date it has a higher Adobe RGB coverage than even MacBook Pros and it also has a very
low Delta this is a incredibly color accurate and color capable screen and also 165 HZ if you play games it's such a treat this is a very nice looking screen now the chips that are in here are the new Intel Core Ultra chips the one that's in here is the core Ultra 9 and on the slim product it's the core Ultra 7 and these are very capable chips but I want to highlight a few features that I think are particularly valuable so the first is the Energy Efficiency these are so much more energy efficient
than the previous generation like I cannot stress this enough the previous Intel product that was used in this product class like the creative laptops was so comically poor with Energy Efficiency that battery life was just I want to use the word atrocious you could not take these devices and work on stuff using the battery for very long this new generation is so much better than anything that Intel has ever offered before and secondly the gpus so these now have Intel's new arc gpus and
they're again so much better these literally double the graphic performance of the previous generation it's better for 3D work for photo Work video work even some vsts for music production can make use of hard Hardware acceleration in graphics and obviously if you play games on the side way better this generation than last but if you want the best possible GPU performance you got to pick up a pro product these have access to nvidia's RTX gpus the one here goes up to an RTX 470 uh the other thing I
want to mention Thunderbolt so right now I'm shooting this video before CES I have six videos that I'm working on concurrently that like if I was using regular USBC drives these can hold all the project files but I can't work on these things if you want to edit like a video with multiple camera angles off of one drive you just can't do it it would just bog down the system heavily so you'd have to like TR you'd have to run multiple drives or dump it onto the laptop it's it's a nightmare the
solution it's been around for years Thunderbolt this has super high bandwidth you put all six projects all different camera angles on one drive it can all be edited off of one drive if I go to a desktop I just bring this one drive and connect it up Thunderbolt can be super important if you want to work with kind of large media files uh okay the other thing I want to mention fan noise this is a this is a topic that's so near and dear to my heart ever since I started YouTube that's like one of the
things I've always tunnel visioned on how loud are these laptops when you're using them for work now when I got these things in I'm going to you know what this is the one I'm going to focus on this is this is the pro product so this is a more powerful CPU and a more powerful GPU than the other products but this system when I got it in I booted it up I was in Premiere and I was like why is this thing so quiet and then I loaded up a game I thought okay maybe games will push this thing this laptop is the
quietest laptop I've ever had in my600 hours of OverWatch this is full load 165 frames per second but 35 DB it's never been done before now I think there are a few factors at play here that allow these laptops to be so quiet the first is that these new Intel chips are just more energy efficient they produce less heat the fans don't have to run as hard but secondly when you pop these things open the fan modules have been upgraded from last year's devices but they also have these foam elements ments to direct
the air flow in a very particular way to maximize cooling but another reason is that some of the yoga laptops run lenovo's X power it's their Performance Tuning Tech and inside some of these laptops is a chip called the AI Core it's an in-house chip that's made by Lenovo it's separate from Intel's AI Endeavors and this chip monitors the CPU and GPU demands in real time and then adjusts the power Dynamic the thermodynamics actively so it gives you just the best performance while keeping
it super quiet I cannot stress this enough like in video where I'm excited about something like this it's hard to convey without just being like a child right it just didn't exist before you couldn't get a quiet laptop when you're playing games or doing video edits it just wasn't possible you always have to have headphones on because the fan noise is going you don't need that anymore you can just it's a quiet system while using the speakers and the speakers are actually pretty good dude there's six
speakers on the big one uh four on the slim it's just this it's a very different product category now just because of the tech that's available today there's one other AI based feature on these laptops that I think is interesting it's called The Creator Zone and it's basically an app for AI image generation so it can do sketch to image and text to image and for the Pro Models it can actually train image models locally using the Nvidia GPU so it going to be done offline now this tool is not
as powerful as something like a paid subscription to Mid Journey but it's included in these laptops and you also get two free months of Adobe Creative clouds you get access to photoshop and Premiere and after effects all of those apps it's the stuff that I use it's like a $100 savings right there but it's interesting to me and good to me that they're able to make something like this this is like a $900 product and to get the screen and the keyboard and the performance like these are just so much
better than what we had access to before for creatives like it's just this is awesome and honestly it's entirely made possible because of those new Intel chips they have to be completely Frank right that's the way it is okay uh there you have it the new yoga products
