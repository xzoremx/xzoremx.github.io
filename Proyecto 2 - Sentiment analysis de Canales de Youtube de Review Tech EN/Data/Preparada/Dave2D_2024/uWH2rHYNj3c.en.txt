ever since Apple came out with that first M1 laptop the entire Windows laptop space has been trying to play catchup on Energy Efficiency like at this point Windows devices have better screens they have better performance they have better pricing they have better gaming capabilities they have upgradable components there's so much stuff that's better when it comes to Windows devices but when it comes to Energy Efficiency Apple has the very clear lead and this is the metric that
Apple leans in on right even when they first launched the chip that was their whole thing performance per watt year on year it's like the thing that they lean on for their marketing material because it's really good now the reason why it's so important is because Energy Efficiency defines so much stuff when it comes to a laptop it defines like the form factor your battery life your heat output your how loud your fans are maybe you can even have a fanless system if it's energy efficient enough and one of
the main reasons why MacBooks have such good Energy Efficiency is because they use the arm architecture in their chips instead of the x86 architecture that the vast majority of Windows laptops use now very soon like in a matter of weeks we are going to be seeing a whole slew of laptops that contain a new chip from Qualcomm the arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and these laptops are supposed to be able to properly compete against Apple's MacBooks across the board now you might be thinking Dave arm-based
Windows laptops aren't anything new how do we know that this one won't suck like all the other ones of the past I wondered the same thing so uh in 2019 I did my first review of a arm-based Windows laptop the Surface Pro X and my review of that device was it was lukewarm at best you know what I can't even call lukewarm I said that thing sucked because they just had bad software support and even for apps that did run on it it just didn't have great performance the chip wasn't special
enough for people to be for people to buy it and because people weren't purchasing this thing I don't even think manufacturers were that interested in doing follow-ups of that device but this time it's really different because if you look at this new chip the Snapdragon Elite chip almost every major laptop company is going to be on board for this launch because the performance of this chip has caught their eye it seems to be really good in geekbench and cin bench now granted these are synthetic
benchmarks running native versions of those benchmarks so it's like best case scenario but very impressive numbers Apple does have their M3 Max but that's just a completely different class of Chip and also if you look at some of the GPU benchmarks it's quite impressive there is one thing to note here if you look at those benchmarks there's two variants that they showed a 23 watt version and then an 80 watt version an 80 watt TDP is fairly high for a laptop 23 to 30 is probably kind of like your
average thin and light 14inch device I am a little bit disappointed that they didn't showcase some kind of like 10 to 15 watt performance metric because if they had shown that that to me would have been like there's going to be a fanless version right CU I think on a fanless device you kind of need to keep it below 15 watts TDP I think in general we're going to be seeing devices that are much quieter compared to an Intel or an AMD system right now but still having awesome performance now the second thing
I want to talk about is software so all the benchmarks that you saw right there were done on apps that were built specifically for arm chips now right now in 2024 there's a decent amount of like first-party Microsoft apps that run natively on arm chips but the vast majority of thirdparty apps still do not have versions that are natively compiled for arm chips it's been like 4 years since I did my review on the original Surface Pro X and since that time I would have imagined there'd be way more
developers that have gone on board with this whole native arm stuff it's still fairly limited now it does make sense like from the perspective of developers unless there's an actual demand for this kind of stuff you're not going to put the resources in time that's required to maintain another version of your app but I do think that with this new hardware Snapdragon Elite it pushes customers towards it because it's attractive and consequently developers come with but for the apps that are still
x86 you still need to run emulation to be able to run it on these arm chips now back in 2019 because those chips weren't super powerful emulation was bad also the emulator only supported 32-bit apps at launch so that was also awful but now it's actually pretty decent it supports 64-bit apps and emulated performance is pretty close to Native but there is a noticeable reduction in Energy Efficiency when you run emulated apps and that's just the nature of real-time emulation Apple does handle their
emulation differently like technically it's not even emulation it's a translation layer so it actually creates this unoptimized but native arm code the first time we launch it so it's not as big of a performance hit the point I'm trying to make though is that Apple's Rosetta 2 is like it's going to be better than what Windows has in terms of the emulation SL transation however because of these chips being as powerful as they are I think they can just brute force it I think that you throw in an
x86 app on these new Snapdragon chips I think it just has the power to just push it out and be like it just works not as energy efficient but it'll work now qualcomm's also talked about gaming performance on these new Chips I have my reservations like the idea of emulated games on these systems the chip is good it's similar to like an RTX 3050 let's say in terms of just raw performance capabilities now qualcomm's telling developers that existing Games should just work but there's so much stuff that
goes wrong when you emulate games on across architectures like I I can't imagine it coming out smoothly at least that's what it's been like in the past so if there's any difference this time I'd be pleasantly surprised um okay last thing I want to talk about pricing and configuration so uh we've seen well these are these are arm chips and when it comes to arm chips you don't tend to not have removable Ram it's not like you just like swap out Ram modules kind of like MacBooks but also I think that
there won't be removable drives like I think that the drives will be baked onto these systems the same way that MacBooks are so you're going to be stuck with deciding and choosing your RAM configuration and storage configuration for the life of the product now because this is Windows I really don't think they're going to have like 8 gigabyte RAM options and 256 storage options like that to me I don't think Windows would allow that I really don't so I think they'll be like 16 and 512 at a minimum
but it's all baked on now the other thing is pricing in order for this product to matter I really think pricing is like absolutely critical because if everything lines up if they do have an awesome chip with awesome battery life with great emulation support like if it's super expensive none of this video matters this entire product is dead to me if the pricing is horrible because it's so competitive at this point yes nothing can match the power efficiency of apple and yes these
devices are theoretically the ones to be able to do it but if the pricing sucks there's just a million other really good options that people are going to pick instead of a super expensive arm-based Windows laptop I just hope that Qualcomm recognizes kind of the scenario they have at hand here it's awesome opportunity to make some real Headway in like Market space and just awareness of this type of product but please don't be super expensive that would suck um okay there you have it I really think these
Windows laptops will be I think they'll be cool I think they'll be the first time I've been interested in a Windows like an arm-based Windows laptop in four years it's been a while
