I need to preface this video with one note I've only used Apple Vision Pro once months ago at WWDC so a lot of the conversation I'm about to have stems from the more recent reviews and unboxings okay if I ask you to visualize Apple's Vision Pro in your mind just like picture it what are the features that materialize like what are the things that you remember the most about it I would say for most people the two big things are the solo knit band like the strap and then the screen on the
front where you can see the eyes of the user I feel like those two features are the most iconic features of the Apple Vision Pro and I have so many thoughts about these two things okay first let's start off with the straps so when I got to try it that was the strap that we used uh the solo knit band and it's the strap that you see in all the marketing material the website the commercials a lot of the reviews like the reviewers are using them that's the strap it's very cool looking and it's arguably the
most interesting strap we've ever seen from an AR or VR headset from any company the thing is it's not a particularly functional strap I mean this headset is over 600 G and from all the reports we've seen that single band is not particularly comfortable for extended wear the other strap that double band is where it's at it's significantly more comfortable I mean when Marquez first tried it this was his reaction in the back well that's so much more well distributed and I happen to
adjust it pretty close to my head that is going to be much easier to wear for longer but I think it's immediately a better fit it's more comfortable wow those are marquez's words and I think that was literally the first time he put it on his head now the problem with that second strap or the double strap version is that well there's a couple things one you now have a strap that runs over your head and it can squash certain hairstyles down but two it just doesn't look nearly as cool it the actual strap
system looks super plain and just it's not a particularly Apple looking strap system now if you look at any headset before like this is the meta Quest 3 it's a super lame strap system it's nothing special to even look at those double straps are boring and if you're apple and you're launching a new product category it has to look awesome and it's not just the product the people using it also have to look awesome in your commercials you can't have people with flattened hair it's got to look like
something that's never been done before never been seen before and that is what the solo knit band does really well I can only imagine the number of iterations that they tried to like retool and rebuild that single strap system to make make it actually viable for long-term wear but you can't beat physics right single strap from what we've seen it's comfortable for like 30 maybe 40 minutes and then you get fatigue on the head because it's got to clamp so tight and it's just the
distribution of that weight is not ideal on a single strap it's enough time to kind of demo the product or just play with it but if you're going to use that "$3,500 machine for the spatial Computing" experience that Apple's trying to pitch here Comfort is super important and the way to get Comfort is that ugly ass double strap system that flattens your hair and that is why Apple includes that double Loop band right in the Box it's not some optional accessory that you have to buy I mean they would love to
sell your accessories that's what Apple does but in this case I think they recognize that in terms of actual usability of this device you do need the double strap system but that single Loop that uh solo knit band it's a beautiful marketing tool now the other thing I want to talk about is the screen and I think this is the second most iconic feature of Apple Vision Pro that front-facing screen looks really cool now I said in my initial impressions of the Vision Pro that I felt like that
front-facing screen was not good in the sense that it added weight it adds cost it makes it more fragile it goes through batteries quicker I still stand by all of that because this product the Apple Vision Pro when the the user who's using it they're not getting anything out of that front screen it's entirely for the other people that might be interacting with you like if someone comes in the room they want to have an interaction with you it's a more natural interaction action with someone when you can see
their eyes and that's primarily the main benefit of it all but when you look at the product right now when you see the eyes like they don't look particularly good at least not to me uh I do think that there's room for improvement in terms of how they're capturing that image and stuff but you also rarely see the user's eyes it's often that purple swirly Haze that indicates that the person is busy using the device so I look at these two features these iconic features the solo knit band and the the
purple swirly front screen it's like these are very neat looking things but both of these features or characteristics they're often not even going to be used by people who purchase Vision Pro like it's it's strange that the two most iconic features of this product are things that aren't even part of the main user experience for the users and so I thought okay Apple must be highly aware of this right they built this thing over the course of years so why is this even in here and I thought
and thought okay I imagined an alternative product like Imagine The Vision Pro didn't have that super cool solo knit band and it didn't have the front screen it was just like a very plain Vision Pro like developers kit now I imagine that product would be cheaper than the current Vision Pro and it could have better battery life because there's no screen uh it might be more comfortable cuz it's lighter and it's got the double strap system but that product would look just like every other
headset out there it would not be something Apple could Market it would it just wouldn't be a product they would sell despite it being arguably a better first generation product for more people right but that would be an unsellable unmarketable product for apple and when I realized that I think I see what they're actually doing with Vision Pro so obviously there's a cold conversation of like this is a first gen product and they're trying to get this out to the public into people's hands and so the
developers can build it so the ecosystem can grow sure but there's another part of it I think what they're doing with this product is that they're making headsets socially acceptable and the way they do it is by making these Ultra iconic Ultra memorable visual components of this thing so that when you see it on the street you recognize you're like okay that's Apple's Vision Pro so here let's hear me out here okay if you think about Apple as a company right now I would say that they're not
innovators right now they haven't been for years in the sense that they don't or they haven't in years come out with a product that is completely brand new that no one else has ever done what they're good at what they're arguably the best at is taking a product that other companies have done or tried but they take it they tweak it and tune it and then package it into a form factor that's very usable and also very desirable for the normal consumer and that is Apple's superpower so if you
think back to the airpods before Apple's airpods came out there were lots of companies that were making wireless earbuds but they were never popular but then Apple made their airpods like obviously they killed the headphone jack and everyone else did the same but ever since they launched those Q-tip things like right from the rib people are like that looks so stupid those actually look like Q-tips sticking out of your ear but look where we are now we're in a world where the Q-tips are not just socially
accepted but they're desirable amongst a lot of young kids and it's like that is what apple is really good at and also the Apple watch if you think about smart watches before Apple watch came out there were tons of companies making smart watches but it was like socially cringy to wear a smart watch can you imagine going on a date in like 2010 and be like hey I'm going to put on my SmartWatch and go out and to meet this person no way you'd be you'd have to be really confident in yourself to do that
but now smart watches are everywhere and they are again socially accepted and in some places socially desirable and I think the way they did again they did it through like a design right this is a squared face everyone was making round SmartWatches they went Square because they wanted to do the appway and I think they're doing the exact same thing with the Vision Pro but they had to make it distinctly different from everybody else's headset and they had to make it look cool because that is I think the
ultimate goal of this first iteration of Vision Pro because even if it's an amazing piece of Hardware which it is but if it didn't look cool if it wasn't desirable Apple like that's just not the apple way so I think I ultimately think that this product Vision Pro or just whatever this product category evolves into I think it will be a success for them I think it's just like a it's the same kind of trajectory they've had with all of their products that trajectory of success where it comes out and the key
in the is not to make it the best product it might be but that's not the most important thing for them it's to make it socially acceptable and socially desirable so that now like right now if you saw someone wearing like a meta Quest 3 on the head on like an airplane it be like what is this guy doing right but I think in a few years time I think there will be headsets on air on flights I think people will be wearing Vision pros and other headsets and I think a lot of it will have stemmed from the
existence of Apple's Vision Pro and the way that they marketed the whole thing with like really iconic design language and stuff but there you have it those are some of my thoughts on Vision Pro
