all right you guys are in for a treat these are the new Asus R zephrus G14 and g16 the small one and then a big one and the moment I can get the g16 in this Platinum white color the platinum silver color I'm switching this is going to be the device I'm going to be using so when I pulled these things out of the box I thought these are barely even recognizable as G14 and g16 like this is so different from the original product and so much more refined and elegant I was like this doesn't even look like a
gaming laptop it's so clean so this device is in the Platinum white color way and then below here is the eclipse gray color way and The Branding is so subtle it's just lasered out on the corner here there's no more holographic badges like they've had in the past uh and then there's also this diagonal slash that runs through the devices this thing is I love it I love everything about it so it's like this reflective metal and if you get up close to it you'll notice that there's a series of
slits that run along the length of this design accent and these light up there's a series of white LEDs underneath those slits and they shine through and it looks so cool the gray color already looks really nice but then the white sucker for white colored laptops so this is just it's on another level all right so the chassis on these devices so this is like an aluminum top panel but the chassis is also aluminum but this is milled out from one block that's very uncommon when it comes to gaming laptops
the razor blades are made like that and it usually jacks up the production cost of these types of products but it's a single block of metal like gets machined out to make a very clean looking keyboard deck uh so we'll come back to this in a second I want to talk about the displays so both of these displays use OLED panels so they have OLED options this one is the 16in this one here is the 14in now OLED when it comes to gaming panels it's a it's a debate that's been going on for a while I
personally think that OLED screens are the best panels you can possibly get for gaming content cre creation is a separate question but when it comes to just straight up gaming I love OLED it's got so many advantages it's got awesome colors fantastic contrast ratios because the black pixels are just straight up black but OLED panels do run the risk of having shorter lifespans because of OLED burning now on regular laptops like a productivity focused laptop I don't think OLED burning is a big issue
because like you're not staring at the same thing for eight hours unchanging at Max brightness but on gaming laptops it is a risk right you're often in game for hours with unchanging UI elements like your health bar bar or like a mini map that just doesn't change for the entire duration of your gaming session and you're often at really high brightness those are the types of things that can cause burning on a traditional OLED panel but I asked Asus about theirs they stated that they have a lot of
engineering time that's gone into these panels to prevent that kind of stuff they also have a screen saver that's like a pixel refreshing screen saver as well as some software tweaks that they recommend to preserve the health of these screens so hopefully it holds up because these are very nice screens now one thing I noticed on these panels actually it's with every OLED panel I've ever seen on a laptop the color accuracy and color gamut tends to shift the moment you play around with brightness
right so if you really care about having color accurate workspaces I would lean toward like a regular IPS panel over the OLED technology that's on these uh but again they do offer these devices with regular like non OLED screens okay the keyboard I've grown used to this keyboard I've used it so much the one thing I dislike there's no print screen complain about it every years it's like four years now that I've been talking about this I don't know why there's still no print screen I use it all the
time it's not the same as window shift s there's multiple applications out there that require a print screen you have to like rebind it it's great keyboard other than the lack of the print screen this trackpad is massive it's as big as you could possibly make it on this device right arguably too big because if I don't disable this trackpad before playing games sometimes I'll get some misclicks from my palm uh so the keyboard also lights up RGB lighting like you'd expect but on the left and
right are some speakers and these speakers sound awesome like so much better than I would ever expected from a Windows gaming laptop so both the 16-in and the 14in have six speakers in them there's two that are in like this lower area there like a force cancelling set of them and then there's a tweeter that fires out the left and right uh speaker Grill now if you've seen any of my videos before I often rip on Windows laptops just having terrible speakers it's never made sense
to me that they often suck these are way better and actually sound pretty close to what the MacBook Pros can put out in terms of audio quality okay let's talk about performance so these two products the uh G14 and g16 run two different chips this product here is running the 8000 series AMD chips these are running the new meteor Lake chips from Intel the core Ultra products both of these are very capable chips but they're not going to be as powerful as the top-of-the-line Intel chips but the thing to keep in
mind is that on the RG zephyr's products these have always been about thin and light performance and it's so much better that Intel finally has a lower wattage but still high performance chip that can fit in here and power these systems very well while equipping it with high-end Nvidia GPU so the G14 can go up to an RTX 470 the g16 can go up to an RTX 490 now obviously not at full wattage these are thinner systems but there're still very powerful gaming laptops thermal performance and fan
noise are already very good but because these are engineering samples they could actually get better at the retail launch uh battery life does have a pretty big battery 90 W hours the 14in has a 73 W hour battery but neither of these devices have replaceable Ram only the storage can be swapped out now in terms of charging it there's a new AC adapter plug for these devices and this is it here it's a proprietary adapter it is reversible so you can plug it right side up upside down but I think that since
the bigger higher wat systems are 240 Watts at Max and the smaller one is 180 Watts you could have done this with USBC there is USBC power delivery 3.1 that can pump out 240 WTS I imagine the AC adapter for that thing would be very expensive compared to this right to be able to handle the right voltage it would have been more expensive but who wants a proprietary adapter another USC Port would have been awesome okay quick note about the ports uh there's two USPA two USC so that's the
right side this is the left side uh so they also have HDMI and headphone jack on the left side but there is a couple differences because the bigger product is running the Intel chip this has Thunderbolt 4 so if you have Thunderbolt perals you need that in your workflow this one can do it the a the AMD product can't do it uh the other thing is the SD card slot so on the big one you have fulls sizee SD and on the little one you have only micro SD but there you have it G14 g16 these are so nice what do you
think aren't these things awesome aren't these the best looking laptops you've ever laid your eyes on I mean come  on
