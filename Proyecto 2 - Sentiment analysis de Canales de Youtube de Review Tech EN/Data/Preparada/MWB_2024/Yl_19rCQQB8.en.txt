these are the iPhone 16s and this should be a huge year for battery improvements Apple said that the iPhone 16 and 16 plus should have a big boost yes that was the official term they used but then also that the iPhone 16 Pro Max should have the best battery life ever on an iPhone so let's find out if they were telling the truth and just how long we're talking about here so this is the "$1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max the $999 16 Pro" the $899 16 plus and then the $799 iPhone 16 and we're doing something
different this year we're comparing these new phones to two iPhones from last year the top end iPhone 15 Pro Max and the base iPhone 15 but also Samsung to see where Apple sits against the competition so this is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra which is the best phone that Samsung makes okay let's unplug the test begins now and since I wanted to base this test off a typical days usage let's begin with a workout app that I've just started using so the big question how has Apple achieved this supposed Big
Boost in battery this year well two things the first is they've apparently added bigger batteries to all iPhone 16s which sounds like the most obvious thing I've ever said but you would be amazed how resistant phone companies are to doing this I would guess because Apple knows how much people want bigger batteries combined with how a bigger battery is one of the easiest ways to upgrade a phone that they specifically save these battery improvements for years where there's not much else going
on kind of like a Band-Aid always ready to slap in and fix a slower year of changes okay so that's an hour of workout and oh the base iPhone 16 is currently leading the pack that seems like a strange result but I'm not worried I've done enough of these battery test to know that the software of a phone will sometimes tell you it's on one percentage even when the battery itself is actually on something quite different the one thing that can't lie is the final result how long till the
phone completely dies so let's jump into some work now this is slack this is the messaging app that our team uses so I have bravely asked them all to say something funny for the next hour and I did want to add that there's another reason that I think phone companies have resisted battery improvements over the years is that they don't just want you to buy one phone they want you to keep upgrading phones and so I imagine a big part of why they're so stingy with battery is it would hurt their
businesses if they gave you too much like imagine if one year Apple doubled the battery life on their iPhones I would bet everything I have that 3 to 4 years after that around the time where the people who bought that phone would normally start upgrading to the next thing significantly less would do so because batteries degrading over time is one of the primary incentives to upgrade but if you start with more battery than you need then you don't care even when it degrades time for Instagram let's do
some planned spontaneous Dooms growling so yeah the last time that Apple properly upgraded the batteries on their phones was between the iPhone 12s and the iPhone 13s and even though that wasn't a massive year of other changes battery is so important that I would say that one change alone made the iPhone 13 stand out as a good time to upgrade my point being that even though the iPhone 16s feel like a smaller more incremental update to the iPhone 15s if the battery improvements are actually big then that
alone would be enough to put them on the map so there's a lot resting on this and so is it working for them well you can see that the normal iPhone 16's battery has fallen back in line it's still doing really well but just now at a sensible believable level Samsung is the one who's taken the lead which man would it not be such a smooth move if on a table of six iPhones though one Samsung is the one that takes the win oh can you see by the way that the iPhone 15 screen has
gone super dim well that actually ties perfectly into the second reason for the Apparently improved battery life this year the first is the larger battery which we've talked about but the second is the new chips in these phones see the iPhone 16 and 16 plus are running Apple's new a18 chipset and the 16 Pro and proax are running the new a18 Pro I won't get too technical here but basically these chips are designed using a new process that manages to get the transistors closer together the
transistors are kind of like the building blocks of the chip so if they're packed in even closer together it reduces the communication distance making them faster making them more energy efficient which is the thing that's good for battery but also less hot and that is a key part of why the iPhone 15's display is dimmed and the new phones haven't yet and this Improvement to the chipset should actually be a particularly big jump for the base iPhone 16 and 16 plus because those phones have actually jumped
forward two generations before Apple would only let the pro phones have the latest tech and so the normal iPhone 15 is using a chip from 2 years ago even even though it's last year's phone but this year it's simple every new iPhone gets a new a18 generation of chips I guess because all iPhones need to run Apple intelligence and apple intelligence requires this new hardware that said after 4 hours now that we're jumping into YouTube is it looking like as big of a claim as Apple was making it
seem well so far the new iPhones are outpacing their last generation counterparts the iPhone 16 is doing better than the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 16 Pro Max is doing better than the iPhone 15 Pro Max but they're also they're not exactly crushing them it's really Samsung who seems to be running away with this test now bear in mind this Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra I've never actually tested in one of these battery videos before but I have used it as my main phone for a while and I have been
blown away by battery life so if Samsung wins this it doesn't mean that the new iPhones have poor battery but it also wouldn't reflect great on Apple since battery is meant to be one of the big new things here also just so you know we've taken a lot of precautions to make this t as Fair as possible all phones are on their latest non beta updates so that means every iPhone is on iOS 18 and the Samsung is on Android 14 we' bought new versions of each phone so nothing here has had more than five charging
cycles and their battery is 100% healthy the room temperature is controlled at 18Â° C because that's been the average of indoor and outdoor temps for us they're all on light mode their settings are calibrated their screen brightness is matched they will look very slightly different to you because of natural variances in panels and also are the viewing angle from the camera but they are matched my point being that there are things that you can't factor in with a test like this like no phone has a SIM
card in because that would introduce a whole new tier of variables but at the same time this should give you as accurate a representation as you can get of how all of these phones perform relative to each other we're on the cameras now by the way and this is probably the most demanding thing that any normal person does on a day-to-day basis because recording 4K video pushes just about every single component in your phone to the max all at once so this is where you expect overheating and
rapid battery drain but oh boy I'm actually particularly impressed with this Samsung and it shows that serious work has been done somewhere here the "Galaxy s24 Ultra has a 5,000 mAh battery" and you might know that Samsung's had "5,000 Mah batteries for ages on their" Flagship phones but they never used to be this good there was a time not that long ago where iPhones that had less "than 4,000 mahs were destroying Samsungs" "that had 5,000 the iPhones were just" getting far more juice per milliamp hour
but that looks like it's flipped now Apple doesn't disclose precise Milli measurements but the estimate for the battery size on this 16 Pro Max is "around 4,700 which if true means that" this phone has 95% of the capacity of the Samsung but it seems like it's lasting less than 95% as long so its juice per milliamp hour if that term isn't taken I'm coining it is looking lower for the first time ever the side note isn't it actually kind of mesmerizing watching chat gbt write out
"7 20,000 word essays at the same time" what a wild time to be alive now as for why this Samsung is doing so good I've been thinking about this I thought it could be a Samsung specific thing but that wouldn't be my first guess as I've noticed Android flagships in general lasting a lot longer this year it could be related to the new Snapdragon chip that most top-end Androids are being powered by and maybe that's a factor but that can't be the main thing because my new Google pixels battery is also really
surprisingly good and that doesn't use a Snapdragon then I realized the Common Thread it's Android 14 every phone I've tested that has surpris me with how good the battery is has been running Android 14 which has fixed basically a loophole that allows apps to consistently run in the background if they decide they want to and based on how much of an improvement this software seems to have made that loophole might well have been the thorn in Android side that's now been removed and well it changes the
entire landscape so the iPhone 15 is down and out after 7 hours and 45 minutes just before we're about to enter some heavier gaming and oh look the iPhone 16 has just started dimming too it's good to see that the pro iPhones and the Samsung are not dimming cuz you know you would expect that Pro phones are designed to be able to take more stress oh no I'm wrong the pro has just started dimming now too iPhones sometimes do this just before they die but the fact that I can't turn the
brightness back up does mean that this is a thermal issue well that's disappointing pointing and now both phones are out in the exact same minute but from this point now that it's just the big Bo left let's just get to it let's fast forward this test all the way to the Finish now it's brutal seemingly unending finish right into the late evening which is when the editing starts and I'm going to do something a little extra this time around as soon as we've gone through the battery drain results
I'm also going to while the phones are here quickly stick them on charge so we can see how fast they go the other way so as you've seen in seventh place was the iPhone 15 with 7 hours and 45 not an amazing result but still I would say sufficient battery for most medium users then there was a pretty large gap before the 16 died which is good based on the intensity of this test 8 hours 19 is a sign that I still wouldn't recommend the 16 to the absolute heaviest users but you've got more than enough as long as
you're not one of them and then completely neck and neck with the 16 is the 16 Pro and I'm kind of both glad that Apple has managed to make a compact phone with actually great battery life now while also feeling a little disappointed that they didn't manage to make the pro last well even a minute longer than the base iPhone isn't battery life like the single feature that power users are going to need more of than basic users and then another large gap later the iPhone 16 plus
called it at 8 hours and 45 minutes this is great battery there is no doubt about it but it's also not as great as I expected I actually assumed that this plus would Outlast the base 16 by at least an hour and so the fact that its lead has ended up as just 26 minutes means battery isn't really a massive factor in going for the plus this generation the iPhone 15 Pro Max has top end battery life this one I expected to last a long time and it absolutely did with 9 hours and 35 which I think is
down to the extra efficiencies from the promotion display that can both scale up the refresh rate when you want things super smooth but also scale down to really low refresh rates when your apps just don't need it so in apps where it can scale back it will save you a lot of battery in second place then the iPhone 16 Pro Max does indeed improve upon the 15 Pro Max's already Stellar battery life with 11 hours and 22 minutes which fair play that's pretty amazing but not amazing enough the Samsung actually did
just go and do it it beat every iPhone and while this isn't the longest battery life reading I've ever recorded it's worth bearing in mind that every time we do this test you shouldn't expect the same results and you can't compare between them because I'm always updating the app list and so if we look at how well Samsung has performed compared to the phones in this test then it's far enough ahead of supposedly the best iPhone battery life ever that I think this is the best battery on any phone
that has been put through our tests and now that all the phones are fully drained this is our perfect opportunity to see how fast they can all charge so I've got each phone connected to the exact same 65 W plug that I got off Amazon which since these companies don't send you their recommended charges anymore I feel like is the best plug that most people might realistically have lying around and while that happens I want to show you something pretty cool that you can do thanks to the Opera
browser this vid sponsor I am consistently surprised at how intelligent the bakedin Arya AI actually is like check this out command plus slash to bring it up on top of whatever you're doing what's the battery life difference between an iPhone 15 Pro and an iPhone 15 Pro Max I mean the thing literally draws a table to present the information in a clearer way that's actually crazy but it gets better because Arya now has both image recognition an image generation so like I mean let's try this make me a
wallpaper for my phone that's pretty but also has a lot of black in it to save battery that I can download and apply okay that's cool it's by far the best browser for organization thanks to tab Islands but also functionality thanks to being able to have your tabs all the way across the top and then your apps all the way down the side link below to download the Opera browser for free so after about 10 minutes of charging these are the percentages 22% 22% 22% 21% % wo so basically every iPhone 16 has the
same charging speed we got 19% on the 15 Pro Max and then 22 again so the pro Max iPhone last year was a tiny bit slower 17 bear in mind this phone can charge a little faster if you specifically use Samsung's own 45 W power bricking cable but that's not cheap so if you're using something more generic then it seems like iPhone is likely to charge faster catch you in the next one
