this is an exploding fire extinguisher and here's why you might want one there's a polystyrene shell on the outside but on the inside an explosive combined with a whole heap of dry fire extinguishing powder yes I said explosive cuz as soon as I throw this into that fire the explosive is going to trigger blasting that powder in up to a 60t radius the main advantages being that one you can just place these in high-risk environments and know that they will extinguish any fires before
you even know about them and then two you don't even need to go near the fire you just Chuck it in and you wait for the action oh God it's happening wao my God subscribe for more explosive revolutions
