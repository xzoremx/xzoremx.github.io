"I'm about to spend $4,000 in the next 7" Minutes buying the most useless looking Tech on the internet to find out if it really is as stupid as it looks or if there's actually hidden genius lying within useless Tech earphones with a screen on them surely you just use your phone or would you someone's actually made an iPhone case that runs Android who is this for to be fair I'd use this but then I'm one of like the five weirdos who actually does carry around two phones world's most reol uary phone
case okay I'm interested it's $120 for a case that barely exists but a lot of people are saying good things about it Ching was that a good basket sound yeah thank you Ching please don't put that in the edit the lick day airpods strap are we actually living in a world where someone's selling a wire for your wireless earphones and it has 3 and 1 "12,000 reviews all right lick day I lick" the sound of you Que headphones ah I remember you the Dyson Zone headphone and face mask it's just
such a strange product that I can only assume exists for the sole purpose of getting people to talk about Dyson okay let's try useless computer tech I wonder if these companies know that they're paying for ads to come up when people type in useless tech oh no Center cam I just realized what this is so someone's built a webcam to sit in the middle of your your screen so that you can have direct eye contact with whoever you're calling this just feels like the most ridiculous form of over engineering to
fix a problem that no one really has oh we can either get the camera or we can get the deluxe package which includes a lens privacy cover then you can cover up your very poor purchase decisions but all that said I am actually curious now stupid gadgets okay Yep this is what we came for someone's built a smart egg minder that lets you know when you're low on eggs or you know you could just check the eggs before you go shopping like you will have to do for every single one of your other products anyway
oh there really are some not very clever products on the internet what's this the happy fork the happy fork is a bluetooth enabled smart fork that vibrates when it senses you're eating too fast This falls spoton in the category of I'm pretty sure it's dumb but it might just work the Air Neo selfie pocket drone okay so just so I understand this is a drone designed to take your selfies there's just no way that this situation exists in real life can you imagine you're just snuggled on the couch sorry babe just
wait a sec let me go grab my drone to capture this moment but you know what this is the video where we find out for sure so if I were to truly try and embody the useless lifestyle through and through what products would I surround myself with well of course there's such thing as a gaming bed and it has RGB like lighting further immerse yourself into that in-game experience and away from your spouse would I be lying if I said there wasn't 10% of me that really wanted one of these it's definitely more
than 10 although speaking of beds the Sleep bar turns your pillow into an earphone the most comfortable way to listen won't disturb your partner in bed I'm very curious how this measures up to just using your phone or laptop speaker oh Etsy of course useless Tech wao W someone's taken apart a hard drive and turned it into a clock the IAC home so this is apparently the most convenient way to clean it's a stationary vacuum cleaner it says no more bending over with a dust pan but then what about a
normal vacuum cleaner it's got a weird alien drop pod sci-fi kind of vibe to it though which I kind of dig oh we also need some useless clothing someone's designed a jacket with an air conditioning unit inside I'm just racking my brain trying to imagine the situation of oh I'm really hot right now let me put on my jacket a leather designer belt that's also a power bank you'll always have it with you belt buckles are kind of thick anyway I'm somewhat interested cuff links that are
also working clogs well okay as long as you remember to bring your microscope every time you go out the zip tie bracelet oops now it's on forever this thing looks interesting well on one hand it actually looks a lot like those $20 wish.com sound sound bars but then on the other hand it's very much that retro future vibe that screams to the gamer in me but what exactly is it it basically just tells you it's got five displays and they're customizable but not really what that means all right fine useless
form of Transport the moon Walkers are the first ever Mobility device that allows you to walk at the speed of a run don't know why they're showing people climbing upstairs though cuz that's one place you really shouldn't be trying to run I mean let's say you spend an hour per day walking around this could cut that down to 20 minutes and then finally I want to get some stuff for the kitchen these always end up being the most fun sections I think I found a place that makes custom toasters with whatever
image you give to them okay so you upload an image and then it's $150 for one toaster or $700 for 10 toasters if you want to feed your entire town your face oh actually why don't we just look on Tik Tok huh POV you bring the cocktail lounge home with you so you put your cocktail capsule of choice in and then it turns that into that cocktail designed with your strength preferences in mind oh wow and it's super well reviewed "5,163 ratings so let's investigate a" someone's made a smart foret let me ask
you this what hasn't someone tried to make smart an unmatched touchless experience kind of like my dating history there's a spoon here that claims to elevate the taste of your food it says the built-in iron sensory technology mildly excites The Taste Birds on your tongue we'll be able to find out pretty quickly for ourselves whether it's bogus or not the ice designer tray looks like it engraves patterns into your ice cubes it's definitely one of those never occurred to me to want products but now that I
see those results I am curious the Thirsty Goose the stylish solution for men's urinary needs oh this is like one of those bedside toilet things get the job done and go back to sleep do you like winning stay in the zone with the Thirsty Goose urinal it's actually a Premium electroplated Gold beak that's yeah everything's just arrived and this is probably going to be the most interesting video in this ibought series ever for me cuz I have genuinely no idea if these products are
going to be atrocious or amazing so let's find out from the cheapest all the way to the most expensive starting at $10 for those who decided they wanted to pay3 times as much money to buy wireless earphones instead of wired earphones and then decided they wanted to wire up those wireless earphones to make them wired earphones the airpods wire so each one of these ends has a rather squishy circular hole place the airpod inside the hole and oh that's not going anywhere and so okay let's say I've got
my earphones in and I'm shaking my head and I H I feel like the problem is at the point where one of your earphones is already flying out your ear it's going to be traveling with so much momentum that it can most likely just pull the other one with it now I think of it are you more likely to lose both of your earphones using this here's the thing though if these actually did properly secure into your ears then I don't think the idea of wiring up your wireless earphones is actually such a crazy idea
because let's say you're an iPhone user it's not unreasonable that you might want Apple earphones because they pair really well but then let's say you want the best Apple earphones those aren't wired Apple only makes good wireless earphones so you have to get the airpods and then if you're doing a lot of running with them you have to get some sort of way of securing them it's just that this doesn't even really properly do that job so 2 out of 10 on the actually useful scale now for a product
that on a very personal level I'm excited for the spoon that makes your food taste better yesh well let's hope the product is better designed than the packaging I it does all sound a little bit science fiction this thing supposedly enhances the flavor of the food improves your aftertastes by exciting your tongue with mild electr stimulation okay yogurt me that could have gone worse so your finger needs to be covering the contact strip at the back your food needs to cover the emitter on the front and then
as soon as you've done that apparently when my lips touch this food it's going to complete some sort of circuit and  technology the light does come on interesting I was completely convinced this was going to be bogus but why did that actually taste nice this is my yogurt connoisseur era I think it might actually just be really nice yogurt I signed up to review Tech not yogurt okay maybe we do it VI ratings  spoon8 out of 10 spoon  Tech 8 out of 10 so what I'm imagining
is happening here is as soon as my lips touch that spoon it is completing some sort of circuit that lights up an LED on the inside and that's all it does oh yeah look you don't need food or your mouth to activate the technology but we should try this with more Foods throughout the video and then when we're done we could actually just take it apart and see for ourselves and while we're in the kitchen there's no point lying about it I'm a bit of a sucker for a fruity pink cocktail daddy
chill anytime I make something a dinner a drink a YouTube video I always like to make sure that it's presented well and so that part of my brain really gravitates towards this idea of this Ice Cube designer tray but then the rational part of my brain is thinking yes Aon $40 and 10 minutes of time to carve a pattern into an already melting Ice Cube to make one drink look 5% nicer for 60 seconds not your best purchase so let's  out okay so Ice Cube goes onto here and then oh my God wait that was like that
was like three seconds okay wait so now I use this one I did not expect the pace of this thing and not going to lie it's really cool how it works too it's no electronics it's just aluminium that quickly conducts heat from the air and transfers it to the Ice Cube so that the bits that touch the ice melt the ice I'm just so impressed at how something so manual is still able to work so efficiently and then to think you could have like 12 ice cubes going all at the same time so this is actually what
barbecues look like in the UK I was definitely expecting this to be one of those expectation versus reality products but question is though how long does the pattern last when you put it into a drink so it's been about 2 minutes and I'd say it's mostly gone at this point but this was a room temperature drink if you put it into an already refrigerator drink probably get five out of it but you know what not pointless at all that's a 9 out of 10 so you remember the spoon Tech it was an
interesting idea but I feel like for more of us the problem is not that food needs to taste better it's that it already tastes a little too good and that is what the happy fork is designed for and while on one hand it does seem abolutely ridiculous to let a fork decide when you're full or not as opposed to just you know knowing yourself there's one thing that makes me think it has a chance it's that while of course we do know very well ourselves when we've had enough it's pretty widely
documented that there is a 20 minute delay between us actually having eaten enough and our body communicating to our brain that we've eaten enough so that's 20 minutes within which you might well be eating way more than your body needs so happy fork which is now aggressively vibrating to tell me that it's on is designed to help you slow down by measuring all sorts of things like how often the fork touches your mouth how long it spends in your mouth it's all very intimate stuff but the idea is that
it will figure out if you're eating too fast and it will alert you okay so first sign of poor product design there's a blinking LED light to tell you that the fork is active you can barely see it so I think I'm just going to try and specifically eat quickly now to see if  triggers okay it buzzed four bites in so I guess that a very basic level it does what it says it's doing that was a lot of chickpeas that's a bit spicy so what if I eat at my normal speed I'm a little bit scared of being judged 
here so I can buite feel like I need to evaluate my entire life so what I'm curious about is what metrics is this using to decide what counts as a mouthful of food and can you trick it so what if I just go empty okay second bite it buzzes what if I don't even touch my mouth okay that does nothing so it seems like this actually works in a very similar way to the spoon Tech this entire handle is basically one metal contact point and then this becomes the other and to complete the circuit it has to go inside
your mouth I guess this is the technological way of achieving the same thing yum the spice is really building kind of wish I was back doing the yogurt now so product does actually work and the way the product works is actually pretty foolproof like as long as you're not trying to trick it I'd say it does deliver on its premise pretty well only thing is it was meant to be a mobile app which let you upload and track the data from it but since I guess this didn't sell the billions that the
found as we hoping the app no longer exists so you lose half of the functionality still a seven $120 $120 is what we just spent on this phone case let's be honest not really even a phone case my hypothesis is that it's going to be worse but maybe just maybe they figured out something here that the others haven't so I will give them this it might look like your unhinged child has just melted some toy plastic jewelry over the back of your phone but in person this actually feels very high
quality this is Aerospace grade aluminium on the outside for high structural strength and then on the inside is a rubbery elastomer that's designed to spread the impact away from the point of contact but does it work so let's find out starting now oh good technically though the phone is absolutely fine you can see where the case has taken a bit of a hit but the phone is exactly as it was do you know what this is really growing in my rankings because it really does feel like you're just using your
phone naked in terms of the weight the thickness and also the fact that you are for the most part directly touching your real phone's body so that was drop one which shows that the case can protect your phone if you have a bit of a fumble and it falls out of pocket height drop two though is where we actively try and damage it okay 3 2 1 oh it's looking pretty good okay that is yet again a completely unmarked iPhone now for test three the uneven surface this is where I imagine it is going to
break but if it survives then I would go as far as to say good product given how many benefits there are to the way it feels and also things like reduced 5G interference and better heat dissipation these cobbled floors scare me but I think we're just going to have to yink it in three 2 one let's find out okay Moment of Truth and we are absolutely fine o decent chunk of damage in that top corner I got to say though I was very resistant about this product but every time I've interacted with it it's improved
slightly in my rankings the center screen webcam though has really got its work cut out for me if it wants to impress me cuz well I mean it's not even necessarily because the idea is dumb but more because of the existence of AI I'll explain I'd say the camera is decently specked it's got a 1080p resolution and an F 2.1 aperture which should let in a reasonable amount of light but the thing I'm most curious about is is the quality going to be significantly better than a normal webcam because it's taking up
about eight times the depth okay so you clamp the peg on top of your laptop oh my God this looks ridiculous usba need an adapter USB port in there because I also got the deluxe package you get a light which now can't go in the center of your screen oh again with the cables though I imagine it's been designed to accommodate big desktop PCS but it just means that for a laptop user this is not a good look hello can you hear me yeah wow yes I can okay one second so I've got a little lighting fixture over here
that comes with it how do I look it's better than not having it so what's the quality like on your end well the quality is not good it's purple uh it's dark it's a uh just cut out as well wait this is so embarrassing oh there there you go okay so so the question is yeah so am I making direct eye contact with you if I kind of oh actually no so I sped the way the way I meant to do it is Bend this camera so it's over your face and now now it's sideways but if uh if I was sideways
this would that's yeah sure you can say that's I yeah so actually yeah the only way to get eye contact with this call is to cover the person you're calling so you're probably not seeing part of my face but at least it looks to me like you're looking at me yeah so I'm trying I'm trying to think who is this product for it's like it's for someone who absolutely obsesses over making eye contact with someone else who's already not making eye contact with you have you seen U Microsoft's fake eye contact yes
yeah and nvidia's done it too and that's kind of what's on my mind like when something like that that exists and then you look at the hardware equivalent way of achieving it it doesn't really make any sense $150 is where we're at now and that my friends is a hell of a lot of money to spend on a Bluetooth speaker also it's absolutely miniature it's not a convincing start the thing feels empty but I'm curious cuz you might know that I've gotten into the Habit recently of
watching a little bit of TV on my laptop as I'm falling asleep I don't know how it happened but as soon as my body hears an American sitcom it just starts shutting down so at this point I'm just not questioning it point is I am the target market for this I'm just I'm not convinced how this is going to be any better than listening on laptop speakers so it works using bone conduction which means that unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker which evenly spreads out the vibration in like 180° this concentrates
those vibrations within your skull and so that would explain how they've apparently made it so that only you can hear what's coming out of this and not the person sleeping next to you so this is approximately what my sleep setup looks like got a laptop on the side where I'm watching my show my pillow where I put my head and the duska is going to go beneath that right let's take this thing for a spin I don't actually fall asleep to my own videos this is for copyright purposes oh
interesting so when you play the speaker and you're just holding it out like this it sounds bad it sounds extremely tiny but putting it under here shows that it has been thoroughly optimized for this under pillow environment it sounds completely different so does it matter where I am in the pillow the sound does fade As you move away from it but not significantly like I can still hear the video while all the way on the other end of the pillow okay but what happens when you turn and lie on your back okay I'd
say you lose about 20% of the volume but still very audible I wouldn't say the sound is crystal clear this isn't a $150 audio experience but it's full it feels like you're enveloped within it because you kind of are there is also an app which is it's got power level and one advantage of this over earphones is that it should last s nights per charge a timer which is a little pointless since most streaming services have timers built into them and then different sound profiles which do genuinely improve the
clarity but here's the thing none of that matters if the person next to you can hear that sound the only purpose of this product is if it actually can isolate that audio to you and you only otherwise you might as well just listen on your laptop speakers Joseph can I borry you I just need a bed partner if I'm lying down like this and I'm listening to my bedtime shows how much can you hear and how disturbing is it to your sleep that's quite disturbing okay yeah don't look that so that would that
would stop you from sleeping yes it would stop me from well among other reasons okay eliminate the fact that it's one of our videos it's just out loud enough that I want to try and listen to it m so it's kind of too present to be ignored it's 80% towards achieving its goal but until it gets to that 100% where you can't hear it yeah it's pointless yeah it's actually worse than sence cool that's handy right thank you so for the time being this is about a 4 out of 10 have you ever wanted to
add so much complexity to the simple Act of taking a selfie that it becomes actually easier just to ask someone to take a picture of you well my guess is the air selfie is going to be the perfect product for you okay I mean I'll give it this this is impressively small and light considering that this is a drone this is a camera system and I mean this is a computer of sorts you know there's supposedly an AI powered autofly feature on board plus also really nice quality finish it very much feels like
one of those teenage engineering style very high quality toy type projects then I'm just thinking surely surely this camera is not so amazing that it's worth keeping a drone in your back pocket at  theory okay we're technically Airborne although I'm not doing anything right now why are you moving it's like when a fly is trying to escape from having flown indoors oh my God you're trying to kill me can you come down please please please please please ah okay so propellers automatically turn
off when it reaches your hand that's pretty cool so what I want to try here is autoly it should follow me oh all right so I've got it on face mode hello don't care oh dear Cal down no that's not okay yeah okay I can see my face where are where are you going where  there's a lot of people around here that are wondering what just happened the thing so tiny no one saw anything technically I could take off from here don't do that probably  there as you can see though the quality
is absolutely atrocious I've in almost broad daylight and I look like a shadow right let's see if I can get this face tracking to work okay it's technically technically locked onto  face what kind of artificial intelligence is this okay look here's the thing this has so many features like it can do a wide shot of you it can go far away and do a zoom shot of you it can fly off take a little video and then come back to you but the fundamentals of this drone are just not even close to
good enough to be able to pull them off in a way that anyone would use I'm feeling like a 3 out of 10 but if you're not a photo kind of person there's another way that you can self- indulge for $150 with a personalized toaster uh did they actually include a real cooked slice of bread so anyways this toaster the Jesus toaster is that what I bought I'm completely lost this is probably the weirdest thing I've ever unboxed so uh what's it like to use now I got to say for $150 you expect a pretty good slice of
bread coming out of it but this does look an awful lot like a generic toaster with some little metal plates added inside of it oh craigy that's me every part of this really does scream made in someone's garage so I imagine the way this works is you've got heating elements behind and then this metal plate blocks off those heating elements except for Within These gaps here so I assume my face is going to be the  toast so bad is it's hard to get bre you say bre all right let's just cut to the
chase how am I going to taste while we let that do its thing check this out you can now ask the Arya AI baked into the Opera browser to literally generate an image at the to of a button actually we can see how this compares to the toaster make a toast with a realistic face to post on Instagram oh oh is absolutely horrifying but yeah if you're going to do something cursed might as well do it properly and it's not just that it now also understands the images that you give it oh I think our toast is
ready that is absolutely atrocious is that my face which one's AR this is definitely properly toasted I mean look at the back of it it's just this whole metal plate mechanism is well it's not good so let's say I want to confirm whether or not this is in fact a face on my toast let's ask is this a face on my toast the first image is clearly a photoshopped image of a face on toast the second image shows a piece of toast with some burn mark s that vaguely resemble a face but it's not a clear or
intentional image but also this is the only browser where literally every single thing is one click away if someone's airing you whatsapp's right here you want to listen to music while working the music player is down here I don't even want to spoil the rest just give it a go using my link in the  plate crispy two out of 10 products at Max a stationary vacuum cleaner cuz if only there was some way to bring a vacuum cleaner straight to the mess you wanted to clean H Maybe by 2100 we'll
have figured that one out I'm actually puzzled right now with how many fingerprints are on this thing I mean the thing is brand new and it's meant to be a cleaning product but seriously I am beused this is called the ivac home but what is the actual benefit of it in the home so these right here are infrared sensors they detect when rubbish gets within range of the vacuum and then that turns on the motor on the inside which according to these guys removes no joke 100% of dust hair and debris so that's
going to have to be a very powerful motor so I have prepared a little cocktail to test this thing of trash yes cooking is my passion don't ask where it came from but it's all to answer one simple question how close does trash have to get to this vacuum for it to detect it and suck it up right nothing at 50 cm nothing at 40 nothing at 30 20  10 so technically it has detected the trash I don't even think it's removed 1% of it okay well let's see what happens when you push it closer oh W wo
W and now it's self-destructed is it is it dead what it did suck up it did with tremendous Force but I mean what now okay okay I see I see only cycles for 7 Seconds at a time so that you I guess don't end up with a vacuumed cat I still don't understand why in a home setting because like I guess yeah if you have a couple of specks of dirt sitting 30 cm away from it then it's not such a big deal to kick them towards it and maybe it will detect some of them but then also what if the rubbish is all the way
over here if you had a traditional vacuum cleaner you can take it to that spot and suck it up but here you have to take that rubbish and manually push it all the way towards your vacuum cleaner off crying out loud and the infrared sensors are not even picking up the individual piece of rubbish they literally have to see the broom also notice how the dirtiest part of this whole kitchen is the area directly in front of this vacuum cleaner okay I'm tired of this thing here's some burnt face
toast zero out of 10 ah yes the belt that's also a power bank I think the most money I've ever spent on a belt before this one is about $30 so this better be something special oh so the belt comes separate and then the Buckle SL power bank is this meaty thing in here oh dear uh this is not one of my better peels I apologize so it is a handmade leather belt which immediately gives it some value oh this is cool so it looks like they've designed their own custom one siiz fits-all solution so
they've hot print Ed a whole load of these different ratchets directly onto the leather and then this Buckle allows you to just stop at any point on any of them to confirm your size as someone whose belt size seems to consistently fall somewhere in between two of the Buckle holes this is how you do it for me right let's put it on and I think it's time to find out how much can this actually charge your phone dis can I borrow your phone please oh this is actually where it comes in handy um
drisha likes to keep her battery on the very very edge so it's on 15% right now then the cable for this thing they package it like it's a forensic specimen I can kind of see why because like have they not heard of USB C to C I've just realized one of these is a flat cable the other one is a circular cable the attention to detail right well just plugging in my belt right let's see what it can do okay it doesn't seem to work on any modern iPhone which is just bizarre so I'm going to try it on a Google pixel
8 and it does appear to be charging so we're at 15% right now so let's see where it gets to honestly I'm just not really sure what on Earth this gadget is on the face of it it very much feels like a piece of tech for the sake of being a piece of tech but let's dig deeper it's fun presentation you got to give him that it definitely feels designed for gifting oh yeah okay so it's not got power baked inside of it so you need to plug it in at all times oh no oh oh that's awful that's really bad
the intro animation alone dropped it a couple of points so this is basically five customizable pixel art displays each with a 128x 128 resolution it actually does look a lot like they just taped five Apple watch faces together so I feel like how useful this is rests on what you're going to be able to put on those displays so let's have a look oh I see so there's two types of faces you get ones that span every single screen in a pre-configured way or you can individually decide what you're placing
on every single one of them and there is a massive gallery of Stills and animations that you can apply to it let's have a look at one of the pre-made ones oh you can have um one of those Nixie tube clocks and it doesn't look that great I mean for starters the screens don't fill the entire area but also they're LCDs which means that they very much look like screens nothing about the contrast or the color reproduction is at all convincing oh you can display your YouTube channel
subscribe count like the name of this tile is YouTube video list so if I click yes oh okay so it's got the date it's got the time the subscriber count the The View count is that right do we have "5,681 million views I feel like when I" was very early on in the channel this is the kind of thing I was looking for I did love the idea of tracking every single new subscriber you know what this feels like this feels like the most designed for Tik Tok product I think I've ever gotone hands on with
everything is designed to look fun and interesting from a distance but it doesn't do anything a phone doesn't already do and it's not very good quality and in a pretty similar vein of potentially not necessary screens it's time we find out what on Earth is going on with these Eco earphones cuz I mean these things are more expensive than a set of airpods pro it's all a little bit slicker than I was expecting and it says right on the home menu long press to chat GPT 40 that I was not expecting hey
uh translate this to Hindi I'm never going to give you up who okay I mean it's not technically something you can't have on your phone but one tap from your home menu to get access to gbt 40 like that is I me it's already better than most of those AI pin products wait a second that looks an awful lot like a a SIM card tray we get a sim tool oh wow okay so out of my Samsung phone and into my earphones can you try and text me oh my God wait that worked you're texting my earphones right now it's actually such a
tiny screen that it's painful to write on like my my thumbs are aching my neck is atrociously bent over and every single word I type is wrong so let's see what else we can do so you swipe to the side and you've got access to a bunch of installed apps and then there's a store so you got Spotify you've got eom music which I guess is their own music service title okay so this is by no means the full Google Play Store but it's a specific selection of apps that they've decided could be useful on your
earphones some of these menus give away that it's actually built on a very old version of Android something like Android 7 or 8 I'm going to say but they've just dressed it up very nicely there with let me just log in oh my God got to do it on this keyboard okay all right give me like 10 minutes oh my God can't believe I'm doing this we're in business this is Spotify it is absolutely miniature I don't know like when would you choose to browse Spotify this way as opposed to just taking your
phone out of your pocket but the big Flagship feature that they keep honking on about with these earphones is the real time translation take this thing for a spin let's do it okay okay you so this is called dual earbud mode so you click the right earbud Let's Go Spanish you said see hola yoy Joseph okay so it said hello I am hose I heard me as well which is interesting there's a decent delay this is a slightly worse version of the translation that exists with both Google
and Samsung now right so let me try um hey where is the library okay so it works from the the yeah it's pretty good so what did you hear I heard oh yeah Desta which is I think correct the quality just isn't there for what is supposed to be more expensive than it's not there but the systems are kind of in place like it's co that the transcript is available on there it's called that you can activate via the stems of the earphones but the quality and the latency needs work yeah
I like that the different colors that's nice it's like very clean UI if you were able to fit all of the text on there it's weird that it's cutting off its own text when it knew the size of it own actually should probably just listen to  Spotify well they definitely sound better than they feel the moment you take them out you think what is this cheap plasticky thing okay I mean I just feel like this is yet another textbook example of one tech product trying to do two very separate things and doing
neither as well as having two separate Tech products and to be honest even if you had just $350 to spend and you needed to buy both a phone and a pair of earphones I would probably still recommend you buy a separate phone and pair of earphones it's just you do not want to use this screen for your main smartphone at $350 then the second most expensive product in this video this is the bartesian and I guess you could say it's kind of like the coffee maker of cocktails and man is this an
unexpectedly weighty bit of Kit my first thought is actually like quite a few of the products in this video this feels surprisingly high quality I've tested a lot of viral Tik Tok Gadgets in my time and usually the whole appeal is this does something cool and this doesn't cost a lot of money and so when you actually get them in your hand you're like oh this is made of very cheap plastic but not actually the case here all these canisters are proper glass got a proper heavyduty rubber mat as well
underneath so let's break down the value proposition here the way they try and sell this thing is if you live in a big city and you go out and you get a cocktail you're probably going to pay about $15 for that drink using one of these bartesian capsules and it's apparently $225 per drink okay so capsule goes in like so and actually I've just realized there is a barcode reader up there which is presumably scanning the barcode on the capsule to identify what drink you're trying to
make although then that does mean this is only going to work with Barian  M all right it says place a highball glass with ice under the dispenser oh well I know just the way to get some ice in here let's go honeycomb I think I'm going to use this tray every single time I make a cocktail from now on okay bigger cup that's how it's done then you get to select your spirit strength so we'll go light and then you click mix and then the idea is that it draws the spirit it needs to use to make that drink from one
of these canisters in the sides wow that was fast that was really fast so is that just  oh having some mix maybe while we're out of this might  flavor it really did just need a mix good soup so on one hand I get it this makes sense to me I understand why it's popular it's cool it's a centerpiece and it makes drinks really quickly but then if you properly think about it what is it actually doing it's not cooling the drinks down you need an ice cube it's not carbonating the drinks
everything that comes out of it is still it's barely even mixing them you need a spoon for that the only thing that it is doing is making sure that your drink has the correct amount of spirit and it's not too strong but then I just feel like soak at a shot glass so fancy fun pretty pointless four out of 10 oh actually as promised before we continue let's see  spoon start by peeling off the rubber at the back I'm very curious any predictions what tech is hiding underneath oh I see a battery a FL a few
moments later time and two finger slices later we inside and so we have a battery this metal contact point is literally nothing more than a metal contact point but if you follow the lead from that battery it goes all the way into an LED light over here and nothing else so the spoon Tech is not just a spoon it's a spoon and a light time for the most expensive "product of them all the $1,400 device" devices that claim to have reinvented walking it's an extremely heavy box so
we take this layer off and then nice it's a cool bag does not smell good though that is straight off the lines and then the moon Walkers below that so I know what you're thinking shoes with wheels at the bottom designed to make you faster skates they're called skates but actually that's specifically what the brand is trying to get away from because apparently you genuinely do just walk this isn't like skating because you're not needing to learn new skill I won't lie to you now that I've got these
things here in person the efficiency part of my brain is actually very much excited to see how much time I could potentially save and how fun this could be as far as putting them on uh kind of intuitive but a little bit of a faf you have these magnetic tags that latch on and then you tighten using the velcro and then you basically just hold the power button on the back of each shoe I absolutely love the fact that there's no phone app it's actually really refreshing for everything you need to
just be on the products themselves so now both lights are green which shows me they're active okay right and now in theory I just walk this is my first time ever actually doing this are these skates or is this walking reinvented uh okay all right all right oh my god oh I am moving oh no car car car car car car oh it's a really interesting feeling it feels like the gravitational pull beneath my feet has just increased tfold it's weird I can definitely feel the power beneath my
feet oh oh I'm starting to get it okay so you have to put a little bit more pressure down you almost have to be it's kind of like riding a bike the more confidence with which you do it the better you're going to be at it oh my goodness Conquering the uphill terrain it feels secure and Powerful wow okay we're going now I can say with absolute certainty I've never walked at this pace before like I've tried to balance on some pretty odd vehicles in my time this doesn't feel like one of them honestly
I'm pretty impressed if the reason that your walking places is to burn more calories then going faster using a device like this makes zero sense but if you're walking a lot of places because you have to walk a lot of places then by all means this is a faster cooler way of doing that not pointless at all really 8  10 oh and actually while we're at it the belt so the phone is on it's on 12% it's been charging this entire time it shows it's been charging this entire time but
it's going down in battery have I ever used a charger it's not even able to keep battery constant I mean it serves the function of being a belt but you know this isn't this isn't a belt review channel so as far as a tech is concerned one out of 10
