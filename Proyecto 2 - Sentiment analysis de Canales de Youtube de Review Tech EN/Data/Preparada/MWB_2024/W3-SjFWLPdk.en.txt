I just found this device that apparently charges your phone with fire let see if it actually works it's called the camp stove 2 plus and it apparently uses patented combustion technology to create a Vortex of smokeless Flames W it definitely looks premium seeing what I see so this is the Hub where it's taking in the heat energy from the fire and turning it into electricity that your other gadgets can use it's quite cool about this is you should just be able to grab some wooden
sticks from outside imagine doing this every time you need to charge your phone so they're going to go into this chamber here and goes a fire starter so you can see there's three different bars here one at the end shows you the battery level this shows you the fan speed and this one here shows you how much energy the fire is currently Genera which in our case is zero oh we got one Fire Light so this is what a normal fire looks like then the fan kicks it and that's what turns it into this Vortex oh
look that means the battery's charging what this is for is for people who are lighting a fire anyways and just don't want to waste the heat energy that comes out of it boom it works
