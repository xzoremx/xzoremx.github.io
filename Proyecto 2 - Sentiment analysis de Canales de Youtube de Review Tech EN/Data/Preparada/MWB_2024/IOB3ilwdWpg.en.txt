three dream Limited Edition phones first up the Pokémon phone which took me 2 years to track down and find it comes packaged in an actual pokeddex with tons of custom accessories like this Pikachu tail for your keys and this Pokémon stand it's got stickers of some of the most iconic original Pokémon and even two different types of Pikachu case I'm just trying to imagine showing this to my 10-year-old self but even cooler than that the Hello Kitty bir which looks fairly straightforward when you see the
packaging and accessories and yeah when you get the phone out you'll notice it has a slight furry texture to it and this really subtle Hello Kitty p but by far the best part of this is that it's made with photochromic glass which reacts to the UV light and sunlight to change color that's how you make a limited edition but nothing beats the attention to detail in this gening impact F start with you get earbuds presented in a miniature backpack styled off one of the characters but the main
event has to be the phone it's got 3D artwork which looks incredible there's a mouse mat there's a premium multi-layer case and each box is like a mini surprise and the attention to detail in both the phone's exterior and its interface is next level
