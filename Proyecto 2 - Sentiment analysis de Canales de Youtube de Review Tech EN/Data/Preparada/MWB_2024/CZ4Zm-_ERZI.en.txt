bizarre Amazon products that actually work starting with the umbrella hat my face is still bone dry and I have two hands free and no shame at all then we've got the mob slippers wow they're just inflated they go around your feet or your socks so let's say there is a sudden spillage on the floor is this going to work all instincts tell me not to put my foot in this but pretty cool my feet still feel dry somehow the recycling bin mug looks well like absolute garbage but apparently does
have a useful purpose when you have your hot drink in there this lid allows it to stay hot not a rubbish idea the bug ass salt is a gun that fires out salt to get rid of flies so let's say there's a fly over there you reload oh you push the safety catch and then 3 2 1 kind of works I have some doubts about the toilet piano mat so I think this turns it on oh my God it's so loud and I guess it could be useful if you wanted to use it to let people know the toilet is occupied
