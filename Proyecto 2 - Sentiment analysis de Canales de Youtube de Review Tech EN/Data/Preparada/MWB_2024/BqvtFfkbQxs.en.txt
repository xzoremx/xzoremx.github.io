hello hello welcome to our dream house but what's also so crazy about this place is that this is also where we're going to have the Next Generation Mr who's the boss Studio So the plan is we're going to turn this into a nine-part video series where every single room is going to be its own episode each of these is a different video and we're taking it from zero to the most max out thing you can possibly imagine the start of the studio and the actual coolest thing about this place is
that there isn't just going to be one  have you found the this is Studio A technically a garage we spent our entire lives filming outside of an old attic bedroom and to have a space that is actually rectangular that we can just start from scratch it's just amazing we can actually walk around and not walk into the camera or the lighting or the microphones I've nearly impaled myself many many times on that microphone so the idea of this room is basically to take the setup that we you already have
but take it to a whole other level we're thinking one big screen across the entire wall this is a room you're going to see a lot of so we want to make sure that it's just spot on yeah so if you stand here Josh and I stand here I think a lot of good times are going to happen in these positions this is the plant room which is actually I don't know why it's called a plant room there aren't any plants in here so this entire house is going to be run by the control 4 system it's like a
protocol that a lot of Smart Homes use to be able to link together lots of non-smart things it's kind of like the brain of a house we're basically trying to design it so that all the TVs in the house all the electronics you don't actually need big boxes in every single room cuz the boxes will be here and they're all wired individually to the rooms polished concrete it is actually like part of the reason we picked this place cuz I actually think it's really pretty and it's also really easy to
clean and you can slide on it and you can slide on it but we will show you Studio B soon because that's like at the back of the garden it's probably the coest room of the entire house very exciting this is probably my favorite room and what is it this is going to be the storage room we slowly took over arin's Family House room by room with the amount of tech gear and supplies that we have all the original intentions for the rooms in that house no longer existed so we thought we'd start from scratch with
this room being the storage room we're going to have massive floor to sealing storage racks everywhere had to ized by what they are when we need them why we need them a place where everything has a place as you can probably tell drer is to an obsessive level organized to a reasonable level brish is a sensible amount of organized oh yeah and so this space here this is where I want to build the dream top down setup so right now anytime we get a new tech product we have to film
with a top down camera but the current top down setup is kind of me or my knees there's a little table and I'm kind of opening the product on the table with my arms stretched out like this being very careful to actually keep it in the shot of the camera because it's so narrow here we have the space to build a top down camera set with no limitations basically like any size product we can just unbox it on the floor it's such a dream okay let's move to some more fun rooms so this is the gym I just love the
Scandinavian style architecture that the guy's gone for but then yeah so the cool part of this house is this will also be a place to film stuff like anytime we're testing Fitness bands or Health Tech there's a space for it because there's these like polished concrete floors with no real gap between anything you can just wheel a camera in so bathroom in here all the walls are Venetian plaster the ceiling is wood I actually can't believe that we we like own it it's a bathroom with a really cool
sink scratching with the watch oh no that feels like the position you're going to be in after a really heavy housing party it does have a cherikee vibe to okay so you've seen disa's baby now you get to see mine this is the cinema room I let you do the honest oh my God come in this carpet is so plush and the noise when you walk in is immediately isolated so it feels silent you present the video from now on this is where our own sleeves this is actually where we sleep the house is currently unfurnished
completely so we've set up a little bed mat here and aon's key priority a little switch set up here literally that is male living space right there the other thing you probably noticed when you walked in though is the noise just disappears and that's because well basically the entire room is just surrounded with acoustic paneling it's like completely empty right now so we've got to find the speakers the screen the projector I had this little gaming Trio with two of my friends and we play this
game called Monster Hunter together and the entire time we've played it we've always played online and all I've dreamed being able to do was to be able to say come over and let's play together and I want this room to be where that happens oh and then quickly before we go to the main  and so yesterday we were sitting in the front of the house where there's loads of Pebbles and we were picking up each individual Pebble saying we own this we named this Pebble and Arin hasn't let go
of this Pebble since oh no so so now we go upstairs to the main floor I also love looking up here so this is the kitchen dining room living room and it's just it's so much space we never dreamed of being able to have like this much space what's really fun about this as well is that we're going to do it together like we're actually going to be able to build this room into the Perfect final form this is what we've been looking for for ages and one of the key things was just tons of light it's like
the best empty shell you could Poss possibly hope for this fridge oh technology got to love it opens like this one and three times the idea is when you approach the fridge it gives you a little projection on the floor that says door open place your foot underneath that projection and the door opens and you can change the temperature of different shelves to suit different wines um I don't think we know wine well enough right now so there'll just be lots of milkshakes in here you know I was saying
this entire house is run by the contr four system that means that every single light in this house can be configured exactly how we want it so you'll notice these buttons they're unlabeled and that's because you can make this button turn on all the lights to maximum you can make this one turn on one particular light and you can make this one turn on all the lights but at a certain level of brightness so we're going to go through every single light switch and program exactly the percentage and which lights
we want on for each one which is actually the most fun thing ever but what I actually find the coolest thing about this kitchen is the fact that in a way it's kind of modular like you open each of these cabinets but then you can actually sh the cabinet doors so that this can be a permanent space for extra appliances like a microid and this is true for every single one of these cabinets and I just love how these lights gently glow as you start to open the doors oh so satisfying ah and then
also the whole thing is symmetrical so if we didn't already know that we wanted wanted to buy the house and this is another one of my favorite bits this is all the manuals to every part of this house the flooring the ovens the fridge and I'm a read every page of the manual person so I can't wait to get into this looks like a real page Turner there's going to be a dining area and then this is I mean I don't know actually what is this I love the idea of making this like really comfy cozy cushions everywhere
and then you can just sit and like I can read you can be playing and then this is the living room area when you start any new Venture in Indian culture um your family comes over and you do a few prayers just to I guess to bring you luck so that's what we did yesterday going to have a massive fireplace going around here so it's going to feel this whole room is going to feel really warm cozy so where we're going to play board games watch a bit of TV yeah and one of the big things
that I would really like to do here is create a really cool audio setup just just listen all about the tech you could have floor standing speakers here and here just firing at you while you're in the soci seat it's like this is like the place right here how do you do that tell this opens up and it creates this feeling of inside and outside almost as if like this has now become one big space one of the things we think about quite a lot is circadian rhythms and getting outside as soon as possible
in the morning and then making sure that it's dark as soon as it is dark so you get the best sleep but we will come back to the garden and Studio B which is overlooking the entire property and this is the weirdest door we've ever seen because essentially the hinge is partway through it so you can either push this way or you can push this way and you can also definitely get your hands stuck in this this room is going to be an office and we've never actually had an office
before I currently work most of the time at a standing desk in the kitchen and I work on the edge of your standing desk in the kitchen and so our idea for this space was to create the most Zen tranquil work environment that happens to be right next to the kitchen I guess we' need three desks in here so you me Joseph yeah he's our everything CL oh yeah and this actually is something we talked about yesterday is the idea that we're building our Home Spaces these are the spaces we're living in but because the
entire floor is polished concrete and we can just wheel around a camera rig everything here is also our filming spaces the whole house is just going to be purpose-built to make it so easy to film and I can't wait you can't already tell right so up the stairs oh look at this see the best thing about this house is there is sunlight everywhere also power sockets everywhere because one of the things this place is almost custom built for is the idea of it being low maintenance so you stick a robot vacuum
cleaner one on each floor and it will have absolutely no problem at all yeah there are no Nooks no no crannies it's just clean rectangular floors and then this is the master bedroom we're Masters apparently now sria has lived her entire life in your room is probably 2 m squared it's the size of a bed and everything you ever own must fit into one of these cupboards half of one of these cupboards cuz I can know you reach so far cupboard this big has been the most space I've ever had I can be here
you can actually close the door okay let's continue the idea for this room is keep it hyper focused on sleep so a bed some side tables and no clutter oh yeah and we usually spend like a good 10 minutes whenever we get to a new hotel working out who should take what side no no you decide which side you're going to take and later I find out that you take the side with the plug sockets on it and he preemptively decided they have a lot of gadgets but this is perfectly symmetrical in terms
of access to lighting power there's going to be airon in every single room and also underfloor heating on each floor okay so this it's a bath I actually I mean you don't own a bath and I don't think I have used a bath in 15 years but this is just so nicely designed I mean you could fit two people in there you could fit two people and you can have a nacho ball to share sitting in between you oh but also because the lighting is all configurable this has been set up so that there is a bath mode for lighting
which turns off basically everything apart from a spotlight you'd see it better at night but it's kind of like a performance this is the laundry room so laundry rooms tend to be on the bottom floor but the fact that it's on this floor is so cool because this is where our bathrooms are so you can hop into the shower take your clothes off and then you only need to take like five steps to wash them those make too much sense and then the final thing is the guest rooms so there's three guest rooms
and they all follow the same design aesthetic as the rest of the house so storage the same bathroom so we obviously need to test this in practice but in theory this whole control 4 lighting system is like stupidly flexible like you can even link that to the lights baked into the headboard of a bed so everything in the room can actually be one switch Yeah and it connects to your TVs your speakers so through the control for app you could turn on your TV choose what you want to
watch turn on your music and then that right there that's Studio B hello that was quick so this is Studio B before we go inside though if you come back here I want to show you something that sounds a bit dodgy at this point we are way into things I cannot believe we have territory this is a quarter size basketball court here we just have like a cage to test technology and the next time we have like a jumping robot or like something we want to smack with an axe to see if it can withstand it it's
an arena pretty much every day drish and I we come out of the house and we walk around and we kick a ball and this is now where we can do that and one thing we want to do is add in flood lights all around so we can play all night under the stars under the trees oh no so sorry and so that AR can see where he's throwing the ball that's fair I'll get it in now though we uh we'll fix that in post so one of the reasons that we could actually afford this house is because the garden is tiered so it's on four
different levels and I think most people don't like that but there's a lot of perks that come with it like because we're so high up right now you get the direct sunlight nothing blocking it and you just have this complete 180 view of the sky and you just feel so free it is absolutely stunning oh yeah and right here we are building a dream outdoor entertainment area we just want to spend as much time as possible outside with our friends and family we have ideas the garden is going to be one of the videos
in this series and in that video we're going to go nuts on that setup and just turn it into something amazing and now this right yes okay so this  no all right there we go so this is where magic happens the plan is to film lots of our reviews and our kind of traditional videos in Studio A but anytime we want to do something different or a little bit special this is what we use we're trying to make this the flagship iconic just like a completely Bonkers Next Generation Studio we want to have like the white
and blue Mr who's the boss colors like plastered all over and this will actually be a space where we can walk around we can like go over here and test something and then we can go over here and test something else so currently when we're filming a video where we've got to test lots of different types of products we're basically hopping between all the various rooms of the house to do that we're just there with like four tube lights creating a new set for every single product and if there's like 20
products in one of those videos we spend half our time just setting up each shot so the idea of this room is that it's one space where from every single angle it is just perfectly lit ready to go just looks beautiful you know you want have every type of set you can need a gaming setup a computer setup a TV setup a couch setup we build this space with every single product type in mind so that there's an environment to test every single thing and then we decide does it make it into the main house oh I
like that and then this is where we keep our um bodies um products so this out housee was originally designed to be like a pool house for a swimming pool and so all the controls and tanks and we're going to go down there maybe anything that we don't like product wise goes in there the place where products go to die so yeah different kind of video obviously but I also feel like this whole series is such a once in a-lifetime Opportunity the plan is to do one video every single weekend basically
until we're done here so what can I say um thank you thank you for making this possible this is I me it's more than a dream come true to be honest
