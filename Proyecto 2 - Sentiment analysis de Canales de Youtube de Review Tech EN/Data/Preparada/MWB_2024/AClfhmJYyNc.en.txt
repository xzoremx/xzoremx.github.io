these are some of the rarest limited edition Tech products on the entire planet so that's phones yes but also bigger things like literally the biggest limited edition product I've ever unboxed and we're going to start with something pretty Cutting Edge but only in the very literal sense this is a £45 or $56 razor oh my God this package is insane how much do they think I lift oh my God Cy this isn't four Gamers by Gamers this is four bodybuilders by Psychopaths ah but yeah this razor is made in what
must be the weirdest Tech collab I've ever seen Gillette and Razer you know the gaming company apparently this is a magnetic display stand but I have doubts and it says four Gamers by Gamers which I find kind of hilarious as the last thing your hair will ever see but you know what's even stranger about all of this it originated as an April Falls joke in 2023 Razer made this absolutely ridiculous trailer for a fictional product a mouse that you could also use to keep your facial hair
in check while gaming cuz you know us real Gamers don't leave the basement for months at a time and while obviously they didn't make that that trailer had such a vocal reception that it must have triggered the thought wait a sec why doesn't Razer make a Razer did it do a good job did it I can't see it's actually a really good shape which I'm not actually surprised by it cuz this is a limited edition version of the exact same Gillette Labs razor that I've just recently showed you I've been carrying
around every day in my backpack anyway do you mind filming from that side only I've not not had hair on here for 8 years probably but now we move all the way up to $300 with the Starfield Chrono Mark Smartwatch for those of you who don't know Starfield was one of the most hyped video game launches in recent history it was meant to be open world exploration but on an interplanetary scale like you see a planet or a moon you can land on that planet or Moon I mean the game had to be a pretty big
deal for them to make a custom Smart watch Just For The Limited Edition version of it so this is the steelbook display case inside of which no way that's a cred stick these are the uh for some reason physical currency in this space age futuristic setting and on the back is the code to redeem the game that is such a smart way to fuse the game's world into the real world but this is what you're mostly paying for the Chrono Mark watch which again is an actual in-game item that you play with oh OD AR
near my butter fingers I got to say whoever designed this packaging needs a pat on the back I mean this is proper metal running down the sides the detailing as well I feel so immersed and then to open it wait so pull down and then twist oh my God the nerd inside of me is struggling to cope so this is a constellation patch constellation is the faction trying to uncover the mysteries of the universe this thing is called the chronome mark watch established in 2188 that's pretty cool and then oh this
interior material is incredible it's like really bouncy Rubber and then the watch itself it feels a lot more premium than I was expecting it to all the plastic areas have this nice matte finish and then all the metallic areas are actual metal wa not bad you know what it can actually do quite a lot too so obviously it tells the time but what's quite clever is because the clock hands go around the edge of the screen at all times you can keep reading the time while also doing other things wish my
Apple watch had that so it's got the current moon phase it's got a temperature sensor barometer magnetometer it's coming pretty close to making me feel like a real astronaut accelerometer so you know it can measure your steps and it also connects to your phone via Bluetooth so if I tap this for example yeah I can play and pause the songs from my phone Spotify it's definitely not an Apple Watch replacement it's a simple watch but just done really well and you got to admit
there is something so uniquely surreal about wielding in your real hands items that you spent the last 6 month month holding in your virtual hands in a video game it looks like every time you turn it off it gives you a different parting message or quote from a sci-fi movie this feels an awful lot like a 9 out of 10 to me now this is where being able to look at all limited edition Tech and not just phones starts to get juicy when two companies do a cool special collab we
can test the full Suite of Products that come from it so you know Transformers right well bumblebe is one of the most famous he's one of the Autobots the good guys and while not the biggest or the strongest he just he tries very hard and that's endearing in its own way so the tech company red magic decided to bottle his yellow puppy dog energy into a mouse a keyboard and a phone so first is the mouse they call this the ultra Edition and to be fair they price it like an ultra Edition too but that does mean a
few cool things though see when you really get into mice it's not just about how smooth it Glides across your surface it's also about the level of sensitivity how many pixels or dots that your mouse cursor moves across per inch that you physically move your mouse or the DPI a normal office Mouse might go up to like "2,000 DPI or 5,000 DPI gaming mice like" this one "26,000 okay so this is the lowest DPI" setting oh my goodness that's painful yeah you could not play like that you
turn it around you click the DPI button and it turns it up now straight away this is like the stock DPI that most non-gaming mice would ship with and it's workable I now only have to move my wrist instead of my whole arm so let's go up another level oh okay so this is starting to feel very sensitive this feels like enough DPI for any kind of competitive gamer who needs twitch controls and the ability to kind of instantly spin around so what happens when we go up again ah
hey okay it's starting to get a little bit dizzy with this motion but I suppose the benefit of this is that now I barely need to move my physical movements are now basically imperceptible but you can see how much differ difference it's making on the screen the mouse is accurate enough that it feels like you're taking full advantage of that DPI and it's not disorienting the design though it does look sick it's pretty nice and Meaty to rip onto if we just plug it in oh yes the LEDs are
Tastefully done I got to say it's not too much it's just the logo at the back and then these two on either side of the mouse buttons which I assume are bumble be's eyes so the lights actually turn on when you leave the mouse on standby but then as soon as you grip it and move it they turn off it does make a lot of sense for a Bluetooth mouse cuz you don't want to spend all of your precious battery life lighting up his eyes although I will say glossy translucent plastic is an interesting choice for the
single tech product most prone to fingerprints and by interesting I of course mean brain dead because uh good luck keeping this clean but I do feel like it's going to look really cool together once we've unboxed all the Bumblebee stuff so keyc cap remover a braided cable and this is the mechanical keyboard oh la la yes this is like the most unashamedly committed to the brief design I think I've ever seen it's got a brushed aluminium body this feels good I love the slightly passive aggressive win
more games Motif that they've got plastered across it like okay I'll try it also just feels like a really nicely built keyboard this is one of red Magic's first mechanical keyboards ever it's quite difficult to get this much right on your first attempt so you can toggle your lighting Effects by pressing FN insert W there some really funky ones and having this like dedicated lighting strip really draws your attention to it you can toggle colors with FN plus delete and then the speed of the
animation and the brightness of the keys with FN plus your arrow keys which is a pretty nicely done system cuz you've got complete control without needing any external programs but I will say the lighting is not the brightest H if you look from the side you can see the keyboard has quite a significant downward slope which some people like for you know key reachability but I person find a bit of a pain like literally a bit of a pain cuz I've caused myself quite a bit of hand
trouble from all this arching but here's the question on my mind why is there a screen on the keyboard we just finally got rid of screens on keyboards on the MacBooks now we got another one okay so it gives you volume control well that's kind of pointless since volume control is literally a key press away anyway you can monitor your computer's performance which again your computer internally monitors its own stats anyway and then you've got control over lighting brightness speed color
so it's literally a complete duplication of the functionality already embedded within the keyboard that's a bit disappointing I was expecting the screen to add some sort of new dimension the only thing that's somewhat cool about it is it does let you upload your own images to it and display them as like a permanent piece of customization but then at the same time what a tremendous waste of battery life but this is where the real fun comes with the mechanical keyboard the actual key mechanism
there's so many different types of key mechanism you can go for some are Ultra clicky and typewriter light but you can also go all the way to the complete opposite like super short key travel and no noise at all oh oh yes this is one of the best keyboards I've ever felt in my life these feel about halfway in between those two extremes they're quite low travel so that you can press very quickly but they also really let you feel when each key has been pressed which is really useful for games because
in a way then you're looking at your screen and your keyboard is reinforcing to you that you are indeed pressing the things that you think you're pressing you can also really feel the gasket structure which is basically a layer of rubber that absorbs the vibration it makes clicking softer but it also means that when I click this key for example that impact feels completely isolated from the key sitting right next to it so let's add the phone into that mix and it really feels like there's someone at the
Hasbro company whose entire job is just to hand out licensing deals for Transformers themed gadgets I'm pretty sure we've seen more limited edition Transformers products than like any other brand ever not that I'm complaining though they do look amazing so the phone comes in a hexagonal box kind of poetic for a bumblebee now I think about it there's a gaming fan which looks every bit as Extreme as you'd want it to on a phone this price a metal badge this is not half-hearted
stuff too I am on board the charger featuring Bumblebee's not so pretty face on it and it's a very fast charger too but I'll get back to that what's in here Sim ejector which has the Autobots logo oh manuals with every page also in theme clap clap and a case with a magnetic ring which looks like it's specifically designed for this coing fan to attach and then the phone oh no no no it keeps going there's not one but two USBC  guys I'm just thinking actually does this case allow it to work with apple
mag safe okay so yeah it snaps in it's just the phone doesn't have any wireless charging support well that feels intuitive I have to say this thing looks so good if I was not a blue and white kind of guy I would be a yellow and black guy it is still a glassback phone but they've really made it look like metal with this whole plate behind it and you can even see the exposed actual black metal screws it's very fitting for a robot themed phone and this fan is also pretty Next Level
this is a new gen caller that extends the refrigeration area to Now cover basically the entire contact surface but also it can now constantly monitor the temperature inside of the phone and scale its own output according to the needs of the phone but with the ability to cool the phone down by up to 30° C if needed I'm actually so hot right now oh my goodness me that is the best thing ever it's insane it's like a it's like a handheld refrigerator oh it's so reliably consistently cold and it's not
cool this is cold cold to the touch I mean just to give you an idea a 30° difference is enough to take you from a hot hot room into a room so cold that you would get frostbite if you stayed there you try it are you a fan oh also the charger that you saw this thing right here can do 165 W fast charging which is a pretty absurd figure so the phone is empty right now let's plug it in and come back in a few minutes to see just how fast 3 2 1 go and it's already off how is it at 1%
already now I don't know if this is just a British thing but it feels to me like Harry Potter was such a massive part of everyone's childhood every Christmas drisha and I basically do a movie marathon of the entire series and that's why seeing it all in tech form which is like my current passion hits so hard for me we actually have seen a Harry Potter film before but this is meant to be the next level up from that plus there's now a Harry Potter tablet too so let's get into the phone first my goodness it
feels like one of those uh interactive story books this is an image of diagonale by the way if you know you know then the phone and behind it that's the Sword of godric Gryffindor is this some sort of code for something I can't figure it out please tell me we're actually getting a sword in here oh right yeah okay well it's a 90 W charger and cable well that's a bummer but to be fair it's actually impressively small for a 90 W charging brick it's about the same size as Apple's 27 W one there's a second
compartment I like the Sim ejector that's the Hogwart School emblem and on the inside I love this case if you're feels very much designed with this specific version of the phone in mind and then on the inside is a soft felt finish with a dementa carved in which is not going to be enough to suck the fun out of this for  me there's actually so much going on here considering that the phone at a glance doesn't actually look messy they have crammed in a lot of Easter eggs you know I'm not even the resident Harry
Potter expert can you help me out I love this this is so awesome okay so what are all these okay so I actually have no idea what these are I know what all of these are that's the Hogwarts emblem Draco Dorian nunquam titas it's actually really strange it sounds really fancy and it means never tickle a sleeping Dragon what I think it's meant to be like you know the quote um let sleeping dogs lie it's like if you see a sleeping Dragon don't tickle it noted what are all these things so these are all the
seven haw rockes is it a spoiler if I explain a HS is there such thing as Harry Potter spoilers at this day Voldemort split his soul into seven different pieces so that he can't die just by someone killing him so the seven different things that he split into these are the seven things the seven items that's so cool it's Harry's lightning bolt where the flash is and then it says lumos because that's where you're lighting up from and lumos is a spell for light would you switch from an
iPhone to this yes hand it over hand it over i' switch for this backing this is a verbal contract oh I've just realized the curvature on this k case perfectly matches the curvature on the phone such that when you put them together that's how you do it that is how you do it it's shocking that I'm so surprised by this but you'd be amazed how many companies don't think to match their case designs with the phone designs 64% 64% how long has it been 15 and 1 12 minutes that is
extremely fast just before we turn it all on the tablet is something completely new similarly really tasteful box design it looks a lot like the excellent book cover art that we've had over the years what is in this it's not the tablet but it's so heavy oh the back has the long quote from the Sorting Hat trying to decide whether to put Harry in Slytherin or Gryffindor what oh my goodness it's hogwart's invitation letter but like also a proper leather-like carrying case with a magnet
where the stamp is I don't think I've ever been fanboying as hard as I am right now with this limited edition and then inside is is this another case yeah it looks like a hard case as a second option but hats off no P Nintendos to whoever made this this is a surreal experience and then there's another little slide out box which has stickers four pages of stickers okay then underneath the tablet three more boxes oh man don't tell me we're going to be able to control this thing with a wand
uh okay oh that's still pretty cool though it's a one colored very clearly custom stylus with Harry's lightning bolt next to the charging port in here is a Sim ejector tool and then manuals and in the final box is oh you doing so well it's just a standard white power  cable all right let's see what the bootup screens look like oh that was kind of funky smoker mirrors the tablet was a bit less interesting so the theming on this phone is it's okay it's a little half-hearted
I would say some icons are completely gold others have a little gold ring but they're still their normal colors there's actually very little they've done to this phone the folders look cool I guess oh this is cool the always on display has this smoke disappearing effect is this the Ravenclaw diadem yeah okay so thank you so look at this it's like smoke effect oh wait no it's changing oh that's even cooler cuz that's one of the other HW cruxes which one the locket of Voldemort
technically correct thank you wait so then every time you turn your phone on and off it Cycles to a new H Crux wow that's wicked what about when you plug it in oh it's kind of cool also just realized there's a little wizard's hat on the lock screen o no way quick way to change a wallpaper between the various houses isn't it kind of crazy that we live in a time where this whole package was $500 like all the effort and thought that went into this limited edition but even forgetting all of that just just
how much phone you now get like this thing right here is a nearly top-of-the-line chip it's a nice OLED display it's 16 gigs of RAM 512 gigs of storage 50 map main camera using Sony's light 600 sensor which is part of a whole new range of sensors which are designed for mid-range phones but I wonder if they're specifically better since it is a brand new Range okay so let's compare dr's old phone to D's new phone oh no the Harry Potter phone photo is atrocious compared to the iPhone
the difference is actually insane oh  lumos okay it's meant to turn the flashlight on the tablet's design is a lot simpler than the phone's design which is strange considering it has four times the canvas size to play with but I'm assuming they've done that because of the stickers oh I've just realized they've themed each one of these Pages after one of the houses I think I'm a Ravenclaw bu here we go I don't know what any of these items are so this is a 120 HZ 12.1in display
which is quite a nice size but it's only an LCD screen I guess because your screen is going to be a much bigger part of the cost of a tablet than it is on a phone you can save a lot by going for LCD versus OLED but you can tell it looks pretty washed out and is not nearly as bright as the phone the thing is also just a lot less powerful than the phone in every way like less powerful chip less Ram Less storage and it's a bit weird because your tablet especially big tablets like this are
usually where your proper work happens I'm guessing the company just decided that all of these Harry Potter products they need to be affordable and to make a tablet as affordable as a phone you need to cut more corners or you know bmot secretly their business manager ah so this is the redmi Smart patter I've just connected via Bluetooth it's actually surprisingly responsive and it's got not one but two different buttons on it so I can use one of them to cycle between which instrument I'm
writing with and the other one Cy between the color that's actually really well executed and that one has just turned to 100% how long exactly 30 minutes exactly 30 okay so the second half of charging is definitely slower than the first half but that's to be expected and it's actually got really really hot now that it's charged let's actually have a little look at this phone who you cannot say they don't try oh that wallpaper bumblebee is meant to be a pretty fast guy so it's kind of
cool that every single time you leave an app they've got this interactive wallpaper in which he Zips forward back into frame and they also give you quite a lot of different always on display options too feel like Transformers fans really get treated man this just makes me think red magic phones they're not perfect you know they do need to work on their camera quality and their software a bit but also holding this in my hands right now I I I can't shake the feeling that this as a slab of Hardware is
perfected I love the two-tone finish on the the back I love the smooth matte sides the slim borders of the phone and the fact that they're completely even plus the front camera is invisible I just feel like as a concept this right here is what we've been dreaming of ever since the very first smartphone now I got to give a rating for all of these okay six 7 this gets a nine and a sub to the channel would be transformative now for something that I 100% guarantee you did not see coming
this is the minions of insta 360's goto camera I won't lie to you I can't stand the minions I know this is an unpopular opinion but I nearly walked out of the cinema during minions 3 and I just drove past the cinema the other day to see that there's another one coming and I nearly H but I also someone who can appreciate a really well themed limited edition so this is the camera and what I really like about it is that it feels purposeful you can really tell that this collab didn't come about from like hm
which brand is going to bring the biggest media attention to our product but instead hey our camera already kind of looks like a minion wouldn't it be funny if is a really high quality paint job and it's just such a fun thumb-sized way to record some actually pretty decent looking 1440p video but this at its core is a go two whereas the company's actually just launched their next Generation go 3s and is sponsoring this video so I can give you an early look at it essentially they've taken the
perks of all their previous go cameras that they weigh less than 40 G that they come with all the magnets and attachments that you place them basically anywhere but now with a big focus on video quality because this now shoots in 4K resolution they made a 40 G camera that shoots 4K I have pens that weigh more than 40 G so I have no idea what they've done to make that happen whenever I use these go cameras this is how I do it so you put the included magnetic necklace on and the camera just
snaps in place it automatically turns itself on it turns itself off it records Snippets throughout your day and it can even edit them for you to the beat of a song and also now with the 3s if you're lose it you can find it with Apple's fine my and you can connect it to the action pod to turn it into a full-on vlogging style camera with a rotating screen and 140 minutes of battery life per charge so link below to check it out with a free extra screen protector I've also realized something really cool
about this watch it rotates the watch face based on which way up I'm looking at it now this confuses me this is the limited edition strawberry bare phone here's the thing even with his cute fluffy strawberry scented exterior this guy is one of the main villains from Toy Story why does he get his own limited edition anyways in the first box oh oh it actually smells like strawberry like really noticeably so there's a case I have no idea what this is a bracelet juvenile handcuffs and this is maybe a
phone stand wait let me just take a sniff wow it literally smells like I've dived head first into a cinema pick and mix stand so then the phone box you can see the word loto written everywhere which which is actually short for Lotso hug and bear you know the character's actual name a Sim ejector with his cursed face stamped onto it there's an insert with an about me card goodness me a page of matte stickers and then a completely clear case there's the phone below which nothing really of note it 
like okay so does the phone smell a strawberry no no it doesn't so what's the deal with this loto bear well turns out he is super popular in China he is mass-produced he's unusually fluffy for a villain and he smells like strawberry like very literally oh my God it's so good and so he's actually become a bit of a sensation outside of his real origin people are buying him as the strawberry bear not even knowing what he's from or who he was this is the guy who tried to kill Woody Buzz and the
Gang the phone itself has basically the same design as the case it's like very nearly cute with all the fruit patterned across it and the soft gold highlights going around the trim but then you look down and shivers the bear's face is like no joke 3D sculpted onto the back of this so I can feel every Contour this dude makes me so uneasy with his like eyebrows and face it's very very immediately clear though how much thought has gone into the skin and even the wallpaper almost looks like real fur
you're touching let's have a look at the charging animation no way strawberries are just falling into his hand like so much effort has gone into this and it's so strange now I just realized also they've developed a custom font for the lock screen clock every part of this user interface looks like you could stroke it so apparently we should have custom loto frames that we can use around our photos oh my goodness that is absolutely atrocious thanks strawberry bear I hate it but probably
the craziest part of this whole thing is that loto bear should also be your  oh to think this dude is hiding within your software skin at all times but I have to give credit where credits du for what it is it's really cool to get actually scentered stuff and I realized the reason I wasn't completely sure what this is is because I couldn't see how it attaches to your phone well magnets there's a ring of magnets in this case which allows the bear to just snap on and that is your phone
stand and then if you really well and truly want to create a monster and this weird lanyard handcuff thing attaches to the bottom like so who is this for who who would buy this I think this is meant to be endearing but it feels like a form of torture I mean as far as the execution goes I feel like it's hard to argue that this is not a 10 out of 10 but it's just that the idea that feels like a two to me I think I've got some weird strawberry bear phobia I'm not a fan now with the majority of limited edition
phones they're not actually more expensive than the company's normal phones they're not really designed for profit but instead just made in really small quantities to create a sort of buzz but when Lamborghini gets involved that changes a little this is the $900 redmi Champion Edition and bear in mind $900 is a pretty Monumental cost for a company who sells most of their phones at like 400 or less the Sim ejector is a little Bland but I like the carbon fiber style backing oh and the case is nice
too if I had to guess I would say that car company cases are like the most faked type of case so it's called to see an official one which is designed to have the same finish as a steering wheel apparently I've just realized even all the pull tabs are also custom shaped to match Lamborghini's sharp design language there's a charger underneath also branded and 120 WS it's very nippy then the smartphone and the cable beneath that oh oh wow now to be completely real with you I personally find Lamborghini cars
pretty disappointing I don't own one hell no but I've done these like driving experiences and every time I do one I'm constantly surprised at how poor the technology is within what's meant to be a super car like genuinely a Hyundai at a 20th of the price has better Tech that said the Aesthetics of Lamborghinis are Dro worthy and this seems seems to be mostly borrowing that which makes it in my books the nicest looking and feeling redmi phone I have ever held in my hands and the actual Lamborghini logo looks
like real gold even though it probably isn't there's so much detail in the top section and then the bottom section mirrors that same Lamborghini style Chevron but even the lanyard has the same Chevron and then you use that Chevron to place it within the case so that when the phone is on top of it the lanyard completely supports its weight pretty neat brand integration it's literally you versus the guy she   wa I see the appeal of that I guess you could also say that this has Lambo
performance too this might genuinely be the most spec out phone I've ever held in my hands Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip 24 GB of lpddr 5x Ram 1 terab of ufs 4.0 "storage 5,000 mAh battery 120 w super" fast charging some part of me is thinking should I switch to this It also "says the display goes up to 4,000 nits" of brightness my s24 ultra is rated at "2,600 although I wouldn't take that to" mean that this display is 40% Brighter Than This display it's basically just because the way that Peak brightness
numbers are measured can be very specific use case so you can't apply those numbers to the general use of the phone the software skin is actually kind of cool everything is hexagonal but at the same time how did not one person involved in this look at this weather widget and think yeah maybe just at the very least let's not include that on the default home screen I'm kind of curious how do the cameras on this compared to the cameras on my phone if they are actually better than I might just do
this let's give it a go I'm actually not sure tell you what I'm going to put these two images on screen you guys tell me which one you think is better maybe I will switch now just before we get to the biggest limited edition thing that I've ever opened let's take a look at the most expensive phone so you saw the $900 Lamborghini phone right but what can Porsche cook up with honor for over three times that price you can really tell that you're opening something expensive This Time Around by the sheer
volume of packaging oh they couldn't have made a non-stick label seriously honor okay we're in so this is a stylus I do appreciate how it's included in the Box it makes a big difference when an accessory is the default option but wow does this company not know how to use sticky the phone feels really really light but we'll get to that oh three boxes underneath I like the look of this middle one so that is a Porsche Design Sim ejector and inside is a beautiful looking case yes please looks like the
same stitching that you get in the seats of a Porsche what's this I think it's a pen case wow it really is beautiful though it's really hard to communicate the quality to through the camera but it feels designer also pretty slick how every single accessory so far is matte black I I feel like I'm unboxing a full in theme EDC kit even these throwaway inserts they're not like plain cardboard texture it feels like the real deal okay the cable is pretty standard and the charger oh my God that's three times now
it's definitely not me but yeah the Charger looks pretty basic too so what's in here oh it's the same thing so cable and then power brick Oh but this one's a UK power brick instead of Euro well there are definitely much more efficient ways to give you both options but hey I "guess at $3,000 they just do not care" they're just pretty happy to throw stuff at you four times four times honor what are you doing so this is the iconic Porsche fly line this kind of swooshing Ridge
shape that you get along the panels of their cars the camera module is designed to look like a Porsche windshield and the color is Porsche's Agate gray I mean I can kind of buy it like if you're a real fan of their cars then seeing that exact shade of gray on their phone maybe but to me gray is just Gray you'd really have to know to know and this iconic fly line they talk up so much it doesn't really look much different to the ridge on the Lamborghini phone or really any
other Ridge I've seen it all just feels a little bit trivial it's like we partnered with legendary carmaker Porsche to create a crease on the back of our phone that said the design is not just for show this phone as well as titanium lettering in the camera also has a super light titanium hinge and to give them credit it is shockingly slim and light this is 234 G that's less than the weight of an iPhone 14 pro Max but that is wild for a folding phone with literally two times the screen area and
this software skin actually feels very sophisticated compared to the ones we've tested before they haven't themed every single icon but because the theming itself is so subtle it doesn't look like a mess also both screens just generally look and feel really responsive and bright and colorful the stylus feels amazing it's actually quite nice cuz it's got a rubberized tip and I've been really used to using the apple pencil and every time you touch the screen with that it feels like you're hitting it I
got to hand it to them it's a really polished system and I love the fact that the pen works on both the inner screen and the outer screen you know this is actually the first time I'm using a stylist that I genuinely think Rivals the iPad with the apple pencil only thing is because of this rubberized tip it actually creates a little bit of resistance when you're writing so you have to push a little bit harder but this is a sports car class fiberglass body which is cool in that fiberglass is
much stronger than normal glass but at the same time fiberglass is basically just reinforced plastic so I wonder if it actually scratches easier I hate the fact that I have to do this I bought this with my own money but science sometimes I am my own biggest problem so what we want is Mo's hardness pick level six because this will do basically nothing to the back of iPhone's glass but now let's try the Porsche Design well why am I like this why am I like this yeah that's pretty rough oh no I
wanted it to survive that well okay now we're at it even the screen is meant to be something quite different this is Honor's antiscratch nanoc Crystal Shield they're basically saying that partly thanks to a film of silicon nitride which fittingly is actually a material used in real car engines this will stay as good as new even without a protective film with 10 times more wear and drop existant versus competitors which I mean if they actually deliver on that is like all I've ever been asking for on a phone
so let's flip them over right so we'll start with level seven this time so on the iPhone doesn't really do much to be honest okay so now the honor oh okay nothing at all so let's try level eight so far I haven't used a single phone that hasn't been damaged by level eight so iPhone yikes okay that carved right through it  honor okay okay there is damage but it's quite a bit lighter than it was on the iPhone so I guess silicum nitroid works we got to see more companies trying this
oh yeah there's one thing this phone can apparently do that I've been really wanting to try it's meant to be able to detect motion and capture automatically I pop this up here and then let's see I just jump in the air it literally captured me toppling over at the end I think the feature needs some work I think this is such an interesting limited edition though 9 out of 10 time for the big boy box this is something we've never seen before on this series a limited edition fullon gaming PC so this is based off
evangelion's unit 2 Evangelion is a show all about people piloting meccas to defeat enemies who threaten Humanity called angels and this Mecca is piloted by one of the main characters Asuka wow I don't even know where to start I feel like very few people get to actually go Hands-On with something like this you can see Rog branding across the sides because this was actually made in collaboration between Asus Republic of Gamers and overclockers UK and I just can't quite believe the quality of
finish this is cool Tech but also the really cool thing about having a custom gaming PC is it's not just the PC C it's like everything on the inside like I'm just peeking my head in but I can already see so many references to evangelon to Asuka to her specific Mecca W it looks like a crystal etched LED lit kind of backing they've done the entire power supply enclosure the graphics card the graphics card itself is custom evangelon this is one of the coolest pieces of Technology I've ever
interacted with but also when have you ever seen a CPU coer with an actual LCD display on it so it's giving you all sorts of different system readings like CPU temperature GPU temperature the current clock speed as well I mean in a way it's incredibly pointless because all of these stats are already communicated internally anyway but you can also use the screen to display an infinitely looping GIF I'm just putting that out there not that I have any plans of what I would infinitely
Loop I've also never seen a power supply that actively in real time displays the current wattage being supplied also 188 Watts for an idle PC is quite a large amount I feel like can't look at a single part of this PC and not see a reference to the show like even the back plate over here reminds me of the metal armor plating of the mecca oh yeah they've also braided every single cable red and black it's also actually wild how girthy graphics cards become like this GPU Riser here I'm pretty sure is
the only thing keeping this upright it even extends to the outside of the case this is a magnetically attachable external Wi-Fi antenna for the Wi-Fi 6E that it has but let's see what it can do because the specs are redonkulous like I'm talking 14th gen Intel Core I9 with a boost speed of up to 6 GHz 32 gigs of ddr5 RAM 2 tbte M2 mvme SSD oh yeah and the custom Nvidia GeForce RTX 490 graphics card this is the creme DOA Creme of current gen performance okay so we're in cyberpunk
2077 and this is a fun bit because I'm not going to go low medium high or Ultra I am going to go into overdrive wow those fans really work I wonder what the wattage is right now 643 WTS haven't even clicked play yet holy cow oh this this is something else it's like like I've seen really impressive graphics on games before but this is like that but then with another cinematic layer on top it's got really high quality motion blur like every time I run I feel like in one of those high
octane fight sequences but also the lighting everything has this really subtle soft glow I've never actually played cyberpunk myself cuz the bugs would apparently so bad but this really makes me want to give it a shot the fact that I can crank the settings to these kinds of levels and not even worry about performance wow I hope you found this as cool as I did I'll link you to the next rarest Tech video around there see you there
