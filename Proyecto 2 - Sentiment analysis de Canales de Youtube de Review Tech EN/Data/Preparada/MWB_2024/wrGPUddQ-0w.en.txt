these are the new sound core space one Pro headphones and there's five things they've done with them that just make too much sense so first up fold fold this is how you carry them thanks to the company's own flexi curve structure and then this is how they fit into the case which the company is currently giving for free with them this is the best battery life that I've ever seen like just guess how much you get out of 5 minutes of charging half an hour an hour nope 8 hours and then when they're fully
charged you get 40 hours and that's with noise cancellation on as soon as you turn that off 60 hours that noise cancellation you might know that topend headphones use microphones to listen to the surrounding noise and then send out the opposite sound wave to neutralize it these have six microphones to do that with and very good noise cancellation because of it and five these are like a pillow on your head thanks to the slow rebound firm they're constructed with Amazon Link in the description
