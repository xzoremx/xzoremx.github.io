check this out if I type in 5 + 5 / 5 on my phone it tells me the answer is 6 if I do that exact same calculation on an actual calculator 5 + 5 / 5 tells me that it's 2 so how on Earth is that possible and which one of them is wrong well when you use a more typical calculator like this the operations are performed from left to right regardless of what you're actually doing so it'll start with the first part of that sum so it will do the 5 + 5 to get you a 10 and then it will do the second part of that
sum which is divided by 5 so 10 ID 5 gives you 2 your phone calculator though instead follows the order of operations known as bodmas which basically means that all the divisions and the multiplications have to happen before all the additions and the subtractions so when I do 5 + 5 / 5 it's actually doing the 5 / 5 first which gives you a one and then it's plus the five onto that one which gives you the six and because bod mass is generally considered to be the correct way of Performing
these calculations in the Battle of phone versus calculator phone wins
