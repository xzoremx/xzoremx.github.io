"I about to spend $20,000 in the next 5" minutes buying the most minimalist Tech on the planet so that we can find out if it actually does turn your life into a Zen Paradise or if it's all just a fancy way of charging you extra for stuff that actually does less minimalist laptop the HP Spectre fold it seems like it transforms into so many different form factors it's a laptop that's all screen what about the most minimalist TV what on Earth is this the LG easel TV oh it's
transformed between two different states when you see it in images like this it's definitely the kind of vibe I had in mind "5,899 wait LG does a briefcase it's a" 27in touchscreen a cinema experience wherever you go is that a dumb idea or is that a really intelligent idea well I am having a whale of a time here LG has a table that is also an air purifier I mean this is absolutely beautiful oh it has color options no no they have board ape versions of their hyper minimalist Arrow Furniture oh God
that is awful I'm going to pretend that doesn't exist I'm just going to buy the white one okay let's get something non LG that would be good phone oh God that looks awful it looks like a remote for your thermostat the Light phone 2 oh their website is uh kind of naughty definitely sells you on that vision of being completely unplugged it will never have social media clickbait news email an internet browser or any other anxiety inducing infinite feed it's strange isn't it we're living in an age where
products are actively boasting about all the things they don't do I mean is this such thing as a minimalistic gaming console oh the play dat it's a tiny new handheld gaming system with a bunch of brand new games also every game is custom made for the playd are they just going to be like really basic you kind of assume that when it's got a black and white screen I'm not sold on this but I also think there was enough hype around the launch of it that it feels wrong to just write it off we should try it let's
do minimalist speakers audio is always my favorite part of these videos the Samsung Music frame a speaker that blends in beautifully with your home designed to look just like a picture frame does look incredibly clean so it looks like bang and olivon is pretty big in this space Oh this is interesting they're picturing it in a bookshelf next to books and it's smaller than them fits in anywhere and reaches you everywhere in the room with full range Ultra wide sound that's a claim that we have to
test let's see what the cleanest record player is the wheel to plays records from the back so all the technology is sitting underneath the record and that's all you see that is minimalistic it looks like they've compacted so much technology that should take up so much space into a tiny little piece but it still does the same thing if not more that's true minimalism at least that's what I tell Ria boy oh the company actually has different tiers they've got the white wheel and then the black wheel
we reserve time to hand build just 5 to 10 of these per month this is so unbelievably exclusive kitchen gadgets oh there's balmuda products balmuda makes a teapot lightweight and perfectly sized doesn't need to be any bigger they also do a toaster which we already have and then the Brew which is coffee oh wow so this is apparently the temperatures that all the different steps of making coffee have to occur at for the scientifically perfect coffee that is a lot more than your typical mispro
machine xiaomi makes a smart cooking robot your master that allows you to effortlessly enjoy a variety of delicious foods where has this been my whole life it's basically saying that it can do all of your kitchen functions in one machine yeah if we're saying the entire purpose of minimalism is to get as many functions as possible into one device I think we have a winner oh Yanko design completely forgot about this site but I've realized this is literally what this video is and I definitely should
have just started with it eliminate the middle man and eat on the very thing you cooked your food on this is speaking to my soul there's a battery free Aroma diffuser o it just looks so tactile and satisfying and then there's a spork that looks terrible oh yeah Zero Tolerance Machining desk toys it's basically toys that are so precisely cut that you can't actually see the seams like when you put them together it will just look like one continuous object $100 though is nutty for a tiny little
toy the pack it's actually really funny like 50% of minimalist products are just named the something like yes we get it you're very cool and efficient with your words oh my god look how it opens that is cool Final thing will just be if there's any kind of minimalist workout equipment the R2 hot sail wa it's a treadmill that's well I guess literally just the treadmill that is absolutely awesome and it folds so you just tuck it away when you're not using it why are they giving me a kiss well
the product looks good so that's the important thing oh the except PayPal good just on the off chance I get scammed hey that's probably Fair 9 days is how long all of this stuff took to arrive so I mean even the wait times are minimal oh and also we have found the most peaceful property ever to film this in it's very exciting come let me show you so let's go roughly from least expensive to most expensive starting at $70 with the frying plate which is either genius or terrible and I
haven't worked out which yet okay not a great first impression are those oil marks now in theory this is very me I am so the kind of person who would give up some eating Comfort to be able to have less washing up to do wow these are going to be some oily eggs but see there's two things that would normally stop me from eating my meals directly from a pan one because I might burn myself or the table that I'm eating from but also two that by stabbing it with a fork there's a very good chance that I
am actually taking off the non-stick coating and eating it so this is uncoated for that reason but then then does that make it a terrible pan okay so even without a non-stick coating it is actually pretty non-stick the edges of the egg do need a little bit of prying but then this is the key feature so with one hand I should be able to slide that back and take it off that's my plate and I'm slightly scared that it's going to be like "1,000Â° yeah that's boiling hot that" could well burn through any normal
surface that you would eat your food on so already that's a big problem right you need well in my case oven mitt don't like the sounds it makes but it's the eating practicality that I have the problem with because permanently having to approach your plate from this angle just so you don't sear through your entire arm it does slightly cut into the enjoyment of your food plus also this basically only works if you're one person cooking for one person so three out of 10 rough start the zero tolerance
Machining toy kind of fascinates me I mean the idea of paying nearly $100 for a fidget device feels crazy to me so what on Earth could it possibly do that makes it worth that I mean from from a technical perspective this is quite impressive when these two parts do slot together the seam does actually basically disappear and to create something with zero gaps like this you can't just use a traditional Toy Factory like this piece wasn't cut with a blade because the blade itself would create
its own Gap what you effectively have to do is to vaporize the space in between these two pieces using the heat generated from Rapid electrical discharges okay but then as something that you actually having to spend your hard earned money on I'm not going to lie I find this whole category of executive desk toys just a little bit cringe like the idea of these highflying business people who earn so much money that they can't just play with normal toys and they in fact have to spend $100
on something with the same entertainment value as an empty bag of crisps and this is actually the other part of the problem because this thing is so precisely machined once this piece comes out it is stupidly hard to get it back into place genuinely only goes in if you precisely match the direction of the Grain on both parts and then does let me and I stop it earning money because I'm spending all my time trying to put my fidget toy back together I think it actually has to be a zero out of 10
technically buy their own admission I'm much more hopeful about the play date I fully remember when this thing launched and people all over Twitter went pretty Bonkers over it it's this very strange blend of retro gaming console but instead of being made with cheap creaky plastic like most consoles are premium Hardware oh yeah and a crank wait this thing's tiny this is definitely among the smallest mobile devices I've ever used whoever was posing in the photos on the website has extremely small hands also
the crank actually tucks into the body of the device that's pretty cool engineering you know when I first saw this thing I thought this was how you charge up the device I'm actually very glad that's not the case that would be a nightmare this is actually one of your controls to be able to play games with I will say it is a very pretty piece of tech surprisingly so the buttons feel really satisfying the screen is only black and white it gets noticeably more readable as I tilt it up toward WS the
light but anyway the most important question on my mind is is it fun okay so the UI is definitely much more responsive than you expect it to be based on how the thing looks does feel like it's running at a full 60 frames per second yeah it's got really smooth animations but really retr Graphics so it's got this weird past meets future vibe to it I don't know how I feel about this crank to be honest like I totally respect the need to be different but it's just making my hands ache and I
can't imagine this being the way that I want to play games on like a long airplane in flight for example and let's try casual burer oh this is really weird it turns your device into a camera and then you use the crank to focus that camera so I'm unfocused and then I'm focused one thing this unique control scheme means is that you're definitely not playing games you've ever played before this isn't like a retro emulation device but I just I don't think it's for me so there's
only two games on here right now but the way this works which is actually quite cool to be fair is they stagger them so they give you two games every week for the first 12 weeks of owning it and that's all included with the price I guess they stagger it to let you appreciate each game before giving you the next one but it's just playing on something like this really makes me realize that me personally I actually don't want minimalism in my games I want more buttons I want more power or
failing that just multiplayer and I think for more people something like the Miu Mini Plus has much more appeal so this is something I only found out about a couple of weeks and when you boot it up it is basically every single retro console and then you click into one let's say the PS1 and there are so many games it is just nutty uh one of my  racing the shoulder buttons on the back it is genuinely the entire PlayStation 1 experience and I'm not even super sold on this I'd still rather play something
like the Nintendo switch with its modern games but I see it I see the Merit of something like this whereas I really struggle to see the Merit of this the battery scent diffuser is well I guess it's the minimum required Tech to achieve diffusion I got to say I am very much enjoying the unboxing experiences so far I guess it is one thing that you can bet on Minimalist designled companies definitely getting right it's quite nice to see a product that isn't actually over engineered like this uses
really simple physics to the point where you can actually see the entire process in action so essential oil goes in the back here obviously I picked eucalyptus it's the only right choice oil goes behind the fan you light the candle and then essentially this glass tube is going to direct as much of the heat energy from that candle onto this steel surface at the top and then hopefully that heat energy is going to be transferred over towards the fan which can use it to then start turning and
diffuse those oils around your room I saw twinges of movement oh oh look at it oh my God that is beautiful there's something so elegant about the fact that there's no batteries there's no cables I made that happen with this little candle the only question then is is this all theatrics or is this actually better than sticking oil in a candle and just lighting it okay so let's stick this in one of the rooms like that oh it really is pretty and then in room number two it's going to be just the candle and I'm
literally just going to pour drops of oil on top of it and what the other diffuser was saying is that doing it this way would cause the essential oils to burn and therefore not actually preserve their scent let's come back to it and find out moving up to $300 now for this price you can actually replace your phone with a minimalist equivalent so this is the light phone 2 that we bought and again like the play dat the thing's microscopic but unlike a lot of the products so far which could just
neatly fit into your existing lifestyle switching your phone is a big commitment so what can this do it can text okay oh you have to type sideways I guess they've decided that that's the only way you can comfortably type on a screen like this and it's not too bad it's a little bit less responsive than you're probably used to and the autocorrect kind of suckss it connect as a Wi-Fi hotspot it's got Bluetooth it's got a headphone jack on the top so it's got your music covered it does say it has
directions what does that even look like on a phone like this God this is so clunky you have to keep rotating it every single time it's pretty slow by the way it's acting you'd think I just asked it to solve physics not ask for walking directions oh but it does give you some semblance of Google Maps I assume it is not a good way to use it though Cy cuz this is an e Inc screen screen so it doesn't have smooth animations it has to reender every single thing on screen every time it
changes but this will be fun let's see what the call Quality is like oh yeah here's another problem I was just about to call my mom but she's in India right now so I would have normally WhatsApp called her there is no WhatsApp here Dom oh hi Domino we're big fans could we get some pepperoni pizza yeah okay it's functional for calls it does have a speaker phone it's not particularly loud now we got some pizzas on the way I'm slightly torn with devices like this because I see the
appeal you know a phone that weighs nothing it could disappear within your pockets plus it does seem to be getting quite a few software updates from what I can see it's just that for most people I don't think it does quite enough to replace your smartphone like you can't browse the internet and the music yes it has a headphone jack but you can only use it if you're willing to manually upload your songs one by one to the Light phone dashboard there's no Spotify there's no apps apart from the super
basic calculator alarm and maps that doesn't really work very well as a map I just feel like if you actually wanted to properly switch off how is this any better than just a Nokia brick phone it's not like you're getting Cutting Edge Hardware that still makes it feel like a modern smartphone I mean the last time they made a new model of this was 2018 and then if you don't want to completely switch away from your phone but you just want to dial down the amount you use it there are so many
minimalist apps now that can actually just restrict what you can and can't do but just to a sensible level instead of downgrading so hard that you might not actually be able to contact someone that you need to feels like a 4 out of 10 to me now I still can't quite believe I'm saying this but what costs even more than a phone well the teapot no really we spent $300 on the balmuda teapot it is cheaper in the us but we get slightly screwed here in the UK so this really better be the best teaing experience
I've ever had now there's a couple of problems that they're claiming to have fixed here compared to a normal peasant kle one is the design and and yeah I mean it's pretty hard to argue with that one this is our $10 Kettle and compared to that this definitely has a much nicer stone-like finish everything snaps into place in quite a tactile way that feels very secure and also the fact that I feel like I could rub this for a little bit and get three wishes and while obviously no one needs a pretty Kettle
no one needs a neon tube filament style bulb as your indicator I can see why people would want one on on now there's a lot of people and I am one of these people who really enjoy the ritual of making tea and coffee it's the slow grinding the gentle pouring the sights the smells The Sounds it's an experience and I think this is designed for someone who appreciates that that one is kicking off right now I feel like relative to it it makes the balmuda sound silent oh wait what that one
finished barmuda hasn't finished that's hilarious I feel like this is one of those things where the cheap kettle has one purpose and that's to get to the destination as fast as possible and it does that but this is actually almost concerningly quiet now the second perk of this is apparently the fact that it's got less capacity than most kettles which is a strange thing to label as one of your headline features less capacity for your benefit now if I had to guess I would say that took twice as long as the
other Kettle which if you look at the spec sheet is inexcusable for something this expensive so so far this is not exactly a strong case for the baluda but there is one thing that might be able to save it unprecedented pouring Comfort was across the website so let's find out that's basically laminar flow or in other words the gooseneck shape of the kettle allows water to come out so smoothly that it acts like a still object and it's completely silent okay yeah that's earned back a couple of
points that felt pretty good I have to say it's still absolutely not forever on but for the people who appreciate it I'd give that a seven okay let's see if the scent diffusion actually worked start with my hodg Podge version uh I can smell a hint of eucalyptus but if you told me that no eucalyptus was here I would also believe you okay now for the Fancy Pants leay  diffuser oh that's that's quite immediate I can notice it it's not a massively strong eucalyptus smell but it's almost got this smokiness to it
it's definitely made more of an impact to this room than the candle alone which if you combine with how obscenely aesthetic it is to look at I think earns it a nine one thing with balmuda they are a Japanese company so it's pretty hard to get their stuff here and that seems to be a bit of a theme with high-end minimalist Tech cuz LG's Aero Furniture range as well is Hong Kong and Singapore only maybe there's just more demand for minimalism in East Asian countries I don't know why though
because in concept I feel like this could be useful for anyone like I have a ton of allergies and they are constantly working together to keep my nose at 99% congestion throughout my sleep so I have one of these massive filters in my room just sucking out those and the dust I think a lot of people could benefit from filters and I think they just don't use them because they admittedly do look like monolithic garbage cans but this so you can order pizza on your light phone too what am I doing sorry I
was saying this is a table this is the entire purpose so it's got a fulls size heer filter inside that's good need to make sure I actually unbag it before I start using the filter it's got vents all around actually to take in particles from 360Â° which is also a plus Point there's also funnily enough in this box here a UV light that kills bacteria on the fan blades so whether or not the air coming in is clean you can be sure that the air coming out is clean one thing we need to test is how loud is the thing
okay so there's different fan speeds here all the controls are on the bottom as well which makes a lot of sense given that it's meant to be a table so that's at maximum it's pretty loud but that's okay you actually want your purifier to be able to go high what I'm more interested in is what would be the average normal operating volume volume wait is this still on yeah it's definitely on but all you have to do is to move one foot away from it and it's pin drop silence I don't actually have a
pin to test that but one thing you can rely on me always having is a Sim  tool I heard that oh yeah and this is also a wireless charger which is telling me 1 hour 24 until I'm back to Max battery so it's not the fastest kind of wireless charger but it's also not the slowest oh and also there is actually a ring of mood lighting underneath I mean as much as I don't love the idea of having a whole extra app that I need to control the ACT lighting itself transitions very smoothly although the
app is a little bit slow and I suppose the other probably more underrated benefit is that if you turn up the setting it's actually just a fan too it's actually kind of refreshing to stick in my hand here it's getting a very strong 9 out of 10 n out of 10 that could have been worse at $400 then or the equivalent of 625 if you're in the UK you seeing a theme Here is Samsung's brand new frame speakers now I'm not personally someone who Minds the way that speakers normally look but I can also see the appeal of
what's effectively promising invisible sell so we can actually put the easel TV where I'm sitting when we get to that but for now let's focus on this so first impressions extremely heavy bigger than I was expecting and also thicker than I was expecting it's also a little disappointing that this is literally just paper you know when I first saw it on the website I thought oh maybe it's a a screen that will allow you to put anything on it or at the very least like a backlight so that it brightens up your
image it means that really there is no Tech here apart from the speaker which just means it's a very expensive speaker and it needs to prove itself but one of the more appealing parts of this is I should be able to play music and then  somewhere the app is telling me to press the volume down button I am pressing the volume down button oh something went wrong yeah this is just not working and the app sucks I think we're just going to have to do this over Bluetooth just to hear the sound quality if nothing
else oh there we go so one's working and I think we're just going to have to take it as is let's see how it sounds around the room so one thing it does really well is the volume fall off is not high at all it sounds almost as loud here as it did when I was sitting right next to it but the sound is it's just okay it's good amateur sound but you're not hearing those glistening high notes that you might on higher end speakers but there is one thing that I am very interested
to test so on Samsung's website one of the things they said about these speakers is they have ai enhancement technology to make voices sound better and I know most of these AI features are just marketing bliff but this one is interesting because I've been listening to a lot of high-end Hi-Fi sound systems over the last few weeks and one of the things you notice is it doesn't actually matter how high-end those sound systems get if the track being listened to is not recorded in the perfect environment
which you come to realize is most of them then it's not going to sound good even on the best speaker system but a speaker that uses AI to actually enhance the Basse recording well that could get around that bottleneck yeah I mean it's okay it's fine it's nothing the way I would put it is if you absolutely want a set of loud Bassy speakers and they absolutely have to be invisible then maybe this is the way to go but for the vast majority of people you can do better with something else
but now we're getting to the real juicy stuff grish and I have actually been trying to put together the perfect 3-day getaway bag for years now so our bag that comes in a bag couldn't have come sooner please be good please be good please be good uh initial Impressions not the best so this is ballistic nylon on the outside and then this is Rip stop Nyon on the inside it's the kind of material that you get on those extreme outdoor clothes and while it might well make it
very durable we're going to test that in a little bit what it does not do is make it feel plush and comfortable and luxurious not helped by the fact that none of the tape actually came off properly and is still very much stuck onto the bag it feels like this really weird mix of ultra futuristic design I mean like look how the thing opens when do you ever see that with some very cheap plasticky mechanisms that don't actually give me any confidence in how it's going to hold up in the long term
okay so this is the dedicated sunglasses area I love the idea of this but then there's no safeguards in place which means that if I just like tip the bag upside down and try and open it now yeah look doesn't open properly there's quite a few well positioned Pockets so there's one here which is a nice one for passports there's one down here for something you don't want other people to find and then this is quite cool they've actually carved out a physical area for bottles but then
covered it with a stretchy fabric so it looks flush when there's nothing in it but then if I put the drink in it kind of Nestles itself around it which is pretty neat you absolutely cannot knock the fact that there are lots of cool ideas going on here even just the fact that they advertise this as being a dock for your laptop open it first and then you probably need something to lean on but even if I had that it's like a it's like a vertical work setup this is not how I would
choose to use my machine and then you're also banking your entire laptop's health and safety on some very unassured foundations but the durability feels like it's meant to be the biggest selling point so sunglasses play dat put some clothing and a notebook in the main pocket and then in place of my MacBook a plank of glass just because I've been burned very recently literally 2 weeks ago I dropped my actual MacBook while it was in a bag that I don't think is nearly as secure as this so the entire
hinge is now misaligned and it's extremely sad lock it up and then this right here is a double lock they call it the two- Factor authentication and it does kind of work but it's another one of those things where if it's halfway along you can actually still open the bag so I wouldn't trust it with anything all right let's put it on ooh okay couple of things actually so the straps feel like memory foam they're actually pretty nice as far as scraps go and one thing the bag is doing quite well is
taking a lot of the weight off my shoulders like this doesn't feel nearly as heavy as it should considering how much stuff is in it and now we see what it's made of three 2 one oh God but you saw that I mean the mechanism just opened by itself so the sunglasses they're okay the plank of glass yep that's intact the play dat alive and well and the light phone just about working as well as light phones do so I think the bag has earned the right to be able to say that it can protect
your stuff in the short term but it's just I have severe doubts about the long term like technically during this drop the bag was locked it kind of feels like the definition of a five out of 10 products so we've made the perfect balmuda tea already but now it's time for the coffee experience which is much more involved and hopefully much more rewarding now to give you a little bit of context I love coffee I'm just I'm just a little bit basic with it I either have an instant coffee at home because
it's quick or if I'm out I'll go to Starbucks because they have nice places to sit I've never sprung for something like this cuz I've always just assumed it would be too much work for not enough payoff but then this is really interesting because can this change my mind I really like how it tells you exactly what size cup of coffee you're going to get with the amount of water you put in smart design Bara goes in  funnel I do like how all the pieces don't just fall into place they snap in
place and also how this will not actually start making coffee until all of these pieces are in position oh I love how simple it is I guess it makes a lot of sense cuz you'd be doing this before you've had your coffee okay so it's going to start by I see him heating up the water I think that's the same sound effect that the toaster uses when it's cooking your bread it's good that it's simple because it's definitely very easy at this Enthusiast grade price for it to not be like we're talking
something that can distribute water with a Precision of 0.2 ml so this right here is meant to mimic a trained barista's poro the technique you know the way the water has this kind of soft pter patter on the coffee I can definitely see the appeal of waking up to that in the morning I could also see something quite nice about going off and doing your work at this moment and then just leaving it to finish making your coffee but just listening and smelling okay so the first
part of the process is now finishing and what it's doing at this point is this is called bypass pouring it's basically a completely separate stream of finishing water that's added directly into the serving carf on one hand it does seem just like much ad do about nothing but it's all about temperature control of the coffee beans getting the beans hot enough to be able to get the best flavor out of them without getting them so hot that you burn them which according to balmuda happens at 187Â° F let's do a
quick instant coffee for a comparison y That's What I drink every morning see what it looks like oh interesting it's distinctly smoother looking like almost much purer than the muddiness of the instant coffee oh it's got the entire flavor of the coffee and it's really strong and Rich but then it suddenly cuts it cuts before the the bitterness hits and my brain's almost expecting that bitterness to come in but it doesn't so you don't drink black coffee at all see if this is
drinkable for you a little bit fruity with a little bit of sugar that is actually really nice okay I mean as far as the experience and the flavor of the coffee goes this is an outstanding product the only thing on my mind is this is going to be a fair bit of work washing up because it's going straight to the caraffe and not into the cup that you're going to be drinking from you've got to wash this you've got to wash this and there's no bean grinder here so there's going to be a whole extra
separate piece of equipment that you also have to buy and maintain I'm going to give it a nine it's folding treadmill time but while this thing did look absolutely Bonkers minimalistic in the photos I do have some concerns about the practicality so the thing is quite a bit bulkier than it looked on the website but to be fair it's got wheels and the wheels actually make the transportation job not a problem feels like it's got some pretty solid latches to hold everything in place and then I assume 
into okay oh yeah so one thing they were very careful to uh minimize was the size of this thick boy cable that you have to plug in at all times it definitely does make it a little bit less clean but then again to be fair considering that we currently have a treadmill sitting in our living room right now it could be a lot worse so this thing goes up to 6 km/ hour in Walking mode and then up to 12 km/ hour in a separate running mode which actually makes quite a lot of sense because you wouldn't want to be on
walking mode without your handlebars and suddenly accidentally reach 12 km/ hour and what I'm on right now is apparently automatic walking mode so it's actually working out how fast I'm walking and making sure the treadmill is exactly ready for my steps so let me try the fastest steps I can and it's creeping up in speed okay yeah it's at 6 km I maxed it out so what if I now try and slow down this is the scary part oh my God no I don't think it's adapting quite fast enough it's splitting the treadmill into
three zones the front the middle and the back if it detects that your feet are often hitting the front it knows that you want to go faster and if it detects you're spending a lot of time on the back it knows you need to slow down so it'll probably take a little bit of getting used to to know exactly where each Zone starts and ends but there's a definite safety problem here unless of course you use the handlebars but then does that slightly defeat the minimalism and now feels like a pretty
good time for the TV what have we done oh yeah the box was about two times the already massive size I was expecting it to be I'm pretty sure this is the biggest thing I've ever unboxed and yes I spent 10 minutes getting through the entire packaging only to realize that I unboxed it all upside down so yay me although one cool thing is because this comes with the cover off you get to see the insides of a TV speaker system so that's pretty neat okay I think that's on but more importantly what on Earth does a 
do okay that's cool feel like I'm walking down into the basement Hotel Spar well part of it is the style this is designed to look and prop up against your wall kind of like an easel but I'm just trying to decide right now if that actually makes any sense I will give it this the TV actually does look a lot prettier than I was expecting it to and the screen quality the color saturation it's all beautiful it's just why do I want a TV that persistently looks like it's one light Breeze away from serious
Collateral Damage I mean technically it won't be because LG actually recommends that even when it's in this slanted position it's actually drilled into the wall but then at that point why does it need to be an easel from everything we've seen so far there is no functional benefit to having this as opposed to just wall mounting your TV but there is one thing that could change that so when you turn the TV off it's going to enter what they call line View mode so this is taking advantage of the
fact that you technically have a scalable amount of screen on show this is your TVs always on display effectively but what I'm curious about is how much you can customize it oh that's funky and then you can also display those in front of some interesting looking architectural wallpapers is this just a grand waste of electricity then it also gives you the option for music oh that's quite a neat way to actually display music in your house there's cool ideas here there's no
doubt about that but I just can't shake the feeling that this is basically a slightly worse version of rollable TVs that completely disappear when you're done with them I see it as a product that's trying to be a clear part of the Smart Home you know this kind of piece of furniture that's a little bit alive it's a pretty tough product to rate because it is a spectacle and if you like it you can't get that anywhere else but as far as the core value for money proposition it's basically like a 2
Grand TV with a funky transforming mechanism that makes it 7 and 1/2 Grand so on that scale it's a 6 out of 10 now as for the treadmill I'm quite impressed with how quiet it is like this is me running at 8 km per hour and you don't hear it that much thanks to the brushless motor on the inside it's really neat design and love that it's got wheels I love that it folds up but this sucks and there's a couple of areas here like the massive diagonal scene going across the track where you're
reminded that this is not the highest quality product and like given that this is the structure that my safety tag is attached to you can see there might be a problem there so yeah I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this to someone who wants to do some serious running but if you just want something minimal that can be well minimized and tucked away under your desk when you're done with it there is a decent amount of Merit to it so I'd give it a 7 out of 10 and well speaking of things that have been
minimized the Gap in subscribers between us and apple right now is less than "400,000 and when we overtake them we are" going to build the most maximal iPhone ever created so thank you for helping us we are definitely in the super premium price here at this point definitely where bang and ol ofsome belongs I've not really used any of their stuff over the years primarily because it just always seems to me extraordinarily expensive for what it is like this speaker is literally the dimensions of a
book but I paid the equivalent of "$11,000 for it now we find out if it's" worth it I have to say though it really does feel like it is challenging you to believe that it can't fill the room with high quality sound while promising that it can thanks to active room compensation technology these are configurable buttons so you can pick a song or a playlist that you want to activate when you tap any of them nothing about the shape or the size of this gives me confidence that it's going 
okay it has a thump to it that's for sure there's already something going on there but defies its size let's get up and walk around there's a definite harshness to it there's a definite limitation that you feel compared to a bigger speaker that has a bigger dedicated subwoofer that smacks you with deep bass it's good sound but you're paying to have that sound in the small package if you just want pure audio quality you can do better than that for "$1,000 now I am not the best at cooking"
I'm pretty happy to admit that but that actually makes me the perfect person to test the xiaomi cooking robot cuz well can this save me uh can we also talk about how unbelievably massive this is and why on Earth it needs to come in about 12 separate individually wrapped Parts okay but the key question that we need to answer is while obviously an enormous piece of Kit is this better than the alternative drisha being the alternative so we're both cooking a cheese risoto using the same recipe oh
this is actually pretty cool so when you go into a recipe it tells you the tools you need for it it tells you the ingredients you need for it and then that is the step-by-step guide how did we end up doing it this way where you get the machine and I get the I'm the typ guide so it says add the shredded cheese to the pot first I need a pot this is my pot all right I have a pot so how much cheese do we need 50 g I got a bit too much it is cool that it shows you an image of what your result is
meant to look like and it's already pre- readed the action that I need to press now I just see if it actually works oh wow this is very well shredded cheese so it says add the chopped onion butter and the olive oil to the pot and this is great because in real time it's telling me exactly how many of those grams I have currently put in wo okay so it says cover with a measuring cup and then it's going to rotate and cook it for me oh it's like warm buttery oniony goodness okay so reverse rotation speed one was
it sorry I don't listen to instructions anymore I just let my robot do the talking alert wait I that's just it's saying it's done ooh look at this okay that smells amazing mine doesn't quite smell like that right now so add 320 G of risoto rice this is able to tweak things so minutely like now it's cooking specifically for 1 minute at 100Â° instead of the 120 that it was cooking for before right so then it's one big final cook so start cooking and we'll come back to it you carry on how much
cooking much cooking and while we wait there's something about briefcases isn't there there's something very elusive about people walking to work with a briefcase and a briefcase only I guess they make what's inside seem important and worth protecting but I mean in the case of LG's briefcase you have a very real reason to want to protect it cuz this is a 27in touchscreen LCD monitor and I guess the rest is battery who okay oh my God who so it goes to any height and then also pivots based on the
angle want to look at it from this says Dolby Vision Atmos which means I assume this part is speakers that's a very interesting Prospect the idea of carrying your entire Cinema in one go and I realize it seems incredibly excessive but I can also think of quite a few moments where I've wished that something like this existed like the Nintendo switch for example so many times I've taken this thing to places that don't have an external screen to plug into and so you end up in a situation where you pull out the
kickstand and it's four people crouched around a 7in display okay so what better way to break the screen in than with a quick smash with my arch rival Arch Smasher Joseph oh no no no no no no no no no this is not representative one thing I'll say for absolute certainty there is a massive amount of input lag here probably why you're losing right yeah yeah yeah this is definitely not designed for gaming the screen looks quite impressive from a distance but up close you can absolutely tell that it's
a 1080p panel I'd say it's a pretty respectable audio experience while it is cool that you're getting this allinone experience experience you're paying "$1,200 for it and this is not a $1,200" monitor are you still going R finish him no oh dear now one thing though that might make this a little bit more interesting is home this is LG's home menu and it's not a full-blown Android device it doesn't have access to everything like your phone does but it's pretty good as far as TVs go so it's got
entertainment things like Channel 4 ITV and then also game which is a combination of 10% of games that you'd actually probably quite enjoy and 90% that you wouldn't want to touch with the barge pole we can play a full game of chess obviously we wouldn't be craning this way because we'd be playing it when it's flat it's not a super slick polished experience it's actually the opposite of the play date in a lot of but it's functional if you really want to play a game of chess on a 27in screen
sitting on a beach you can do that but that's actually part of the problem because the website's very strange it says that it has up to 3 hours of battery life and then in the same breath that you can watch movies while on the beach with 3 hours of battery life as an absolute upper limit it's a bit of a stretch to say that you can watch multiple movies there's Netflix there's Prime video there's also though Tik Tok TV and I think yes wow that's a sight when have you ever
seen anyone do this before like I'm not going to lie I do find this really cool but at the same time I feel like if that is what you're going to be using this for you have made a terrible purchase the specific thing that it does that nothing else does it does really well it's just that there aren't many people for who that is for "$3,700 is how much we spent on the black" wheel record player and I know the rational part of my brain keeps telling me records make no sense in today's age
I'm already paying Spotify and tile for my music digitally this record player connects to the same speakers that my phone already connects to and there must be software by now that can make my phone recreate the sound signature of records and yet just like with the tea in the coffee there is something just so alluring about the manual process of slipping out the vinyl of gently sort of placing it on top and then clasping this magnet in place and then you want to know how to turn it on you just Spin and
you will actually see oh my goodness me look at the arm it slowly comes out this is one of the smoothest operating pieces of technology I think I've ever interacted with you can see it edging towards the first track there you go oh so this right here is the volume dial that feel feel so satisfying and I love the way it displays itself using these tiny little LEDs wait but also this record player very clearly understands the tracks within the vinyl I've just placed on it and it's allowing me to
navigate to the exact points in those tracks that I want it's putting my vinyl player at home to shame and the way they've done this interface is so subtle but clever because there's no screen here so all of your information is coming from tiny little LEDs that are lit up to different levels of brightness and you can actually see how the arm is moving across the viney as I navigate and that's a really good thing because you have to control it using this device there's no remotes and I feel like this
is kind of a bit of a theme with these minimal products I came into this video expecting them all to basically be the things that you're used to but easier but it's kind of the opposite they're often actually more manual and less seamless but the perk that I'm noticing is that that manual encourages you to be mindful when using them to really be aware of how the things work and to interact with them in a way that allows you to appreciate them more like I feel like if I listen to music on this I'm
going to listen to that music much more intentionally than if I was just on my Spotify discover weekly there is no doubt in my mind that this is a highly over engineered product like it even goes to the extent of understanding if a vinyl you've placed on there is Warped and then adjusting how it plays that vinyl back accordingly but it's done like that so that you the user you only have to focus on the best parts of the vinyl experience oh yeah I so see it I so see being curled
up next to a fire with a hot tea and a vinyl it's an extremely expensive way almost unnecessarily expensive way to get that experience but for someone who appreciates it this is a product that has no compromise we said to ourselves before filming this video that anything that scores above a nine is coming with us to our new house 9.1 as for what laptop a minimalist would use well I have no regrets about the choice we made I think it's got to be the laptop that's just one completely
seamless uninterrupted screen oh they actually include the keyboard and oh the pen too although the fact that I'm so surprised by this does show how dire things have gotten with modern tech companies okay I mean this 17-in IMAX OLED folding display there's no beating around the bush this is an impressive site to behold so what does that mean this can do well I believe yep that's a kickstand so let's say you get back home and you're parked up on your desk this effectively becomes a 17in all-in-one PC
and I realized 17 in isn't massive in the scheme of monitors but it feels enormous when I'm sitting right here and then the keyboard and the trackpad they automatically pair and they work completely wirelessly and for data day tasks like zipping through documents and stuff it's pretty nippy it's not like uber satisfying to type on cuz you know this is pretty low profile stuff we're talking about but highly functional but then also let's say I want to use this like most people use their normal
laptops this should just yeah it snaps in place on the bottom and can you see the screen actually adapts around where the keyboard fits in wait what that shouldn't have happened never in my lifetime of reviewing Tech okay let me just finish talking about this and then then I'll get to that so what I actually think is really smart is it's not just that the keyboard and the pen magnetically attached to it they also magnetically charge like this so the only thing that you need to worry about topping up is
just the tablet itself I do think there's big benefits to having all your devices as one device like it's so cool that the same machine I can do do all my typing on I can use as a full-size sketch pad to draw out what I want our future office to look like okay let's see what an IMAX video looks like the idea of having a media experience like this just chilling on an airplane is kind of enticing cuz as well as everything else this is fully able to display HDR video funny enough this is
actually banging olison speakers but it's really loud it's only at 30% volume right now oh man I really really really want to like this thing but there are just a few too many problems it's buggy the hinge is not at all strong enough to support what's actually a very heavy top half of screen but then on top of that to achieve a form factor like this compared to a traditional laptop you have to go for a much smaller battery and then because of that you have to go for a much lower power chip oh yeah and
the whole device literally has two USB ports on it I'm trying to load up a game hell div is 2 to show you it's taking so long it's running at about 2 frames per second I mean yeah this is almost definitely the most unplayable experience I've had in recent memory like you know they normally say that the equipment you use is only 10% of the job I don't see any way that you would be able to go online on this thing and not get obliterated as much as I love the idea of this in the end I don't think it
makes much sense because it's only affordable for people willing to pay Pro pricing but people willing to pay Pro pricing who aren't actually themselves Pro because as soon as you try to do anything Pro on it it strangles to a halt 5 out of 10 speaking of which though my internet at home comes from Virgin Media and you know it took me 2 and a half years of being with them for me to realize they've actually been throttling my connection oh my God mine looks amazing okay mine is like looks
like scrumbled egg got a really great consistency and it turns out this is a pretty common thing because I download and stream lots of videos internet providers they can actually without even telling me just reduce how much bandwidth I'm getting so that they can keep everyone's internet connection stable now that might sound incredibly Noble but the only reason that they have to do that is because these companies don't invest enough themselves to be able to give all the customers the
speeds that they're actually paying for but I also realized in the same stroke that the only reason Virgin Media would even know who I was is because my IP address was public so as soon as I masked my IP address with surf shark VPN and I became Anonymous in those High Network traffic times where previously my ISP would have tried to rob me I have sometimes noticed my speed going up and that's just one of a seemingly NeverEnding list of reasons why I subscribe to Surf Shar VPN I don't
enable it all the time but it's just saved my butt so many times that I do not know what I would do without it and with the code boss it is literally Less Than 3 a month for an unlimited number of accounts with an extra 3 months for free and a money back guarantee all right let's go in for the taste test so drisha your risotto is looking a little gloopy I have to say it's quite starchy it feels like the risotto and the sauce have Blended together to become one I'll try the machined one
now I know it's going to sound like I'm just saying it but that is way way better I would give this a four I would give this an eight wow oh go oh that was really good that xiaomi robot is Way Beyond what I was expecting obviously there's a limit to how many recipes you're going to be able to get installed on that but for the ones it has that's an easy 9 out of 10 experience bear in mind I've never made risoto in my life
