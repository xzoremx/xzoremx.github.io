what happens when you try and photocopy money it literally just says the original cannot be copied what so what if we take out the doll note and instead try and photocopy a British pound notes so it says Printing and then just goes straight to cancelling okay so just to make sure the photocopier is working let's see what happens when I put Monopoly money in there copy no way that worked completely fine what is going on here well hidden on this pound note is actually a very specific pattern known
as the urian constellation because of its similarity to the Orion Star constellation you wouldn't particularly notice it on first glance with everything else that's going on with the design but it's this pattern that every single scanner is designed to recognize to specifically stop you from copying money and it's not just the British pound if you look really carefully you can see the same thing in the Euro it's in the dollar but masked even further by using the value of the notes to create
that pattern and then the Japanese yen is absolutely crazy these guys actually hide the pattern within flowers on the Note
