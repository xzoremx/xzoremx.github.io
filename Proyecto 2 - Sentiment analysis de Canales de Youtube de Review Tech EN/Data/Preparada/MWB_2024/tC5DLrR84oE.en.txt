phone cases you didn't know you wanted this is the dice case which is great for board games that require five dice that's actually really cool but just imagine the sound every single time you take a step the aroma therapy case though is even more curious why does this look exactly like an Apple Mac Pro and then this is the aroma diffuser o that's like nice cologne next up is the astronaut case so this visor over here it's two things when it's closed it Shields the cameras when it's
open not horizontal stand for the phone the Supercar case not only looks like a car but also has a built-in spoiler with a retractable stand on the inside and then it's got this lenticular image of a car that looks like it's driving through Easter eggs so this is the anti- drop case so you place your phone inside lid goes on top all right so when you want to use it you slide it up and then you lock it in place and then anytime you're not you basically have an unbreakable device subscribe and I'll
use this for a week
