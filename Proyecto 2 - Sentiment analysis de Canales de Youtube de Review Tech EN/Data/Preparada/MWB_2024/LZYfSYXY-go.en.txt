this is Apple's thinnest ever device and it's absolutely ridiculous it's the seventh generation and Apple's last ever iPod Nano I forgot just how cool these things were and yes Apple even sold an entire collection of tiny socks to store it in so how thin is it 5.4 mm and it still has a headphone jack oh my God it only just fits this is actually such an impressive device it looks like a smartphone it runs like a smartphone it's got 30 hours of battery when listening to music man wouldn't it be so
cool if they made phones like this
