four of the rarest phones ever first up is the Coca-Cola phone it has a special finish designed to match the sheen of a real coke can every time you take a photo you can hear the coke being opened and when you plug it into charge the drink actually comes together the Harry Potter phone though is magical every single part of this unboxing experience is filled with references to the movies like The Marauders map which is actually your manual the phone itself has an embossed Harry Potter logo it has a
glossy Crest it's even got Harry's glasses around the two camera lenses and the wallpaper that's the golden snitch next up is the BMW film yes it actually comes in a car Bonnet that just keeps on giving with posters special coins of the BMW logo through the years and an air compressor and then the phone itself has a custom boot screen a unique icon pack and the BMW logo instead of the home button this one though is on a whole "other level this it's the $10,000 gun" phone it's made of Aerospace grade
titanium the handle of the gun is real wood and the gun itself electroplated gold imagine taking this through airport security
