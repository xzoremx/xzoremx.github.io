this is my dream everyday carry 2024 I've been optimizing this every day for the last year in the background and I think it's finally perfect so let's talk about it so it all starts with the backpack this is the gtic 30 L travel pack I've probably been through 15 backpacks leading up to this one and it is by far the best it's weather resistant so I feel pretty comfortable doing this even when there is a lot of valuable stuff on the inside it distributes weight really well so things
feel lighter than they are but the single biggest thing is I think you'll be absolutely shocked by how much you can fit in here you'll see as I unpack so when you're crafting a perfect everyday carry I think it's important to have some rules these are mine number one every single Gadget charges with USBC number two there are no gimmicks here everything has a function number three function over form but sometimes you can have both and number four dark mode everything just because it looks
cool okay let's start on the outside so in the right hand pocket this is the fagun mini a strangely shaped device that's basically the most powerful massage gun you can get in this compact form factor and of course golden rule number one charges with USBC but there is something else on this side this is an air tag it's in one of these Ultra solid hyper rugged cases and it's got a thick braided metal wire so you shouldn't be able to cut through it but even if you do there's actually a second
hidden air tag within the inner lining of this bag it didn't come with it I put that in but it's a really cool tip that I learned from my good friend technical gury in India that's proper two Factor security so you've got to have a dedicated sunglasses pocket in a bag cuz there's something about sunglasses they just they disappear at the first opportunity and you might be thinking well eron that's a tiny pocket for a pair of sunglasses yes but these are the Rove sunglasses I featured them in my
finnest tech video and they are just so awesome they're basically folding sunglasses but just with the thinnest possible frame and they do not actually feel nearly as flimsy as you'd expect to given that then the other thing in this pocket and by the way they're also felt lines so these are super comfy pockets is a pen just cuz you sometimes need to write stuff this is actually my lucky pen back when I was doing my high school exams I spent a long time researching pens I was trying to find the single pen
that had the lowest friction coefficient so that I was as streamlined as possible while writing out my essays and this jet stream is like a $2 pen that does that so I keep it with me everywhere now and then on the left side this is the chili Series 2 water bottle find the idea of water bottles having a series 2 so funny Next Generation water but yeah the most important thing for me with the water bottle was making absolute sure that it's leak proof I realize it doesn't look like that right now because I
dipped this backpack in water earlier but it's also got a couple of extra niceties it can keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot so sometimes it's water sometimes it's black coffee it's got a really interesting lip that makes it weirdly comfortable to drink from and then it's also got this rubber base so it's not clanging around as you pick it up and put it down we'll put that there I'm trying to turn this into a really aesthetic unpacking oh also what's really cool about these side pockets is
when they're empty they're magnetized so they sit completely flush with the bag now front pockets I realize how this looks it's actually much more tragic um this is a bag of tea I really like my home tea bags and no hotel that I go to seems to be able to match them and these are Milo's treats I have a very needy cat good boy and a sub to the channel would be all delicious to some oh yeah other thing I love about this bag is most of the backpacks I tested I pretty much end up
filling every single available pocket this thing has so many that I probably still got like eight spare this was one of my main criteria when searching for a backpack is that when you unzip the compartment it opens completely flat and the beauty of this is you get to your hotel room on the other side of wherever you're traveling to and this is your suitcase and this actually opens completely flat like this both in the front compartment and the back compartment but I'm getting to the back
front first four more pockets on the side I don't even know what to do with all of them but I'm using the bottom two because one of them actually has something quite cool this is a retractable key holder so this is where I keep my backup keys and what's quite reassuring about this leash is that I know for absolute certainty that my keys will be in this pocket when I open the bag I've also recently come around to the idea of these key organizers and then when you want to use them you just
swivel them out like this tuck them back in and on the other side is my wallet this is a Pokémon Center X Fossil wallet and it doesn't really have any redeeming features it's it's just a Pokémon wallet but there is one cool thing that I want to show you here this is the chipolo item finder and functions in a very similar way to an air tag it's just the form factor is much better suited for slipping into a wallet like a card okay this is where things get fun so this is the belroy toiletry kit plus and I
really like these belroy bags the material is both very reassuring but also holds it shape quite well and the Zips also feel really high quality and this is actually I keep all of my smaller Electronics in and it just makes sense because one bag keeps everything together it means that you know if you have that bag you have everything you need and also airport security this is all the stuff that's going to get you stopped so you might as well get it all through in one go so it
starts with the anchor Prime power bank this thing has a "27,600 Mah capacity and 250 WS worth of" charging power I went crazy with this this is very high spec but the way I see it the power bank is the center of my entire e system every single Gadget I carry with me can be powered by this but also it can do some pretty cool stuff like if I accidentally leave it somewhere how many power Banks do you know that have a speaker built in oh yeah but also there's another reason I
went for this and it's because anchor has a pretty good ecosystem so these are anchor charging bases and they're specifically designed to magnetically connect to these Prime power Banks to keep them charged up so this is the one place where we like to keep all the gadgets in the entire house charged up and we used to do it in the this really kind of clunky way with these massive bricks and cables sprawling across the entire thing but because these charging bases have separate ports on the sides
to charge your other products all of our Tech can basically be powered by just two of these anytime I come back from a trip I take the used power bank drop it on and then I take one that I know is absolutely going to be full and I just repack it oh yeah this is a beautiful invention this is the maax 100 wat Universal travel adapter I didn't know this existed until a couple of weeks ago this is your adapter and your charger in one device so there's four ports at the bottom which is the maximum number of
things I'm realistically going to be charging at any one time and that final one at the end that's powerful enough for a laptop and then here you plug in anything requiring a wall outlet and that can be us Australia UK Europe and it turns it into US Australia UK Europe so this one product covers the wall charging needs of every single piece of tech that I bring with me and you can also get a bigger 140 WT version but 100 actually works just fine for the stuff I carry there's yet more hidden Zips
inside of here and so this one has my sim ejector tour yes I went for The Dark Knight this came as part of a limited edition Batman phone it's kind of sick airpods Pro 2 the only light thing I own but that's because it's technically a Mr who's the boss Edition they're not quite what I would call a true Hi-Fi experience but there's not really a way to currently get that with wireless inar earphones so from everything I've tested this is the best combo of sound isolation but then also battery life and
so upon coming to that conclusion I decided to last year get one of these made for every single member of our team so everyone has the Mr who the boss logo on the front and then they have their name written on the back oh yeah and the actual airpods themselves are also white and blue these are the Zeiss lens wipes I used to carry around a microfiber cloth all the time but I feel like when your screen reaches a certain level of fingerprin iness it just doesn't cut it and these are the only things I found
that do because they're Co with a few chemicals that just instant wipe the dirtiest of screens but I only use them when I need to that's actually perfectly fallen into a really aesthetic position this is one of my Staples the span ire and before deciding on this I did play around with loads of stuff more like this which has multiple interchanging heads like you can do lightning you can do micro USB USBC usba but as I was putting this backpack together it became very clear to me that if you're buying
good quality modern technology you don't need anything else apart from USBC and that really is such a blessing because it means you can just buy one or two really good quality USBC cables and that is everything you need and so the reason I went with The Arc wire is exactly that it's one very good USBC cable it's incredibly reliable incredibly thick as well as you can probably tell so this isn't going to break on me it's going to be able to charge my stuff it's going to
be able to data transfer very very fast by the way and also it's Thunderbolt 4 so I can use this to hook my iPad up to a massive 5K monitor if I wanted to there's a backup SD card in here in case I a donut and I forget my main one SD card adapter for the iPad Pro which fixes the one key port that it's missing compared to a Macbook one more USBC cable and then this this is the ESR ch2 wireless charger and these guys are sponsoring this video but this is genuinely what I'm carrying around every
single day it's very light it folds like a wallet so it's a really easy shape to shove in a pocket or a tech bag like this it charges up to three things at once so in my Cas that's my phone my earphones and my Apple watch but then also this is second generation Chi charging so the phone charging is twice as powerful as normal CH Chargers and your watch charging is four times and the really cool part of this is look the watch charger is completely removable so if I just want to charge my watch
without the other stuff this plugs straight into the power bank ESR does also do this really cool 3in one watch charging set again removable watch charger which is very cool but I think it's more for home than travel and Alo this magnetic Wireless car charger and it's all ch2 plus ESR stuff is really well priced so Link in the description if you want to check it out and the wireless charging is actually quite a nice segue into this so this is my phone this is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra and
the high level summary is I really like it the battery life never lets me down it just I feel like every single year it gets harder and harder to straddle ecosystems so using a Samsung phone while most of the rest of my stuff is primarily designed around Apple products but I have some somewhat managed to save myself from this because you know after that phone repair video where we went around and we basically came to the conclusion that the entire phone repair industry is a bit of a mess I got myself
a case and what I really like about this case is that a obviously it protects the phone B it has a stand baked into the bottom which works in both orientations but see it gives my Samsung mag safe so I can just do this this pit isn't even sponsored by ESR but that's an ESR case and then on that note this is the Apple Watch series 9 it's not the best looking Smartwatch I strongly prefer the more circular designed ones like the Galaxy watch and the pixel watch but this thing has
changed my life you know just like the airpods as a separate gift we actually got everyone in our team one of these two and we've been using it to create this internal fitness challenge where every two months we Crown a winner based on who has achieved their own Fitness objectives the best and so this has basically become my personal accountability tool I know that every single person on this team is going to be able to see what I get up to today and then the strap I'm using is
literally a 50 c strap I got from a fake Apple watch that I bought in India I'm just wearing it in protest of how expensive the real ones are by the way isn't it already kind of crazy how much stuff I've managed to take out the bag and how little of the bag we've actually emptied now this is the second belroy wash bag uh this one is not the plus this is the standard size and I got a brown one just so I can tell immediately at a glance which one is which and yes this one actually does have toiletries
in it and it's at this point that you can probably start to see my objectives with this bag I am in the lucky position where I often get a lot of spontaneous opportunities come up someone will email me and say Aaron do you want to be in Spain in 3 days time and my whole life before I got this all together that would stress me out because all of a sudden in those 3 days I had to fit in running up and down the house getting every single little bit that I could possibly need take it away from its
original intended position and put it all together in a bag in a way that it fits but what is so beautiful about this setup is that it's designed so that if I want to go somewhere now all I need to do is spend a minute and a half putting three sets of clothes in and I'm off so hair styling powder I found that to be way better than wax or gel I always carry around two individually wrapped hand sanitizers just in case you go to a bathroom and there's no soap or you cut yourself it's good to disinfect folding
toothbrush which just makes too much sense because it keeps the head of the toothbrush clean while also picking up half the normal footprint sadly could not find this in dark mode and then one more cool thing about this belroy bag is a little magnetic latch and behind which is the Gillette Labs razor which is the best razor I've ever used because it moves in two different axes it's got a little exfoliating bar but also if you  self-defense that went further the first time I did it I have no idea why they
needed to turn it into a projectile but you just never know and then just just to show you how much other stuff fits in here moisturizer suncream mini mouthwash antiperspirant perfume oh this one's actually fun this is also a perfume but it was designed by a robot and apparently algorithmically tuned to my preferences there's a short on our Channel where I got this made toothpaste backup painkiller and the last thing is my EpiPen I have a very severe peanut allergy so I always need to know where
this is right just before we get to the very back of the bag there's three t shirts fit in here and I might as well show you because a few people have asked me so I found these in Japan the brand is called Theory and they are by far the most expensive t-shirts I own but the material is so high quality and heavy that I tend to wear these to even smart events and also they barely need any ironing which is perfect for something that you have to keep shoved in a bag shorts which also double as swim shorts
so I don't need to pack two separate things and then cargo trousers um I used to be a jeans guy my entire life but as soon as this became a socially seable thing to wear I was all in on it because you have like a th000 Pockets now oh yeah and all underwear is in a separate middle compartment but we don't need to review that need some more space on this table socks underwear I'm only putting this out cuz I'm trying to show you the sheer holding capacity of this bag and do you want to know probably the single
coolest part of it it is this this ZIP right here so what you've seen up until this point is a 20 L backpack a very generous 20 L back pack you can fit a lot in there but if I open this and it goes all the way around this is now a 30 L backpack and the reason I've gone for something that does that is in case I also want to carry this this is our camera bag and for quite a while we've actually been using this $20 Amazon Basics camera bag but over time as we figured out exactly the things we need
and nothing more we've transitioned to the belroy camera sling there are some really cool things about it like for example how often do you see a bag where you can zip it one way but you can also zip it entirely from the other direction to open it and long story short this perfectly fits everything that we possibly need on our shoot days my camera which is the Sony A7 S3 the microphone we've got three different key lenses oh and this this is the aperture MC Pro it's like a tiny little light
that's an entire studio in one Gadget I'll just show you how bright it is so first of all that's crazy considering how well lit this room already is with massive soft boxes plus magnetic attachments on the back you can equip a soft box for the front which massively softens the light on your face you can also magnetically attach a honeycomb which restricts the light to only shooting in One Direction so that you can perfectly light yourself without needing to bleed into the background and
then you can do both at the same time not to mention like any color you could possibly want we've got our microphones and again every single thing USBC and you might be thinking well Ain you got a camera that camera is not going to be USBC is it well hidden Pocket time so in here I have five spare batteries for our Sony camera and yeah these are traditionally designed to kind of slot in place in one of those archaic camera battery chargers but also we have found batteries that have a USBC Port which
means yes we can charge these using the same anchor power base that we use to charge the power bank and everything else but yeah the camera bag is just a fun little and yes it actually does fit inside of the go Matic bag but we're not actually quite done with this yet cuz this is the back pocket opens flat and so right now in this back I have three things iPad Pro 13 in apple magic keyboard and the apple pencil Pro and it's kind of crazy to say but this this little 5 mm thin machine
has become my entire workstation when I'm outside the house it can do all of my laptop things but also so much more like idea generation I'm constantly sketching things with this apple pencil actually funnily enough even the plan for the thumbnail of this video also this is such a good Netflix machine for when you're on the plane plus I also ended up going for the cellular model so this thing has its own data connection and I'm not hotspotting from anything which just makes it faster so yeah the
iPad Pro M4 has officially become my Mac away from home but the crazy part of it is the bag is so big I could could have fit in a Mac 2 let me know if you enjoyed this slightly more impromptu video and maybe we'll turn it into a series catch you in the next one
