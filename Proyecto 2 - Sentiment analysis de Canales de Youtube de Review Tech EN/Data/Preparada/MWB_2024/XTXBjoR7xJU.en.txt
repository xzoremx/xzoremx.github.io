this is the darkest paint in the world that you can buy I'm going to see if I can use it to make my phone disappear so I've specifically picked a phone that has a removable back it's going to make painting a whole lot easier plus this is such a brightly colored back that the difference is going to be really cool to see oh now just to give you some sort of idea normal white paint can absorb about 20% of visible light normal black paint or something like the back of this phone
can absorb about 94% of visible light this muso black paint can absorb up to 99.4% I Really Love this thing up oh God if this works we'll have made the darkest smartphone in the world dry time and I'm hoping that using hot air like this is also going to iron out the brush stroke to make it completely smooth wait this thing is so dark I can't even see where the case ends and the paper begins so let's do the reveal this is a black phone this is the darkest phone ever
