oh this is apparently the heaviest mug in the world and there's a very good reason for it the entire packaging has been ripped apart presumably because of how heavy it is wow the handle is welded on like a dumbbell grip and you're probably going to need that grip because my God holy moly this thing is ridiculous I can't believe the brand is just heavy and literally has half the capacity of a normal mug so let's figure out just how much it weighs with the mug if I stand on a scale I weigh 90.5 kg
now without the mug we try again I have lost 10.1 kilos so why on Earth would anyone want a mug that weighs 10 kg well it's designed so that you have to work out to earn your drink every single time  curl it feels a lot heavier than 10 kilos oh my God screw this I'm not thirsty anymore
