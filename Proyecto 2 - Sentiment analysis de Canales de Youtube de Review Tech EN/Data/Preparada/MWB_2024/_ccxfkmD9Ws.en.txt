the mighty mug apparently makes spilling your drink completely impossible I've seen people test this online people call it a miracle but how far can we push it this is a very real can of Diet Coke and I'm about to whack it towards a very real "$122,000 smartphone made of pure 24" karat gold it works by getting rid of most of the air underneath the cup to create a low press environment because there's then a low press environment below and a high pressure environment above it creates a strong downward
pulling force and I mean strong oh my God but it gets better because there is an inner portion to this base that when you lift the cup straight up it lifts up allowing more air into the base to equalize the pressure and let the cup lift up normally but it can't be invincible so let's test it off the limit oh no what have I done
