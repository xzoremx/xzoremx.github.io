the lepro tb1 is what happens when you fuse lighting with artificial intelligence so at its very base level you pull open the app you tell it what you want I would like to read and then this becomes a reading light at the perfect color temperature for reading a book actually screw this I want my phone back I want to have a Halloween themed party wow those are all three colors I would associate with Halloween and then the app also gives you a whole load of alternative options Merry Christmas that
is so cool plus bear in mind that each of these three rings move independently so you can make it look exactly how you want it to and that this thing is trained in human psychology so you can even say things like I'm so happy and it can actually use the best understandings of the effects of lighting on mood to emphasize that emotion it can do planet simulations for example this is Jupiter but I think the most impressive part of this is that the Leo AI lighting is far Smarter with sying to music if you've
ever used smart lights before you'll know this is usually by far their weakest feature because all they do is rely on their microphone to reflect the intensity of the music but the lepero actually uses their light Beats technology to understand human hearing and create a way more Dynamic effect
