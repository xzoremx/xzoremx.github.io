this is not a real bird it's actually a bionic bird designed to flap its wings to mimic both the movement and appearance of a real bird so kind of like a drone but just apparently with one distinct benefit I'm curious if it will go all the way to the sky like the real birds oh my God ah you trying to kill me so this is the app you Ed to control it the further you push forward the faster the wings flap then you rotate the phone left to turn it left and you rotate the phone right to turn the bird right
that's so surreal I can't believe I'm controlling this you want to come down buddy I'm curious though how precisely can you control a bird okay so not the best so why would anyone ever pick one of these over a drone well because apparently the fact that there's Wings instead of propellers it makes less noise but does it
