you see this airpod right here let me just grab it wait what can't well the reason for that is that this is a 3D mirror scope which has both halves lined with a mirror finish in such a way that it bounces light so that the object placed at the bottom is projected to appear as if it's floating on top but even cooler is the 10 segr table I mean this doesn't even look like it should be holding itself up but I can actually put weight onto it like a normal table and that's because the entire weight is
actually being carried by this elasticated string right here the chains are just there to help stabilize it and also sell you on this weightless illusion next we have an app called Parallax view it combines your phone's baked in accelerometer with some pretty Advanced Eye tracking based on the front camera to give you the illusion of 3D shapes sticking out or going into your phone screen but is anything cooler than a magnetically levitating stamp so you grab the object that you want to
levitate you place a supporting magnet on the inside oh it's a little bit fiddly to get just right but by adding these weighted marbles on the inside look at that it works
