in front of you right now are some of the most glamorous Limited Edition phones on the internet I'm talking Disney Princesses to high-end fashion designer collaborations with the top few having their own surprising extra twists so settle into your most dripped Out Chair this one's going to be well very sparkly starting with the Barbie phone by hmd the company that's now behind Nokia phones real phone without distractions bit ironic for a hot pink device with a mirror on it wao I don't
even know where to start there's a friendship bracelet looking thing that I think is actually a bedazzled lanyard for the phone you got a second back plate oh no there's two spare back plates and then the phone is in the middle you know what's also really cool and probably a sign that I am a married man now this is presented just like a jewelry box right down to the dividers and the soft felt interior someone's had a very good time putting this together oh my God it continues there's a Barbie
branded screen cleaning cloth so these are incredibly fiddly one second these are additional pendants that you can add to further accessorize feel a bit like pencil erasers is this a battery oh my God they made the battery pink and then a sticker page and even glitzier sticker page and of course the instruction manual is in pink too what a treat oh so this is actually a screen on the front while being a slightly distorted plasticky mirror ironically about the most useful standby screen I've ever
seen on the phone all right so the actual software is kind of basic although I will say satisfying to use everything looks very themed and each action has its own accompanying sound effect what's this this Malibu snake there's a Barbie version of snake do you remember the days when this game felt like all the entertainment you would ever need let's see what else it's dual SIM for all the highflying business people that this has clearly been designed for toally untraceable charges with USBC which is highly
unexpected um it's got one pre-loaded contact it just says Ken they have an actual phone number registered to this contact BRB just transferring everything I have to my Barbie phone love but nervous what if he picks up call home oh ken okay there buddy what a weird thing to put on a phone obviously the first thing anyone's going to do when you add Ken as their contact is call that number is it like so like girls can show other girls that look I've got Ken's number I don't know how girls thinking I yeah
should talk to some you know what also super weird so I'm trying to add a new contact and you can add someone who's born in 1990 you can add someone who's born in 1980 but you can't do earlier than that which shows you everything you need to know about who this film was designed for this Barbie meditation you will hear a gentle gong sound at the start and the end of the session so that's the start yep okay it's a timer I don't know how I feel about this to be honest it's very
Charming just how much effort and thought has gone into the thing like this whole series of Barbie tips for a better life for example but at the same time it does feel very toy like and the functionality is no better than a phone half the price of it 6 out of 10 I'd say L now all the way up at $450 an hour it's time for the Disney Princess phone by xiaomi specifically by the looks of things focusing on Snow White if you somehow don't know Snow White by the way it's the story of a beautiful princess
who fleeing from her jealous stepmother the evil queen who becomes absolutely obsessed with trying to be the most beautiful woman in the land takes Refuge with seven dwarves only for the queen to try multiple times to kill her so can you see that really faint outline of Snow White in this mirror that's referencing how every time the evil queen asked her magic mirror who's the fairest in the land the mirror would show Snow White so inside this logo is so cool Pi cure poison so that's Snow
White with the queen there's an insert which tells the story eh I think I did it better come at me Walt I've got to say though I love how dark and gritty they've made this thing you know when you buy a Disney themed phone you expect it to be unicorns and fairies but I think what they've done here is even better so this box has the Sim ejector which is a sword through the heart ouchie it's the same emblem that was on the box which the queen wanted to put Snow White's heart into which yeah this
movie was a lot Bleaker than I remember what else a sheet of stickers manuals and then the case oh damn this is special it's got like a Louis Vuitton style pattering on the inside and it's actually Tastefully done not to mention the other side which looks even more premium this looks like the poison apple down here which after the whole taking her heart out thing failed was the Evil Queen's Plan B for ending Snow White's life and it looks like it double as a popsocket it's really embellishing the
whole freaky after hours Disney film kind of vibe they got going on here and we haven't even got to the phone so below the thing is a generic looking  it I'm so confused there are seven apps on this phone nothing else Snow White and the Seven apps oh I just realized the battery icon is actually a poison apple that's unique and the charging animation is oh God is that poison apple again but this time it's bubbling man if this is what the thing actually looked like and Snow White still put it in her mouth I
think it's fair to say she had it coming there's apparently also some new camera filters princess oh it's actually distorting my entire face it's enlarging my forehead it's bringing in my chin the lipstick m i mean it's quite impressive in a way but I feel like the entire takeaway of the story was not to be obsessed with your looks so slightly ironic too and you also have Queen right next to it which is look like a killer clown so if you take a photo on princess it gives you this like Rosy cheek effect
and if you take a photo on Queen you just look all dead now here's what I'm most curious about this phone has an actual mirror on the back which is absolutely amazing by the way you know those times where you really want to see if you've got some fluff in your hair and your selfie camera doesn't quite cut it this is actually useful as well as being so thematically fitting because mirror mirror on the wall was what the evil queen used to say every time she asked who was the fairest of them all
but what I've been wondering is does this mirror also allow you to take selfies using your highquality rear cameras oh wow so I actually have to get my face really far back for this to fit okay just about oh wow yeah not at all the actual camera angle is way wider than the mirror angle feels like a missed opportunity little bit of a let down from what is otherwise an elite tier limited edition I've just realized it takes bites out of the apple as the battery percentage goes down 9 out of 10
now as we learned from Snow White beauty isn't all about looks which is why I am resolving to finding Beauty in other places like beautiful game football if you were lucky enough to see Argentina's football World Cup victory in 2022 FIFA called it the greatest final ever both Argentina and France were absolutely going for it they scored three goals each two of which from Argentina came from lonel Messi and so the final came down to penalties where Argentina made it look like they were shooting right
but instead dipped it beautifully into the Bott left corner to take that trophy home and this phone is a celebration of that and you can tell it's not a rush job too so on the top of the insert it says Argentina World Champion 2022 and then on the back is all the players on the team at the time even the substitutes get a shout out that's cool we got a super themed up charger the cable is color match too and then the  ooh very nice oh there's actually some more down here there's the Sim ejector
tool which is a really three-dimensional looking football on the back and inside is a plain black case I'm quite impressed with the details on this so this number 10 is Leon Messi's number presumably because he was labeled as the best player in the entire world cup and it's got a really unique texture the rest of this is basically designed to look like Argentina's 2022 kit and it's even got three dates going across here 1978 19 886 and 2022 the three times they've won
the World Cup wa not too sure about this there's something a little too Dead behind the eyes about the way these guys are standing here and then okay there's a custom gold clock there white circular icons maybe that's to try and make them look like little footballs got to say though it's super strange how they've themed like 90% of the icons and then they've just left the final few that's a red card offence right there all they needed to do was to just set a rule so that the phone Auto recolors any app
that isn't already this blue color and that's basically it it's not a bad limited edition but it's also far from a winner this would be like a quarterfinals kind of phone 5 out of 10 but what's even more tantalizing than a football win seeing your two favorite superheroes Deadpool and Wolverine finally come together for a movie and I've got to say these guys absolutely crushed the marketing of it the Deadpool themed cheeky Xbox controller the custom highly suggestive popcorn buckets they
made I was fully cracking up and as part of that marketing they also released a smartphone okay so inside we got a board it's even got a custom tag on top that's cool and then this is the synopsis of the movie as if anyone would actually buy this thing without already knowing what happens oh this is sick so there's a right draw and a left draw the right has a wolverine tag on it so that's got huh okay just a white power brick with a logo on it and then a plain white cable
but then the left draw has the Deadpool tag and it has a Deadpool Sim ejector as well as a gen looking case so then we've  phone I like the design of the rear like even though these images of Deadpool and Wolverine are flat the way that the lighting bounces off them is actually very three-dimensional and you might be thinking Aaron this isn't a beautiful phone ah yes but you haven't seen how Deadpool looks underneath his mask cuz that that is something special a there
is nothing on the phone itself this just looks like a completely stock experience not even a new wallpaper which is just insulting to be honest considering that you can now generate one in about 5 Seconds unless these three prongs here are a reference to Wolverine's claws yeah this is what desperation feels like so my take is that the entire purpose of this phone was to generate hype for the movie so they got their best crack team to make an awesome packaging experience
and phone back design and then that was their job done that's enough to make something that generates some easy hype so much for maximum effort is pretty disint appointing considering how much customization can be done on a phone and how much was done for the much simpler merch products three out of 10 but now "we're moving on to the $1,000 plus" offerings starting with the Samsung Z "flip 6 Olympics edition only 177,000 of" these were made and they were given exclusively to Olympic athletes sorry oh
my God but yeah on first glance this does seem like a really strange product but I can see why they do it it's not for people to donate to their cats but nice try handing a free custom rare phone to people is going to generate coverage and this is coverage from all public figures specifically at the time where most people are paying attention to those public figures while tying into the thing people are paying attention for you'll notice this is a much thicker box than what normally comes with the
Samsung phone and that's because there's two parts here so this top is a collab between Samsung and belti a French leather maker cuz you know it's the Paris Olympics and this is actually quite a cool collab cuz you might know that Samsung has a style of art case called the flip suit and this while being a nice looking premium case in its own right also grants the phone a matching live wallpaper to go with it and the phone itself is in the compartment below that a brave bright
yellow looking device that's new it's like a full-on inspirational speech this is your moment you the athletes are the heart of the Olympic and Par Olympic movement well you don't say Enjoy your new Samsung Galaxy Z flip 6 I mean it is an insane gift to give people but it's just funny how they're trying to to make a link between the Olympic movement and their Smartphone when the closest link is that you've got two of the five rings on the back wow that is cool though that
is very cool I guess this is meant to look like a running track now the actual back of the phone looks pretty bad I have to say I assume the color was meant to be gold kind of like a metal but it actually just looks bright yellow and all of this just reminds me of you know there's people who get adverts plased over their cars to earn a few extra bucks thankfully though this case is beautiful it's got a leather-like exterior a felt likee interior and that should switch the existing wallpaper
which is already very cool and Olympic themed to this it's like the opening of a movie the phone's also got a custom Olympic themed always on display as well as a pretty basic theme applied to the icons oh frog wait so Samsung actually pre-loaded every single one of these phones with 100 GB of 5G data there's a whole bunch of different apps that allow the athletes to know what they're doing and share photo with each other and also a prepaid unlimited public transport card man I think it's time for me to
start training any chance competitive Pokémon is going to become an Olympic sport oh and this is a game so this whole thing was designed just for the 2024 Olympics so you venture into these portals the portals take you to different worlds and then apparently if "you score 10,000 points within the game" you could redeem that at the Olympics for a set of limited edition pins oh no way these are the actual athletes that's cool now I'm just imagining like the entire rowing team missing their event
cuz they were too busy collecting pins on their shiny new Galaxy Z flips or selling their Limited Edition phones on "eBay for apparently over $10,000 a pop 8" out of 10 now if you thought that was "limited at$ 17,000 units this next phone" was made just 800 times that is extremely low for a smartphone and I got to say right off the bat I'm not getting a great Vibe it looks fun but also really tacky and cheap so this this is a figure of to be honest I know very little about it so I'm going to pull up
our sponsor the Opera browser command plus slash to bring up Opera's integrated ARA AI who is this a model of it says the model is dormon good confirmation but I probably could have worked that out by reading the front of the box so what I'm more curious about is why do people love him so much okay durmon is a beloved character because he entertains while teaching moral lessons by tackling common issues like friendship kindness and problem solving holy moly as of 2024 the Duran manga has
sold over 300 million copies making it one of the best selling manga series of all time so we also got a Duran limited edition flips suitc case that's interesting we'll see what this does in a minute and then the Samsung Galaxy Z flip phone which comes in its own separate retail box but there is more uh what am I looking at yeah this looks like it's deconstructed during travel also is not very premium regardless it looks like this magnet was meant to just stick onto here so dormond
can go on top pop and then this is his backdrop okay well anyway let's dive into the main package to see if Samsung has rescued it with the software oh my God it's even worse than I thought I feel a little laded just looking at the thing this might be the poorest user interface design I have seen in The Last 5 Years the same is true for this flip suit live wallpaper there's so much happening and it's also happening at a very low frame rate which makes it even harder to watch also thanks to fujico
Pro for persistently reminding me that it's copyrighted why don't we just use arya's image generation make me a dman wallpaper that's this resolution and voila yeah there you go that's literally 100 times better than what was there before anyways yeah Opera's integrated AR AI is just one reason to give the Opera browser a shop it's also got tab Islands quick shortcuts to your apps and a lot more so link below to download it for free oh the home screen doesn't look so bad oh it's there the rest of the user
interface my God that is terrible while I do have to give Samsung credit that they at least did try something different this is the only time I've said this I actually would have preferred it if they hadn't how did we end up in a world where the Barbie phone had more class 2 out of 10 limited edition now while this next one is not technically a phone this does feel like one of the most uniquely bizarre collaborations that I have to show you so host Malone you know the famous artist is a massive
gamer but he has apparently struggled to keep up that gaming while he's touring the world performing so he decided to partner up with backbone a gaming controller company to make this and does it not look an awful lot like it just came straight from a war zone when have you ever seen a piece of tech package like this and then you open it with this lever it feels extremely authentic that was satisfying oh this is like a ration pack this is how you often get food when you're out camping or you're an
astronaut and so if we cut inside oh wow he really went to town with this presentation that's for sure layers upon layers of it and then inside of this box we have the controller itself I mean design-wise I got to say I wish all celebrities put this much effort in but you should watch the video about celebrity Tech if you want to see what that's about you can tell post Malone cared about this I'm loving the transparent green case it's green because that's post Malone's favorite
color there's some cool hidden text when you expand the controller and this P&amp;M are actually apparently glow-in-the-dark let's try it I think I do prefer this to LEDs that are just wasting battery for something you can't even see analog sticks feel really smooth and console quality shoulder buttons are really plush and comfy and hey this thing gives you your headphone jack back I'm not so sure about the face buttons and the d-pad though they're made of aluminium on this Edition which is incredibly
bougie but they're quite tiny and they have really high resistance which reminds me a lot of Nintendo's joy-cons not a compliment oh you can use this button to take a screenshot that's really handy why can't you just hold down to take a screen recording that would be such an obvious handy feature for people wanting to share their gameplay Okay so we've looked it up it is actually meant to be able to do that like hold down and take a screen recording it is not working for us but I
did find on the way that these guys actually charge a monthly subscription for most of their features which don't really look like they need one it's not a cheap subscription either making this a very expensive controller considering that by default when it was launched it was $200 but then because it was limited "to 500 units we had to pay over 1,000 to" actually get it six out of 10 on balance but this next one should be the epitome of beauty so jimmmy cheu the fashion
"brand that charges $1,000 for a pair of" "boots $4,000 for a little bag has worked" with honor to create a luxury flip phone and this one actually comes in not one but two boxes so let's start with the smaller one this is very nondescript but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited um why do I have a feeling I could sell this bag for as much as I paid for the phone this is bizarre there's something inside this is it looks like a second longer strap for if you want to wear the bag over your
shoulder I assume it's very weird cuz what does this have to do with a phone oh oh it's a it's a flip phone so the phone will actually fit inside this bag that's cool so then the second package has the phone on top it does initially look like there's something in this insert but I can't see a way to open it and then on level two that's a pretty basic looking Sim ejector for Mr Chew I'm quite surprised and then just manuals in there this is cool there's two cases in here so one is a mapped
hard plastic case the other is oh the braver choice the more textured bedazzled option with a ring that would double as your phone holder too huh plus a lanyard it really is quite well thought out I mean don't get me wrong I don't think I'm the target jimmmy Chu customer but I could totally see that someone who is willing to spend north of "$11,000 on a pair of shoes would very" much enjoy matching their phone case with their handbag with their phone with their outfit and at the very bottom a
shoe pendant because they make shoes I  itself well that is fancy so the wallpapers on the inside and the outside screen also match everything else it's nothing super high effort but I can see the appeal and there's also a custom gold watch face on the front here but did they forget to add the numbers how am I supposed to tell the time off an unlabeled octogonal Emerald I do like the fact that there is barely any crease when you open the phone which can't be said for the last few flips that were
based off Samsung phones this though this right here I do not understand whose idea was it after our pal Jimmy has gone to all the effort of making a custom phone custom handbag two custom cases exclusive wallpapers and more to put the icons like this off center not filling the row and covering the wallpaper I can't lie though very cool limited edition overall I'd say I tell it's a 9 out of 10 and I will catch you in the next one
