this phone can apparently stop a bullet so let's test that it's designed by a company called caviar it costs over "$10,000 and as far as durability is" concerned it is well beyond even military specification with a thick titanium alloy coating on the back so I bought the most powerful air rifle you can get within the legal limits which can shoot out lead pellets at 800 ft per second man I love how the cameras are completely flush with the body all right let's shoot first we're going to shoot a
normal phone for a point of comparison that's how you know it's powerful okay 3 2 one wo so powerful oh my God the bullet's completely lodged inside and now for the bulletproof phone I haven't actually missed one shot while using this gun I'm pretty scared this bullet's going to come back 3 2 1 W I hit something and it is completely unmarked and the screen is 100% functional
