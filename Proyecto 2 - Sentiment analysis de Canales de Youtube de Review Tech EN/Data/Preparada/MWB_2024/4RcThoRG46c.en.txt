in front of me right now are VTech products made by the world's biggest celebrities everything from smart watches that replace your smartphone to microphones that make you sing better to Cyclone powerered popcorn machines so have these celebrities used their special talents to make something genuinely amazing or have they actually just abused their Fame to sell you a load of hot garbage time to find out with our lovely homemade ratings chart and let's actually go in order of how
famous the person is starting with Will I Am who already has a very respectable 1.6 million Instagram followers and he has made a smartwatch called the dial holy cow this packaging is amazing it looks like a floor standing speaker and here is the watch why does it look like a handcuff now the key selling point here is that this thing has full smartphone functionality and it runs on a voice activated oper ow it's got such a strong magnet it just ripped off my arm it runs
off a voice activated operating system called an needer like I needer un Ely I need a network connection to help you first name I need a second name connection the actual interface is fine enough I guess it looks somewhat slick and like a smart watch but it's pretty clear the core functionality rests on it communicating with some sort of server that I am pretty certain the dude's just taken down to be fair the quality isn't terrible for a watch camera it's just the colors need some work I look like a
Simpson I'm honestly not surprised it barely works to be honest it it looks like it doesn't even listen to Will I Am himself  music do you feel like eating but before we decide how low will he go on our beautiful scoreboard we've got two more products from the guy first the super mask designed I guess to be the Batman utility belt of face masks okay so it's got a silicon seal that goes over your nose it's got LED lights on the outside two three-speed ventilation fans and noise cancelling
bluetooth earbuds that magnetically dock onto the mask when not in use to broadcast your ear wax to the people sitting on either side of you there's a slightly bigger problem here this mask is on its tightest setting right now the one product where it's absolutely vital that you create a complete seal and yet there were two different sizes there was small medium and then medium large but between those two options I'm firmly in the camp of medium large Joseph can I just check I'm not being an idiot here
course so that's the tightest possible setting yes see if it fits you no in the nicest way possible how large would you say your head is uh all my loved ones in my entire life I said have got a fat head I always go for the extra large and the minimal padding in helmets if you wore the straps higher up then does it fit no cuz then you got a massive Gap here how do they make a face mask that doesn't mask your face I'm starting to get the feeling that everyone's favorite pandemic doctor will
I am doesn't completely think things through and finally we've got his earphones called the buttons which unlike basically every single other set of earphones that do everything they can to hide themselves these are designed to like the buttons on your clothing specifically be on show they're meant to be the way for you to show the world you love music by looking a lot like vinyl records which also happen to snap together with magnets dude what is it with this guy and the insistence on
showing people the insides of your ears so will I am is is not so bril I am I'm going to give you a three mostly for the effort oh wow this this one looks a lot more budget than I was expecting it to this is the IMT pain microphone and it's oh it's packaged in that horrible sharp plastic I guess so you can really feel with te pain but this is actually a pretty cool product idea because even if you have no idea who Tain is I think there's a pretty good chance that you've
heard tain's voice at some point it is famously autotuned like so autotuned that I have no idea what he sounds like  autotune and so this can apparently give that power to you oh God I hate this although I'm actually the perfect candidate to test this with because I cannot sing so there's a record button  play okay interesting it's time to whip it out what I'm actually really upset that you're going to hear my before singing as well as my after we've known each other for so long this a big moment
right here play we've known each other for so long I will take that that's the first time I've ever heard myself singing where I don't want to run and hide myself under my bed in silence for the next week there's another button here which apparently allows you to drop a dirty background track we've known each other for so long all right we've known each other for so long you know what I actually like it no one would ever use this to record real music but it's a lot of fun and then when you're done press
these two buttons pull that off and this is a USB port so you can download to your computer the files of you singing so this is the trailer for The Product hey knock off that racket I will turn this car around everything sounds better with the  Boom hey still noise one button te pain effect I am T and I approve this me so it's not just for performances this is also a child discipline tool t p is a marketing genius so Mr Tay not a professional piece of equipment but does what it says on the tin which is more
than we can say for some 5 out of 10 all the way up at 7.1 million Instagram followers now we've got Fernando Alonso who depending on what you're into is either going to be a massive deal or you have no idea who I'm talking about Alonso is a Spanish Formula 1 World Champion currently driving for Aston Martin but I love how he's put carting world champion before F1 in his bio guy's got his priorities straight and so what he's done is built a Lifestyle brand called kimoa off the back of his
racing career and in what might be the most fitting product for a Formula 1 racing driver to make this is their version of an e scooter at kimoa we believe that life perseveres within regardless of what occurs externally this is why we love the Sun the Sea and the light because they reflect a way of being just as the sun rises internally each day tell me you've used chat gbt without telling me you've used chat gbt doesn't exactly scream unique products that have had lots of love put into them
though I do have an idea of where we can test this we'll get to it oh this one's fun so for some baffling reason soundcloud's Golden Boy rapper Soldier Boy you know this guy started selling his own video game consoles in 2018 and the Pinnacle of them released in 2021 was supposed to be the solder boy game get it I think these are the cheapest feeling earphones I've ever held I remember the guy's Twitter marketing at the time this thing wasn't just being sold as a knockoff Game Boy it was
advertised with a 3.5 in touchscreen Netflix Spotify and apple music right out the box and it was supposedly going to have some huge big brand big budget games including fortnite and Call of Duty long story short it became pretty clear that the legendary soldja boy game was actually just an existing gaming handheld called the trdr pocket but in red and after it turned out that it was a scam and basically no one who bought one seemed to receive one Soulja Boy then started promising those buyers that
they would instead get an upgraded model with AI that was now worth $400 and this is that oh God this thing is so reflective not a good choice of finish for a gaming console so it runs Android which means oh no the Call of Duty and the fortnite games he's promised to people they're just the mobile games aren't they it doesn't even meet the minimum requirements to run fortnite fortnite on a phone does not have very high minimum requirements uh it plays the emulator okay it's not like the best
visual or frame rate experience but it's it's not bad as an emulator the thing has no shoulder buttons how am I meant to drift without shoulder buttons okay forget that let's test the AI the supposedly lifechanging AI That's the sole reason this thing's price was increased from $200 to $400 hi Scarlet  weather tell me anything tell me anything useful it crashed maybe I can ask it to drift for me in racing game since I have no shoulder buttons this whole thing is just absolutely terrible
every angle of this sucks it's Android 11 so it's 4 years out of date I have doubts about the update schedule on this device oh and I really love this Personal Touch he's added to the side of the console he's angled the power button 80Â° off from where it normally is what a guy does it not also look like one of those devices use in hospitals to bring people back to life like except this might actually be the thing that kills me okay so this is Call of Duty mobile none of the controls work so
settings oh my God the res ution of the screen is so poor I can barely read the text in the menus it's just such a lazy product they haven't done like the base layer of programming required to make these controls detectable in most games well I guess what soldja boy said was true in life you either Crank that soldja boy or he cranks you and we're the ones you got cranked here you get a very prestigious zero out of 10 not even on the board okay we are in the tens of millions at this point I think it's
pretty fair to say that anyone Beyond this point is like world famous starting with Harry Kane who's kind of a football legend this guy scored 66 goals in his 98 International appearances making him the highest goal scorer ever for England and basically meaning that in any given game he is more likely to score than to not score which feels like a wild statistic so with all his Goodwill Kane has recently launched his own brand of sustainable Electronics called our Pure Planet there's like a hundred things
here from them I'm going to pick one of them let's review the speaker I got to say Kane this website feels completely dead very much like some eagle-eyed business person has seen some well-priced generic Tech from China they want to drop ship it to wealthy westerners but then realized they needed a name to push it so he said hey Harry can we borrow you for a day to do a photo shoot with them I mean every single one of these photos is shot with Harry Kane in one of two outfits so I'm
now thinking 2hour photo shoot Max you know what's making me think this is it's just the fact that these products look so soulless they have no identity or consistency Beyond just this one logo so I guess if these have been designed from scratch then Harry buddy you got to get yourself a new designer oh no that is the epitome of generic startup sounds it's like they picked from the generic speaker bingo card this is just so lazy I can't believe it I don't know if you're going
to get Harry Kane have him say Bluetooth mode on it would add some value have you heard him speak well I've not seen the pen back but from my point of view do look like okay so you've got one set of speakers facing this way one set facing this way so you have some directional audio it doesn't sound terrible but at the same time I have heard $30 speakers that have more detail than this nothing about this Tech feels at all worth $130 I guess the only saving grace is how much you value
the sustainability they say that every single speaker is 100% carbon neutral and 200% plastic regenerative but there's always an asterisk with these things no one is saving the planet by buying speakers if you actually care about sustainability buy a used one on eBay so boring product not very good for the price you sir have earned yourself a four at 18 million followers well before he got suspended and then eventually deactivated his Instagram account it's Kanye West or I guess yay nowadays and
his stem player speaker now we have actually covered one of these before in one of our gadgets videos but I think this thing is fascinating it looks like an alien it feels like a bag of skin but hidden inside is actually an artificial intelligence that can take any song and break it down into its various different stems like the Baseline drums vocals Etc allowing you to control each one of them on the Fly power it on it's actually such a cool looking product so I'm playing a song right now and you can see
in real time stripping out the various individual elements so that right there is the  it does feel just a little bit like magic the problem though is well a it's not a good sounding speaker considering the price you pay for it it actually makes Harry kanes look like good value oh and also the only way to load music onto it is to use the stem player website which processes the track and then you have to download it and put it onto your stem player manually pretty much immediately relegating this to cool
toy that you probably won't use so I was thinking a six just because of how cool the thing is but minus one point for trying to make his d 2 album exclusive to the stem player effectively charging people $200 just to listen to it now from someone who well still has Instagram it's the actress Drew Barrymore and this lady has done a lot you know the little girl in the ET movie that's her host of her own talk show that's her one of Charlie's Angels yeah still her and now add to that list owner
of the company Beautiful by Drew who made this popcorn machine I got to say though not the highest quality better kit it feels like most celebrity products by default go specifically for luxury whereas this feels quite light and cheap which is fair enough it's only $34 but I guess I don't think you'll find this proudly displayed in Drew Barrymore's kitchen as her pride and joy so one measure of popcorn goes in there I actually skipped dessert today so this is kind of perfect and this also now apparently
doubles as a butter melting tray yes please oh wow okay we're cooking with gas oh my goodness you can see the cyclone in action the seeds are actually rotating and this is actually the air fryer of popcorn machines I guess because instead of oil it uses cyclonic airflow technology which is the same principle that dys and fans use supposedly to maintain even cooking temperature throughout it's definitely not an immediate process it is oh wait wait uh Joseph this is smoking oh
God okay I'm going to turn that off wow I think we got it working again wait why is it why is the entire thing put it in butter I wanted that on my popcorn not my machine all right we're smoking up again on the inside I'm going to call it there well I got to say pretty terrible impression of this product so far none of it has reached my bowl oh God still smells good I'll give it that melted butter oh wo then actually little top tip for homemade popcorn cinnamon butter and
sugar add some of that on top all right  give me like five bu Mor cheers that was delicious but I take 100% of the credit that was not delicious because of Drew Barrymore and her cheaply made oil covered Transformer destroying half cooking popcorn machine drewberry 4 no two Barry more Hillary Duff is up next actress singer author and businesswoman with 26.9 million followers so she is officially ahead of our YouTube channel which I'm sure she's had a big celebration about watch out
though I might just have to build world's largest Hillary Duff and her company below 60 has built their own Cent diffuser and I thought this was interesting below 60 isn't referring to degrees of temperature instead it refers to 60Â° south of the Equator a Latitude that encompasses only ocean near Antarctica which is supposedly where the freshest air on Earth is the website says this thing redefines fragrance design with the following features oh yeah so there's a magnet on the plug and
the fragrance just snaps in place although it is leaking I mean the one job of a container is to stop it doing that okay adjustable horizontal and vertical plug so you can just take this and snap it into two different orientations which I have to say is kind of a genius idea cuz like because the scenter diffuser is kind of thick you'll want to be able to rotate it away from the plug next to it just so it doesn't obstruct it and then fragrance strength control well that's a bit of a stretch
it's got high low and off so there's three different scents there's if Citrus were a feeling it's got like orange and lime and Sandalwood and spices mint disco on ice smells like a spa mixed with a candy shop so good vanilla buys a time share in Paradise H that's like a panina colada it's nice okay so the scents are like addictively good the only question on my mind is is this actually any better than a cheaper simpler and frankly more aesthetic pleasing readed diffuser in
theory this is meant to gently warm your fragrances to encourage evaporation but let's come back later to find out if that's true or not Olivia Rodrigo a name you probably never heard a few years ago and now you can't stop hearing about with 37.8 million followers has collaborated with Sony to design her version of the link buds which feels like a pretty off thee beaten path cultured choice or you know Sony offered her a bucket load of cash so this whole purple exteror is her
signature color U but to be very honest I don't think she's done a very good job with it maybe it was meant to look pearlescent and like a piece of jewelry but to me it just looks like a used pencil erazor at least it is using recycled materials cuz like you can tell one thing though that I think is really cool and might be able to save it is two custom sound profiles tuned by Rodrigo and her producer for the optimal listening experience of her albums guts and sour and I guess there is something
really cool about knowing that you're getting the exact same audio experience that she's had and that she endorses for her own music let's give it a go so right now I'm listening to her sour album without the sour sound profile H I would say the earphones sound pretty good but they're a little bit flat they don't have the base response that I would want and also I think part of it is on her album I think it's not recorded in the best environment for optimal listening you know there's some
artists who when you listen to their tracks on really good earphones you just know that they've obsessed over recording the track right let's switch over to the sour sound profile H okay I changed my mind it's actually kind of lazy they both sound basically the same as each other and they both sound almost the same as just the flat neutral sound profile so I guess the idea is cool but it's not enough to make it a unique proposition nor is it enough to make not so great earphones sound
amazing so I would say it's not a scandal but she's taken a pretty mediocre product and to be honest with this design she's actually made it slightly worse so I think you can have a four wow this is actually a really poor show is anyone even going to reach the upper half now just before we get to the top three celebrities the ones with hundreds of millions of followers turns out that Will Smith is actually the global Ambassador for insta 360 this video sponsor and they have absolutely nailed
it with their new X4 camera for two reasons one you know that famous bending over backward scene from The Matrix movie well they use no fewer than 120 photo cameras all around to capture every single angle equipment totaling well over "$200,000 the insta 360 X4 allows you to" achieve the same bullet time effect with one camera and it records that at 5.7k resolution but there is more so we give this a little Kickstart to get it going and then pull down the trigger oh oh oh
oh my God Fernando uh-oh uh-oh how do you stare this how do you steare this okay abandon two the the whole benefit of 360 cameras is that they record every single angle at once so you never miss anything the downside is that this often adds an extra step cuz you might want to go through and tweak which way the camera is looking at every single point but now you don't even have to do that anymore because the AI editing will do it for you in seconds so check out the link in
the description for the insta 360x 4 a 10% discount a free bullet time handle and an invisible selfie stick so the scooter is it's fun I think this is me realizing that I really like E Scooters as opposed to I really like Alonzo's product it's pretty standard like I mean there's a light which we've seen a lot of very bright flashlights on this channel this isn't really one of them and there's just not many bells and whistles to it except that one but it's got a kick oh no ram
ram I think you can have our first ever six out of 10 right we're in the big leagues now with 121 million followers It's Real Madrid footballer Killian mbappe and he has also released a portable speaker but this one's very promising with 100 watts of Music power compared to I'd guess the 30 watts of Harry Kane speaker and the three watts of the speakers inside your phone holy moly the color on this thing a slightly hilarious attempt at branding on their website inspired by the sporting
achievements of football star Killian mbappe we've made a speaker I mean the guy's a fantastic dribbler but how did you get to speaker from there this one is pretty exciting because the company that manufactures it is called L they're a luxury Speaker Company they have a normal Bluetooth speaker which cost 99 but then with mbappe they've worked together to design the pro which is 249 so are we being scammed or has Killian gone and scored oh this is actually super unique there's a touch bar on the
actual body of the speaker that allows you to adjust the volume the base and the treble although do they not think to put a slightly brighter LED on the inside considering you can see the rest of the speaker from the moon so let's take it for a spin oh okay you really feel the the thump that comes with 100 watts of amplification here your base is going up now going all the way God uh okay so this is a good powerful speaker but it's exactly what it looks like you know when
you see this Basse slider that you can adjust to some infinite degree it makes you think that it's going to be one of those speakers like the dvla Phantom that I tested a while ago that can just completely defy its Dimensions this is not that when you dial up the bass it literally just tweaks a software setting that adds in more base at the cost of everything else and it sounds kind of Muddy adjusting The Equalizer with your music is not some sort of magic trick that makes music sound better and that's
all this is really but you know decent sound it's water and temperature resistant it's got 24-hour battery life it doubles as a power bank and well you're not going to lose it all right G on then 6 out of 10 basically just for doing what you say on the tin number two then is none other than Kim Kardashian we're now at levels of Fame that I don't even understand like how does one even start to get 361 million Instagram followers but anyway she has worked together with Beats by Dre to create her
own custom version of The Studio Pros so she's launched this in three colors all personally curated by her called Moon Dune and Earth what is up with Kim Kardashian trying to turn the entire world flesh toned actually can't decide if I like it or not it makes it look and feel very premium but at the same time time it makes me feel like I'm carrying around a bag of foundation wherever I go and then you've also got this custom cable which weaves together the Fabrics of all three of the colors she's made so
that they only have to make one cable for all three products let's give him a listen I actually haven't tested beats in a while but these are not the products they used to be they're actually easily the best sounding audio products in this entire video but don't get too excited nothing's been over a six so obviously Kim Kardashian didn't make beats but she pck a good product to partner with and she made it look better for some people so congratulations Kim you're the proud recipient of a s out of 10
oh wa that is nice not subtle at all and I love it oh yeah it's definitely warmed up which is just going to accelerate the natural evaporation process only thing that how on Earth are we already like halfway through the fragrance like when I bought this reed diffuser this was full to the brim with fragrance so that's like 10 times the volume of this little cartridge so I guess it's here for a good time not a long time yeah I could see this becoming a very expensive hobby to keep fueling but she's made her
own company it's not a Rebrand of someone else's product and it does what it says on the tin better than basically any other scent diffuser I've tried so you can have a high eight not a dff you want to know who we have at the very top though it's well arguably the most famous person on the planet Cristiano Ronaldo who also happens to be the co-founder and face of consumer electronics brand Rock and also now the fastest growing YouTube channel of all time what does this say rock is more
than my brand it's a reflection of my mission to live life loud okay so he's all in on this apparently and these are his earphones and so what kind of earphones does the most famous person on the planet use well I hope he uses his own earphones it'd be pretty funny if he's actually just an airpods guy although oh my goodness me this is Photoshop you can very clearly see that the earphones have been added into the image afterwards I don't think there's a single photo of him actually using these
this looks like a render too well that's not a good start okay the fit is secure thanks to these fins that kind of Lodge themselves in your ears that makes sense he plays football he doesn't want them to fall out while he's running oh man that's not the best really is it this is like this is the definition of fine the thing is right it's not expensive to make decent in earphones and that is all these are they're just very Baseline in quality like even though these are priced at
like $130 $140 I'm genuinely thinking $7 manufacturing cost there's nothing about the sound or the feel or the technology on offer here that makes it any more sophisticated than that they did also say that this cable has Kevlar embedded inside of it which you shouldn't be able  Ronaldo it was Zero resistance so the product works it's just grossly overpriced for what it is and also kind of misleading with the way it's marketed two out of 10 there of an own gold that one so there you have it this video was
a little different so let me know if you liked it and if you want to see a followup with YouTuber products
