the new DJI Neo could change drones forever here's what so you've seen DJI drones before you've seen that they can shoot beautiful 4K Ultra stabilized footage but what you haven't seen is this hey fly this drone doesn't even need a controller you can use a remote or motion controller or the phone's app to manually control it but even without that it has six different quick shot modes like for example this front follow mode which locks onto your face kind of like a Paparazzi or Circle where it
literally does a 360Â° lap of view and Records a clip of the entire thing that is just insane all right you can take a rest it's also got full coverage propeller guards to both stabilize the Drone and also protect it but here's what I think is the smartest bit you can use this to record Vlogs see the problem with drones is that drones make a lot of noise and so if you stick a microphone on your drone all it's going to capture is so what DJI have done is allowed your phone to capture the audio and remove
that background noise and a drone to capture the video
