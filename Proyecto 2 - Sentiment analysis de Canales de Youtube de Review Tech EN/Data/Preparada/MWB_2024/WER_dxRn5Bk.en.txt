$1 phone case versus $50 phone case for $1 you will get a case you just won't get much more than that it obviously feels quite cheap it's a little bit sticky it attracts a lot of fingerprints and you can actually see if you look closely it's yellowing around the sides but for basic drop protection it would do the job $25 gets you something much higher quality it gives you basically no yellowing at all it's got air cushioned Corners that give you literally military grade protection but also mag safe so
your wireless chargers can just snap into place on the backat $50 though can get you something top end like the tauras oan this video is sponsor this is everything that the $25 case does but with a two-piece construction so the back is smooth and matte but the sides are grippy and there's also raised edges to protect both the screen and the cameras but this is by far the best beit it's not just that oand went absolutely nuts with the quality of magnet Taurus is the original brand who turned the
magnet into a holder to stop you dropping it it's a stand to keep your phone upright when you're scrolling or being incredibly lazy it also rotates oh that L which means you can do that in any orientation
