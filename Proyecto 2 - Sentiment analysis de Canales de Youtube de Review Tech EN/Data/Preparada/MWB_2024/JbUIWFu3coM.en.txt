$5 versus $50 handheld fan so this is a $5 fan and that's actually a very decent blowing capacity although not close to blowing out that candle plus it's also not rechargeable so you'd have to replace the batteries yourself for $10 you can get something quite a bit beefier which is also fully rechargeable and lasts 3 hours per charge Let's Get It On well that doesn't seem very powerful it's got multiple levels wow oh my God it's actually close but $50 gets you the G life Pro 1s this video is sponsored
wow oh my God wait does that mean it's only on 52% power that means you can set this to 100 different levels of power and see which one you're on on the LED display 80 90 100 and also fancy aluminium alloy body it's got fast 18w charging via USBC and it gets you 15.5 hours per charge they even have a safety lock on the back all right let's go oh no no no no that's gone well that is just ridiculous
