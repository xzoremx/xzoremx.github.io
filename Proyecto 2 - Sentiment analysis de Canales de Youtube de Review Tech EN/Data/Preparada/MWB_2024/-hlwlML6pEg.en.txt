open the gates that's Mr Beast and this is how he's about to pull off the highest budget biggest production YouTube video ever created storming this "field is 2,000 contestants look at him" "there 2,000 people competing for that $5" million so how on Earth do you run and record a competition show for this many people and the biggest question how much does it cost to pull all of this off well it wasn't without some very real challenges but one thing's for sure from a technical perspective this is
absolutely insane and I'm giving him all access to everything behind the scenes from the cameras the logistics and he's going to show it all to you and also that's $5 million real doar don't rob me so there are four challenges that the contestants are going to be going through this is us just before the first I gathered all the guards over here so you can test them they're not supposed to show motion basically just like mannequins you guys are not supposed to speak this feels mean they're not going
to talk but they are going to dance if you catch them after hours that's right ladies and gentlemen that's not his real skin for challenge one in which the contestants had to split up into five groups and each group had to pull up a very heavy Boulder as fast as they could every person in the losing team gets "eliminated I realize there's 2,000" contestants behind me shouting and screaming but this is the coolest thing for me right now so this structure right here has been custom built for this
challenge to basically regulate the amount of pulling Force required to lift that Boulder so the Rope feeds through this contraption before it goes out to the contestants and the way that it's weaved through on the inside determines how easy it is to pull so just to give you an idea of how important this is the Beast team originally set this mechanism "up to require 32,000 Newtons of pulling" Force but it's only as they started to play test it a few days before with a whole extra crew of play testers by the
way let move in a little bit they "realized 32,000 Newtons is going to take" people way too long for the challenge to be fun to watch so just by weaving this rope through the Contraption in a slightly different way they could quickly lower the required pulling Force "to just 10,000 oh and also this" microphone here is sat there specifically to capture just the sound of effect of the Rope being pulled it's a little bit crazy just how many things you have to think about if you want to
do this right even literally the flooring Jimmy decided that he wanted this place to look like a Coliseum so they pulled out every single bit of AstroTurf from it and then they've covered it with these Olive pits to basically give it that cinematic sand being thrown up ceiling when people are running around through it this is the Box camera we're using to adjudicate as soon as one of these Boulders cross the finish line that's the winner and so we'll be able to see from this camera
which boulders and that team's eliminated didn't even occur to me that you need adjudication cameras we set our camera at the same height as this finish line so we can see exactly who won they're both at 80 ft so every single contestant also has an NFC wristband that they're scanning to keep track of who's in the game and who's out of the game when you're out they'll know that you need to go out too if you leave we're not leaving you're not leaving we're not leaving okay it took around 3
hours after revealing this first game before the thing actually kicked off partly to give the teams time to strategize partly because everything takes longer than you expect when you're  ready wow this game genuinely lasted about 15 seconds in total and it was specifically designed to be that way oh my god that's literally it red team is done we just lost out on this chance to win $5 million we not Le I can't believe how quickly that happened Mr Beast wanted to make sure that the first game people saw
was as easy to explain as possible and as quick to finish as possible not so much for the people here but more so that the viewers of the final video are able to get easily invested without feeling like they're suddenly having to learn something really complicated you can actually see people in that queue they're so defeated some of them are crying you know when you watch Mr Beast videos online and you think it can't be like that in real life the feeling is  here I  too you all watch our videos love your
videos oh my God Ricky Ricky you guys must feel like top of the world right now it was so nerve-wracking so nerve-wracking does that scare you like seeing what the other teams can do I can't be scared we're we're a part of History here well I'm rooting for you guys personally cuz you're fans yellow team you heard that yellow team yellow team yep I heard that all right yellow team for the win and now while we waited for game two to start now felt like as good a time as any to head to the main
camera room to see the belly of the Beast and while the camera team were out actually filming the show who better to show us this room than Mr Tariq since the last time I saw you a lot has changed from the equipment to how we go about things to the lighting you've seen the scale of the projects has to be better and Jimmy's not as particular about the cameras anymore so he used to be really in the weeds with it now it's like I trust and I like it so these are just the ground cameras they'll be for
talent they'll be just for close-ups on any of the contestants just like a grabb and go run and capture that moment this is very rigged up very rigged up yeah I noticed every single one of these cameras has a light on it darker images don't perform better retention wise at least is what we've learned and then we have the time code here it's just so we make sure everything is time coded ah yes the time code so they bought one of these devices to plug into every camera on this shoot for one job so whenever it
goes to editing they know exactly what happened and when it happened so for example if somebody Falls and it's a really funny moment every single camera you could just search for that second and you'll have 100 viewpoints of that one shot almost 500 for this kid almost 500 I'm curious how the rig has evolved a lot heavier we have more stuff especially like tailored for editing better mic the signal just makes it easier to grab it and just get everything you need in one shot holding
this for about 5 minutes I can see why there's an ex St ATT T oh yeah I mean you get some strong soldiers so that's the Run and Gun cameras there's 28 of those and they are pretty high spec "totaling $100,000 in value the only one" of these that's a tiny bit different is Mr be personal camera rig which has two lights on it instead of one to make him the brightest thing on screen so that your eyes are naturally drawn towards him there's a whole corner copia of lenses and they all have different
purposes you guys use GoPros a lot but GoPros capture like a very different kind of shot to something like this is there a difference in what shots you use for what purpose emotional shots we try to do telephoto so we put somebody on the other side and just zoom in on their face as much as you can and then just kind of get that reaction you'll see a lot of the most vulnerable real moments on Mr be videos being captured like this because the camera is so far away that the contestant isn't spotting it and so
isn't acting for it but that is far from the full Suite of camera G here there's 35 Sony fx9 Cinema cameras dotted all around the stadium to get the main wide fixed shots of the games there's 10 pan tilt Zoom or PTZ cameras which are also fixed in place but can be remotely operated to control what they're looking at 20 DJI Osmos for handing to the contestants to Vlog certain sequences since they are literally the easiest cameras to operate all rounded off with 400 I kid you not 400 GoPros they use
these cuz they're small enough to fit inside of things and also just blend into the background so they don't appear in the rest of the camera's shots and that's not even factoring in all of the accessories like power banks for every single GoPro and also the proper Flagship camera gear like the Box cameras the sky cameras and the whole Army of drones but we are getting to that I noticed everyone's got delightful little nicknames for the different SE SE and so hot and cold for this battery
section I assume hot means fully charged cold means empty yes it's exceptionally organized you can tell this is someone's job to create this pile absolutely Tariq then took us to Mac who is the lead editor of the Mr Beast team why he so tall man he's all dressed up he's tall and he pulls me out when I'm in my underwear and I'm all short sticks me right on camera I am not short that's all we came here for yeah and now that we' establish that Mac definitely isn't short I thought well Mr Beast videos are
pretty much the most consistent highly viewed videos on the internet so given how involved Mac is especially in the intros of them how do these guys make sure that they perfectly capture your attention at the start the way we look at intros basically just like a continuation of the thumbnail most people don't have YouTube premium right and so they'll click on a video then they'll watch like a minute out or 5sec out and skip it whatever they do they will literally forget what they clicked
on so what kind of things have you thought about with this video specifically the intro we were thinking about basically flying camera back instead of flying camera forward I want to see Jimmy's face I want to see the $5 million cash prize and I also want to communicate spect the other thing I thought was really interesting about the intro shot is they filmed it on two separate occasions across 6 hours of time giv that the intro is the single most important 10 seconds of the entire
video these guys actually set up and recorded the full thing once before any contestants had even arrived when they have the time to make sure that they have one intro that they know works but then once again with all the contestants just in case that take ends up having better energy is there a shortage of shirts I just keep ripping them I'm not the is short I'll tell you what isn't short the amount of footage that these guys' editors have to get through but there's a solution to that we have the
best editors in the world if we have 10 hours of footage it gets sunk the assistant editors will take it down to 2 hours of what's usable like a really great editor an editor that can do videos at this level I can't find them anywhere and so preserving them and preventing them from burning out as much as possible is like the name of the game thank you dude you're a legend I love your videos by the way actually your editors are really good don't get any ideas man you guys looking a jump ship
no I'm just kid all right let me take this off okay we're going to call it for tonight after the first challenge the timing on this is absolutely crazy my brain is so fried it doesn't feel like 3:42 a.m. yeah I guess there fluorescent lighting all around the place can you see my face here by the way this is the face of a man who's been awake for nearly 24 hours because of the sudden decision change today to switch from Day filming to night filming in fact scheduling just
generally was easily one of the toughest parts of the shoot because instead of the original plan of 2 days of filming it actually ended up being three nights not to we've mentioned and the extra 3 days around those three nights that everyone involved in the shoot had to make sure they were always ready for not easy for anyone involved contestants included I'm just kind of used to it usually we end up filming deep into the night like this at night I can point lights and control where your focus is
during the day you see everything so I prefer to film at night I mean it's  up okay night two game two so in this game contestants will stand around a whole load of briefcases they look at a board which will tell them which briefcases are safe and which will get them eliminated and then they will have to get to one of those safe briefcases before anyone else can so what's going through your mind right now well I just honestly want to make sure the briefcases get put out right I just want
to make sure it all looks good we have a lot of writing on this shoe one thing you've talked about a lot is the way you tell stories is that changing go watch a Mr Beast video from 3 years ago I'll be like 50% louder it'll be like 50% faster yeah and you'll get like a headache you're making like a purposeful effort in this video for example just just slow down exactly let some moments just sit Trust that people will watch because you know they're very invested in the story
as opposed to like being tricked into watch because there's like cut cut cut cut cut what time is it right now it's only like 10: right actually yeah it's 9 9:00 p.m. oh yeah this is pretty early this is great like I actually should be awake right now and that's crazy did you talk to the people who got out it feel I felt so bad yeah there was some pretty real tears we tried to make it easier on "them by giving everyone $2,000 that way" everyone at least had something to go home with the first challenge we
eliminated 400 people and since we gave "each of them two grand that's $800,000" the money isn't the only thing these guys have to think about when people are eliminated do you remember these RFID bracelets well this is where they come in again there's some sort of checkout process as well when they entered the arena we scanned so we knew they were here SC baby so we counted that we had "2,000 exactly then we could start the" game then when they got into teams oh so when they sorted themselves you added
that data onto their rfids so that your system knows exactly which team Green Team yellow team then we have all those lists ready it's the same as eliminations so all of the red team that was eliminated even though we knew it was red team just to be absolutely sure we scanned every single one on the way out wow then we know if somebody's missing in the stadium is this because you've been burned before on previous games people are hide did you see the end of that game but Jimmy had to call
her up to tell her that oh come on and red team's out she was a red team contestant he was trying to stay trying to stay in the game yeah so the bracelets are really a way for us to keep track of everybody now if you already thought the shoot was a complicated Affair you have not seen the start of it because it was at this point that I was introduced to a whole new branch of the operation this is Emily and she is a story producer having all of us here and just taking notes of
choses that happen little quotes we hear that would make good content it just overall helps the post-production process so the entire role of these guys is to look and to listen to what's happening on the field to try and figure out what the story is going to be while the video is still being shot so that by the time it ends up in the post- production editing stage that team can be as efficient as possible part of the recruitment process you ask people to send a one minute video of themselves
and you use that to judge their character and their energy and so you're saying as part of that you pick the top tier people and you're like you get a microphone yes 40 contestants are miked up out of the 200000 this board was the initial idea of who would get miked up I think as they meet the people and as people like show their true selves on the field they'll switch it out this is absolutely crazy this is movie investigation pinboard type by once people get eliminated they'll remik
other people obviously like things change and mics change so like we have people designated to go out there and keep track of who gets remake which helps us like tremendously during the post-production process you've got Heroes villains family and then others you've not just pegged people as being main characters but you've pegged that they've got a personality trait that might make them a villain yes so yeah you can't predict the stories that will form but you can predict the people who
are most likely to form them those people are given the microphon so that's fascinating are you listening to those people in real time on the average Beast video will have one person listening so we have six people and then I'm doing like visuals right now everyone gets seven people to listen to so that instead of listening to 40 people at once you only have to listen to seven people so this is the live universal time code and that's synced with all the cameras so you know exactly what's
shooting when and then these are the notes the story editors are leading so this means that when the editors get the footage it will not just automatically slot in at the exact time that each shot was actually taken but they will also get all of this guiding information from the story producers so they know specifically what look for within those shots everything's been thought about yes so that's where all the story producers hang out this is basically Jimmy's private viewing Suite so whoa
it's basically the same thing but this room is specifically designed for Jimmy to come and have a kind of one glance view of every single thing that's happening so you can give really quick feedback in between him being on camera there's a lot of screens here so there's 18 TVs in this one room quite impressed with the uh the bezels on these as well it almost looks like one continuous video War they're bringing out the briefcases for the next game should probably go you know what's extra crazy
about this because everything that happens in the stadium is recorded and might end up being part of the video even the setup of things needs to be a rehearsed Affair it took 100 people nearly an entire day just practicing how to set this one game up lining up these briefcases figuring out how to enter the stadium in an organized way timing the process to make sure it doesn't drag and also measuring to make sure that every table was exactly qu distant I hate when it's like day of and we do those things
and it's not choreographed cuz it just looks very amateur when it's all time to choreograph then we can timelapse it it can be like bring out the briefcases but if it's not like sped up time lapses good so it has to come out in an organized way that looks good when it's fed up yeah or then it just looks weird it's perfect for retention oh my god dude I love you more this Beast I should say that oh my God is that on camera no it's not yes it delete it right now please go all right three
two go look like I see a people oh  reveal R can't believe you're getting reactions like this at 4:00 a.m. in the morning but now seeing this game being filmed there's another question that's been looming on my mind where does all the footage from all of these cameras actually go this is the dit room these guys are guess you could say the very important but very unsung heroes of this project cuz their entire job is to make sure that no piece of footage goes missing which when there's like 500
cameras on a shoot is a bit of a logistical problem so the whole process starts with these drives someone will physically run into this room with a box full of these drives what these guys are doing is taking the footage on that drive and categorizing it based on which game that footage is from which camera recorded that footage and which type of microphone picked up the audio for that footage which sounds like an absolute nightmare of a task but they're doing it so that when the editors are editing the
footage all they need to do is to just think which bit of footage do I need as opposed to having to rummage through like a 100 different folders to find it but it will make the edit like 10 times faster right now this is where the fund begins they plug these drives into their computers which are all Mac Studios by the way because well I'm told they don't like Windows but then those Mac studios are wired into something called an ingest station which is eight very large
hard drives every single one is 20 terab meaning that one ingest station has a max capacity of 160 and then you realize that there's 20 of these ingests in this room so 3.2 petabytes of storage but it gets crazier because they're shooting this show for Amazon Amazon have insisted that they have at least three layers of backup for every single bit of footage so as well as these ingest stations every single drive has never getting AR raas it will just stay as a permanent hard copy of everything that's
been recorded and then every single one of these in stations has has a fiber cable coming out the back of it this is a very fast connection we're talking 25 GBS per second there's a very specific reason for this fiber cable and we can actually follow it out of the room way out of the room still going still going still going and you follow that cable all the way around and you end up with this which is basically just one massive server and that serves as the third layer of backup it almost seems stupid
just how many precautions are being taken but then when you start to adding up how much they're spending to make the show it starts to make sense how much they're spending to keep the show this room is actually particularly cool for a few more reasons because these are video recording boxes so you know how it normally works with a camera you record onto an SD card that's inserted inside but these guys are doing it a little bit differently because every single one of the fixed cameras dotted around the
stadium is physically wired all the way across the stadium into these boxes and that has two pretty major benefits one that instead of recording on tiny fiddly little SD cards they record onto proper drives but also too some of these cameras are no joke 100 m up in the air so imagine how much Manpower it would require to individually keep track of every single camera so that it doesn't run out of storage and then swap over the SD cards when it does but with this setup one person could literally man
everything this is also super interesting so because this recording actually happens over a really long time like I think we hit record at 10: p.m. it's now 3:12 in the morning the lighting changes so this guy over here is actually in real time adjusting the color temperature the black levels the saturation of the cameras to make sure that they stay consistent both as the time of day changes but also between the many different types of cameras being used on the shoot because if you just
left each one alone they would all naturally take footage that looks slightly different to each other this is the video router so it's the Box in which every single one of the video signals that you see comes through first to be able to be distributed to all these separate monitors so long story short if this box goes down so does the entire video which is why there's a 24/7 fan just blowing cool air at it so do you remember the pan tilt Zoom cameras that we talked about earlier well this
room is also where those are being remotely operated from and the beauty of these cameras is they allow you to follow the action so let's say I find a disruption happening with these briefcases I can find where that disruption is happening and then I can just zoom in all the way onto that disruption so it's allowing me from a distance to create these really stable cinematic sub stories within the biggest that gets so close you forget that the camera is positioned right on the very
end of the stadium it's just blowing my mind that all of this like all of this is the back end for one YouTube video just to be super clear do not go until I actually say the word goo he's our guy look up at the screen all right there you go see I'm oh actually I said it you're right oops oh my God I messed up but hey I think he's pied to losing have to be great how are you feeling nervous yeah I can see it on your face is it you versus every single person around you are
everyone thinks I'm out really oh man yeah how will you feel if you are it's fine it's my dad's birthday today is that worth losing $5 million it's literally called Rick e  [Applause] K I'm with that I decided that's enough Beast games for today too much heartbreak 4:40 a.m. we're heading back that feels like a victory early yeah early the time had come it was time for the third final and most chaotic night of all starting with the flag game where all contestants are going to line up on
one side of the field and each round a varying number of flags are brought into the middle contestants have to decide which round they're going to make a run for it and when they do they have to make sure they grab a flag while they're at it or they're out knowing that in total there aren't going to be enough flags for every player where they make the first like two or three like really easy so they get it and then after that we're going to do dozens of rounds I want you guys to be super dumb is there
a dominant strategy you think there's a lot of strategy to this I would probably pick one quadrant and just be like well there's a flag here I'm going no matter what I'm going no matter what I like really try to talk everyone around you out of it it was also at this point that I managed to get hold of something that you never really get to see so these are prev visualizations of the Amazon thum thil and it's absolutely crazy like how these were pre visualization Mr who
do not draft things is a clear favorite so far I think this one wins they have one version of this thumbnail poster image based on like 15 of the most popular movies and games from fortnite to money Heist to How to Train Your Dragon and this is the one they ended up picking from them before long the first flag it was time for the flag game to begin as soon as I blow this horn the round will begin I won't lie to you I found this game absolutely fascinating to watch oh look those two are racing for flag
one it started off so organized with a few of the louder people basically making it very clear to the others around them that they were going to run for it so that no one else tries to but then as the game went on you start to notice that order breaking down because you can't stay on the sidelines forever because they will just run out of flags so this just got more and more chaotic there a tiny little drone up there zipping around the stadium I think we should find out who's flying it wait
he's up there he literally looks like an imperial staffle Commander I think this is the one we've seen zipping all around the stadium like extremely quickly yeah this one this one as well oh yeah this looks very like homemade almost yeah they're all custom built did you do it yeah you made them yeah yeah custom built and then the gimbals are my designs who are you medin drum a few years ago I tried out the idea of using a head tracking to gimal just to see if it would help with camera correction and
it ended up just being so much better than I expected you didn't just build the drones you built the entire system the head tracking system this tilt following my head yeah yeah wow previously fpv is always flown fixed angle which is where the piloting camera and usually GoPro are fixed to the Drone but the problem is that really limits the shots you can get like you can't like look down or anything yeah with this this gives you a full 5° of Freedom which pretty much means you can
accelerate in any direction while looking in any direction so you're controlling the movement with this controller yeah exactly and your head is looking up and down movement is controlled by controller tilt movement is via HED rcking there's two cameras here one is the GoPro itself one is down here what is that doing so this is our piloting cam this is what I'm seeing in my goggles and then this is our recording cam of course of course right cuz you can't stream directly the GoPro
yeah exactly that is absolutely incredible so this compared to like the big skycam that's overhead what's the perk of this uh perk of this is I can get inside of the crowd I'm not limited by my like range I can go up into the stand dive in do you get dangerously close for fun yeah yeah so because there's less Flags in this round he's been given permission to take off with the bigger drone you know cuz if there was like 100 across the field you've got a pretty good chance with that of whacking someone in the
face whoa oh my god let's go have a look at the footage that is absolutely amazing so there's two types of drones being used on the shoot they've got 10 of the more standard DJI drones and if you look here you can see that those are the ones responsible for these slower more cinematic shots but then this guy with his first person view drone his job is to get really close and get these super unique in the crowd action-packed chaos shots if you have an idea and you think it might or might not work it's
worth exploring cuz I didn't think this would work before I tried it and now it's changed my life so it's like wow good for you man that's cool team come true oh yeah also look a little closer at the seats in every single one of the "65,000 seats in this Stadium just for" this video These Guys printed out and fitted a full-sized Slender Man only for the production team to later decide actually no that looks a little weird well that's a shocker and then send people out for a second time to flip
"every single one of those 65,000" Slendermen around to the blank side so now you only see their faces when you're up in the stands but now it was time to get closer to the most serious pieces of camera gear on this shoot this is the kind of stuff that you don't normally get to see like this starting with the sky camera which is being controlled from a box all the way in the top corner of the stadium so this is the aerial camera room this is I guess where the magic happens yeah you guys are the sole
controllers of the sky cam yeah got the pilot right here I move the camera rig in space up down left right my operator Kirby over there pans tilts zooms focuses and gives us the best shot as possible oh I see it's like a tank turret versus driver exactly patchy helicopter I've never heard that comparison but yeah that go wow this is some of the most beautiful footage I've seen in my life what makes this different to a drone safer it can't ever fall out of the air and hit anybody we
have a larger camera Lar larger sensor larger lens so we can create a little bit better image than most drones can explain to me what's happening on this computer this is our fly space I can always glance at that and know I'm 56 ft above the turf here is that important because you're trying to stay out of the way of other cameras and their shots and exactly so the coordinates that we use when we first get here we build that fly space and I can put walls barriers obstacles to keep us safe from hitting
stuff so for instance the boulder structure over there I have a wall right here these yellow ones are ramps so we can go up into the sets and not run right into the pile of money yeah and so the camera will now do that automatically now that you've set those constraints indeed so when you go from green to Yellow it will automatically lift if it's too low that's right wow that's a smart bit of Kit and this is fascinating watching you two guys talk to each other cuz you're both
controlling different parts of this camera are you telepathic we've done enough games together that we kind of think along the same wavelength if he's flying a certain direction I know what kind of look is possible from that angle that he's got the rig physically at so then I just pan or tilt Zoom whatever and it makes the shot look good it's like good dance Partners the longer they've been dancing together the better they can read what the other one's about to do you two would kill it on a dance
floor so I'm seeing something and it's upsetting me a little bit are you recording in 1080P no they are receiving 4K just 10p to the monitors so that the throughput is limited this is just for us cuz that would be a massive waste yes indeed it would indeed it would I'm so relieved but it's easy to forget this show isn't just about filming a video it's a very real tournament with very real Stakes so as you've had a taste off earlier these guys also have to make sure that there are proper systems in
place for adjudication so anytime two contestants think that they're the ones who touched the flag first there's a whole Squadron of Staff who have to run to that big dit storage room they have to take the drives that have the footage on they have to run them back to the stadium and then go through that footage from several of the fixed cameras frame by frame until each dispute is resolved and grabs it first the guy on the right would be the one that has possession this guy yeah yeah yeah this is stuff
you don't see in the final Mr Beast video but there are disputes literally every round of every game and you can't move on to the next one until each one is resolved which as you can imagine is another reason why there is so much waiting around when you're on set but also do you notice how every single person working here is wearing a headset well each of those is connected to one of these called a bolero which basically allows you to talk to any other person in the stadium immediately without even
needing to dial a phone number it's a version of like a a walkie SL telephone so you've got a walk which normally you talk one at a time this is kind of like that but I can talk over you this gets rid of the whole over and out Roger yes they're called comms or pl's which stands for party line which is a throwback to early phone lines when you'd have a whole neighborhood or a whole group of people they're all on the same phone number like on your pack here y all the camera guys are on that button
so it's one button to talk to everyone who's been assigned as a camera everyone who has that button we also do a lot of like deployment of antennas there's one right there so those are all over the venue and you guys have installed these all yourself yeah our group of five guys here so you basically created your own mobile phone network inside the stadium yeah just for this one video and that's a wrap on game three and since the team were also determined to not let this go on for another day it
was very rapidly time to set up for the final game well I say very rapidly like I said earlier everything does take way longer than you think but you know it took 3 hours to get everything for this game into position instead of 24 so this final game which is the game that determines who ends up making it to the main Amazon Prime show is a bit of a returning Classic on the Mr Beast Channel this is last to leave so contestants split into teams and each team stands on a pillar except they're
not really teams because Mr Beast will then offer bribes of an increasing value until someone in one of those pillars jumps off accepts the money for themselves and condemns the rest of their team to lose by the end of this challenge one of you will backstab your entire team and to see this game in action we headed to one of the Box cameras wow look at that thing when you're on the ground it all feels like chaos but from up here you can see the action in a very different way so we've
been told that this guy is apparently planning to sabotage the entire event and so the story producers have let this trained operator of the Box Cam know that and so he is staying locked onto this guy like a hawk waiting to see what he does just to try and convey the gravity of this piece of technology this is a 16 mm to 35 mm M lens which basically means you can go Ultra Ultra wide at 16 mm or decently zoomed in at 35 but this this camera right here is 8.4 mm to 832 these are absolutely Bonkers numbers
like the kind of numbers that allow you to view the entire stadium in one shot or go all the way to someone's face who's standing on the opposite side of it and so the total price of one of these bad boys "$100,000 each and there's eight of them" the final game begins reveal what the first Pride will be it'll be "$5,000 no takers he's going to have to" up the state I'll give you 50 Grand oh hasn't started yet the second he announced it abolute cor didn't start that Tim yet oh my go no cuz the Tim
hasn't started yet and that was a very strange rap on game four so now just before we get to the final cost of this entire production the only question left unanswered is this $5 million in cash I cannot believe they actually did that with real money you actually can't get through there without trampling on "$1,000 " bills how did they actually get it see this Mr Beast from JP Morgan Chase total is $5 million you steing some should we I mean probably would have noticed what
do you think of it what do I think of $5 million in cash yeah how does it work to get that amount of money in cash cuz that's obviously not a normal thing that JP Morgan are approached with goes all the way to the top and then you know bring armored trucks with like a little militia to your studio and drop it off that's a fun BTS so that's how they get $5 million as for how they keep it so there's Stadium security on the outside police on the inside armor truck two security guys around the top that just
sit and watch it so if someone made a run for it they would just tackled them it's in ones it's hard to run with a lot of ones I don't know if you've ever tried to lift ones no not that many just one of our team C briefcases proba pounds and so if you run with it I can catch you I'm old we estimate on the "stage right now is 12,000 a Mony" "£12,000 that's the equivalent of two" adult African elephants worth of pure paper notes they did the math so they could build the structure to hold it are
there cameras specifically trained on that money as well yes we put extras on place we spent this entire 3 Days running around counting up the value of all the equipment and Tech that we've seen and so the final cost to make this one YouTube video is well we forgot a few things we got all the staff costs we got costumes which remember every single person here needs an outfit which is printed in house and has to be fitted we got the cost for all equipment used in each game every Boulder every briefcase
and so on we've got the contestant costs "2,000 flights 2,000 Hotel I love how" casually you say that meals three times a day over the course of a week not to mention a total of $2 million just in money given to the contestants who got out for this one episode plus the insane audio gear just to make sure that everyone's voice is picked up and sounds good on video if you have to guess the audio gear in this entire video what is it worth oh millions of dollars but then also stuff like the months of pre-prep
that had to go into designing every game the cost of the Raiders stadium the place where the Super Bowl was held it goes on and on on but there's quite a big saving from the fact that a lot of the equipment you see here is being rented as opposed to bought leaving the final cost figure is $14 million for the video And1 19 million if you include the 5 million prize money
