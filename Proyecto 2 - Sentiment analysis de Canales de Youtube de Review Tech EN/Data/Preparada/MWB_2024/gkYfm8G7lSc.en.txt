this is an iPhone and this is the largest iPhone in the world and just to give you an idea check out how bright this flash is so let's get the thing powered up with the largest USBC Cable in the world this is a completely custom cable designed to deliver a lot of power with two very strong magnets that allow it to do this unlock for the most satisfying button behind every button is a tiny air hole which reduces the speed at which air can pass through making every press
have so much weight every single person is looking at me right now yeah come over have a look pretty cool right 3 2 1 biggest selfie in the world so this is what a normal iPhone flash does to my face it's better than no light but our iPhone does this oh my God feel like I just walked into the sun
