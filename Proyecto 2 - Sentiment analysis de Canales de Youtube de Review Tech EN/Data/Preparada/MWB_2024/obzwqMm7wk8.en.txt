my team has bought and set up five secret spy cameras and they hidden in this room I've got one minute to find them let's go so I'm assuming there's a whole load of decoy gadgets that aren't actually recording this this is the crazy thing about spy cameras though they can actually be in anything nowadays and you would not know I do see a little circle right at the very top this is a spy camera wait wait it's a tiny little cut up here is that a lens this is one of them that is absolutely
terrifying uh you hit a camera would this actually ironically be the most subtle way to hide a spy camera I'm going to say no wa so I've got to find three in not a lot of time what okay wait something here that's a pen and that is a lens I'm pretty sure thing is it's not even bigger than a normal pen to M toying what's this weird alarm clock thingy got a whole load of little bulbs at the bottom which I can only assume are infrared is this one of them yeah okay four out of five let's go I
can't find it I can't find it it go on help me that oh my God you would not even think to question that but it goes to show you really do never know when you're being watched
