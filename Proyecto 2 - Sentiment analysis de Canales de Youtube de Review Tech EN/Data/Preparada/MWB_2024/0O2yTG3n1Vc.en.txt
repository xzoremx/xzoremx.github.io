this is the Humane AI pin it's been blowing up the internet over the last few months with the combined intelligence of sophisticated AI plus the entire internet all being brought to you in a way that you can still be completely present in a moment and not bogged down by the hassle of working around intrusive addictive phone applications and I just went Hands-On with it I spent about 4 hours using it and talking to the CEO Iman and I don't think I've ever wanted to love a piece
of technology so much and yet still be  YouTube finding YouTube video AR man also known as MOS is a popular YouTuber with a focus on technology making him years old so here's how it works it Clips onto your clothing it stays there on standby most of the time and then only when you decide that you want to engage with it do you place your finger on this touchpad and you speak for example when do you think humans will settle on the moon humans are are expected to return to the Moon in 2024
and have the first families on the Moon by 2084 okay so that's pretty cool I guess it can do music in quite an intelligent way could you play me some of Mozart's biggest hits and then this is volume but those are still basic requests the benefit of this being an AI powered assistant is that you can also do things like look at this food and tell me what it is it's a white cardboard box with a clear plastic lid the box contains Fried Chicken nugets do you want to see the coolest party trick
of the century though well bring your hand in front the bakedin camera will see that hand and a laser projector housed inside the pin will fire out your display onto it so this is my home menu the way the controls work it's rotate your hands to select something so if I hover over my home widgets for example and then pinch which is to click I can cycle between them the pin also has a depth sensor so as I move my hand back it knows that and it can show you a contextual quite literally behind the
scenes menu based on what you're doing right now so if I've just taken a photo for example and I want to preview that photo raise your hand you'll see the photo push the hand back and it will give you the menu that lets you pick what you want to do with that photo like share or delete it and then as soon as you're done with something you either clench to go back home or you just put your hand down the pin will know and it will stop the projection almost immediately so is it good well I'm really sorry to
say this cuz Iman the CEO he was so nice in person and he was a great host to us but no I don't think so this is a really interesting category and I have ideas for how this could be something that is pretty great but as of right now the Humane pin is an incredibly poor proposition just before I get into that though I do want to give credit where credit's due there are a few things about this that are spoton and they do make you realize the potential for starters I think they have absolutely
nailed the hardware so long as you decide that you're okay with wearing a chest pin then you probably won't find a better one it's way smaller and lighter than I was expecting and it's got three different kinds of backings which go on the inside of your clothing and magnetically attach one is a super lightweight latch for delicate clothing so it doesn't tug much one is the standard battery booster which is a bit thicker and also wirelessly charges the Humane pin's internal battery and then
you have the most bulky which is the clip that can manually fasten around your clothing and I got to say my entire First Impressions with this thing before I turned the thing on were great the construction feels topnotch with every pin being carved out of a solid block of aluminium and the charging case has a really sturdy hinge with no sign of flexing I think it looks pretty it doesn't have any big garish logos it's quite sleek and futuristic and this trust light that indicates what it's
doing at any moment for you and also I guess for other people around you is super seamlessly integrated the magnets are really strong I even tried running around with it I mean yeah it does flop around a bit if you're wearing a loose t-shirt but I was not at all worried that it was going to fall and here's the final touch that I do think is quite smart the base of the pen is one continuous touchpad so while you don't have a traditional smartphone screen you do have some of that physical touch
experience that you've built up all that muscle memory for so you can use this for example to swipe up and increase your volume or double tap to take a photo or hold down with two fingers to enter interpreter mode which I'll get to in a bit but the best part of it is it means there are no wake words you're not having to start each interaction with hey Humane and that's really really great and there were moments with it where I saw what it could be I asked it what's this tree in front of me and it
told me it's a Japanese maple and there was something incredibly uniquely satisfying about gaining that Insight without needing to be interrupted from the moment with my phone it felt like a cheat code because let's face it as soon as your phone gets involved that becomes your attention anytime you take a photo on your phone you are entirely focused on getting the framing just right anytime you want to look something up you're actually looking down at your hand instead of experiencing or another
example was the one time that we used The Interpreter translation feature and  well hello Imron it is a pleasure to meet you the point is I see it I see the vision and I see small twinges of something magical but when you actually boil it down to the practicality of using this and wearing this every single day I can't see a single angle from which it makes sense I mean the first thing is the price this is a $700 Gadget and $700 $ as a oneoff is maybe just about digestible and you do get
everything you need to use it they also throw in two of the battery boosters in the box which between them is enough battery for a full day of use but here's the problem very little of the AI processing is being done on the device so it needs an internet connection and so because it needs an internet connection it's not just that it basically does nothing when you're out in the middle of nowhere but also it needs its own entirely separate data plan so it's a 700 $ pin plus a $24 a
month subscription on top of that plus taxes and fees and yeah that $24 does also include unlimited AI requests on top of that data but $24 a month is I mean that's two times what I'm paying for my phone contract if you want to go abroad and carry on using the pin which is a big part of its appeal because of this whole translation feature there's an extra fee on top of that and the worst part of it cuz I specifically asked about this the minute that you stop paying that monthly fee the device stops function
so let's say that I use this for 2 years where I've paid $700 for the device $600 for the subscription $200 in extra taxes another $100 for roaming fees and just to finish it all off another $100 for the clip and the latch as they don't "come with it even after $1,700 of" investment into this product as soon as I stop paying my subscription cuz I mean would you plan to pay it for the rest of your life probably not but at that point Humane is basically saying that your PIN
becomes a paperweight so fine it's very expensive but if its capability matches that then maybe it's justifiable well what Imran the founder was saying to me is that the pin has the ability to run not just one but many of the top current AI models so like GPT 4 for example which is a very powerful AI that does usually require its own paid subscription for youus it has that on the go all the time which is definitely not to be sniffed at so one of the things that he was saying he used it for
is when he's driving his phone will be in his pocket his Focus will be on the road but he has access to the entire internet of knowledge so he'll just decide I want to learn something about sleep habits today for example and this pin can bring that knowledge in summarize it and speak it to you and this is actually the first moment where I thought oh that's interesting when Risha my fiance does any kind of long drive she often spends a good half an hour beforehand trying to find a good
podcast to listen to during it and even then they'll often Veer off topic or not be exactly what she was hoping for but this the world's information curated exactly based on what you're asking to hear in any given moment well that could solve it plus the AI pin does understand the flow of a conversation this isn't like old school Siri where you're just reintroducing the topic every single time you bark a new command at it you can talk in a very human conversational way and it talks back so
my head started spinning with the possibilities this idea of a personal teacher wherever you want them but then I tried it hey I'm really struggling with sleep recently uh I'm only getting 5 hours and I keep waking up in the night what should I try and  advice to improve Sleep Quality you can try the following be consistent with your sleep schedule ensure your bedroom is quiet dark and at a comfortable temperature remove electronic devices from the bedroom avoid large meals
caffeine and alcohol before bedtime what I think it lacks is that conversational tone that makes it easy to understand and follow you know when you're listening to a podcast and it's a human speaking with human intonation yeah the fact that it doesn't have that makes it hard for me yes so we're working on some of that at the moment where the conversational piece we're looking at um opening up the microphone for um follow on questions like that yeah so the bubble burst pretty quickly not only is
it much harder to understand than real person the AI doesn't have that natural intonation and it's only without that that you realize how important that it is but it also just takes ages and this was not a one-off everything on the pin  Aaron is it oh there you go it's only having experienced that myself that I realized why in the comp's promotional material they're filling in all the silences by talking make it sounds like jenz and what's cool is you can make it more formal or casual or even do fun
things Oliver how's it going because if they didn't fill in those silences it would be awkward as hell now it's tough to say at this point why everything takes so long like even simple things like sending a text or a call those should be instant offline responses but they're far from it so either this is just a really slow device or the voice processing itself also needs to be done online or this is just the device checking in online each time you ask at something just to make sure that you're
still paying the monthly fee whatever the reason it is a big source of friction could you give me a synonym for the word great and a sub to the channel  be finding synonyms synonyms for the word great include fantastic marvelous talented tremendous and wonderful we'll go for Marvel if human intonation and speed were the only issues though I'd be pretty happy to give Ain the benefit of the doubt because longer term those are fixable things but I think the real problem with
this product it it runs much deeper than that for starters it hallucinates which has become this term to describe how AI can present false information as if it's a fact so for example one of the advertised features is you hold a food in front of you and it tells you what is in it like how much sugar or how many grams of protein but see when I asked it how many chicken nuggets there are in a 20 chicken nugget share boox it said without a hint of caution the box contains fried chicken nuggets there are
14 chicken nuggets in the Box interesting 14 well I think it's cuz it can only see 14 yeah so how on Earth will you ever be able to trust a device's nutritional recommendations if it doesn't even know how much of that food there is I mean I talked to Imran about this and he said well it's not a medical device and the feature is kind of in beta and that's all fair enough but then what it is is an advertised feature either it needs to get much much better very quickly which
I don't think is going to happen because of the natural limitations of what this thing can see or it needs to make you more aware of its limitations so that you know you shouldn't be taking what it says at face value the idea in theory of let's say liking the look of this chair and for the PIN to be able to not just tell you what it is but also save the answer to your notes is appealing but when you actually try and do that you realize what the limitations of this form factor are like you can't see
exactly what it's seeing so I asked this exact question to it about the chair and it gave me a recommendation but then I later realized that the recommendation it gave me was a different chair in the room and that's because when it gives you an answer you have no way of affirming that it's the correct answer unlike when you do the same thing using Google lens on your phone where you can make sure that you're capturing the right chair and then you can physically check that it has identified correctly
one thing that Imran talked about was the incoming AB to buy things using this but given that there's no real screen here would you want to buy things on this like what if I meant to order two of something but the AI pin mishears me and takes that as 20 what if it misunderstands the size or the color of what you're wanting and actually orders an alternative variant there is so much that could go wrong that you'd really want to see an entire purchase page with all the info and you can only do that on
your phone but then also you have to talk to it because there is no physical screen to type on your key input method has to default to speech and there are a lot of times I can think of where I would not want to do that like what if you're in an art gallery or a library or more commonly for people a meeting what if you're texting with your partner and you don't want to broadcast your intimate conversations any search request that might be remotely private you either tell the world or you'll have
to get out your phone anyway and you have the same problem in alloud environment like a concert or a busy train I can tell you for a fact that in the London Underground this will not be able to hear me clearly unless I shout so now it is starting to become a pretty big problem if the fact that the pin will cost you just as much as a topend flagship smartphone wasn't enough can you see this growing number of further Hoops that you still have to jump through like having a permanent required
internet connection the sheer time lag between when you ask it to do something and it actually doing that thing that full 5 to 10c period where you're unsure whether it's thinking or it's failed the answer to which is a pretty even 50/50 split and then the further restriction that comes from there being many different environments in which you either can't or you won't want to use it and that is not even talking about what I think is the biggest limiting factor the app situation it's pretty clear that
one of the key pitures of this AI pin is the ability to lead this appless lifestyle to not be a slave to all these apps that are fighting for your attention and to kind of bring all of these separate previously siloed functionalities into one seamless experience and I really do want to say I respect the vision I love the idea of being completely connected whilst also not needing to bend over so that meta can track my behaviors and Target ads at me accordingly so salute for trying but
given how entrenched we already are in these applications I think this Vision only works if this device can still on some level still communicate with those apps like if I can say to it hey send a WhatsApp message that says this or post a tweet that says this but it can't do that when you message someone it's not a WhatsApp it's not an iMessage it's just a straight SMS message when you take a photo you know I was saying that when you move your hand back it gives you this option to share that photo yeah
well since there's no apple airdrop and there's no Android Quick Share the only way to actually share it is to SMS that person a link to be able to download it like imagine after a party you know when people say oh can you send us the photos you took and then you actually send them an SMS link for them to be able to download those photos one photo at a time at the Humane web Center they're going to think you're some sort of time traveler and not in a good way oh yeah so the Humane web Center this is where
all the stuff on your AI pin gets backed up to every time that it's docked and it's on Wi-Fi and in a way this is kind of cool the company's saying that you get unlimited storage as part of your subscription cost and this web Center is one place where all of your photos your videos your notes all the requests that you've asked it for it all comes together but does that also defeat the entire purpose like okay if the goal of the pin is for you to rely Less on apps but at the same time they're telling you
that it's not not designed to replace your phone then you're still going to be using all your phone apps your Google Drives your Evernotes and you're still going to need to keep paying those subscriptions but now you have a whole extra Suite of Humane apps that your stuff is further scattered across if this pin came out before the first smart phone then who knows maybe it could have set the precedent for a new type of computer with a new way of working but we are in a world now that is built
around the smartphone and given that I do not see a world where a smart device that doesn't actually connect in with any of your existing smart devices is useful as it stands it seems like the only smartphone Style app that currently works on the pin is tidal for music and I can see why it's so limited because I mean both on the developer end because there's very little incentive to create apps for a platform in which you cannot easily advertise and you cannot easily convert people to your other services
but also for the user I mean think about the apps you use how many of them would actually be useful if you didn't have a screen like you wouldn't want shopping apps you'd Miss so much of the content TT of what you're looking at like when you're on Amazon for example you need to see how many reviews there are you need to see what those reviews say maybe scan a few of them you want to be able to see the options for delivery date and importantly if you're being charged to get it faster by losing almost your
entire sense of sight you lose 90% of the information that you require to do useful things and sure you can ask the PIN to dictate the entire web page but that would be exhausting and so much slower the company's currently working on Google Calendar integration so you'll be able to ask your PIN who's in my next meeting what time does it start how long does it go on for but if you actually want a clear instant picture of not just your next meeting but your entire day the app on your phone can give you
everything together in seconds the same is true for all your social media apps it's true for any kind of banking it's true for any form of visual media and the list goes on and just to clarify yes you do have a display of sorts here this whole laser thing but the inherent nature of what it is it naturally limits what it can do it's monochrome it's quite low resol ution and also it's not that bright to the point where Outdoors it's really hard to see and the official advice is actually to just use your
other hand to cup it cool thanks and actually now we really think about it is it even fair to say this counts as hands free like yes technically there is nothing in my hands but at the same time my hands are definitely not free actually quite the opposite the laser does not re aim itself to wherever your hand is there is a specific spot where it fires you need to hold your hand there and you need to keep it as flat as possible your hand is basically your projector screen so the more creased you
keep it the worse your picture quality is going to be I genuinely feel like doing this for 5 minutes is actually ironically much less comfortable than just holding your phone because you can hold your phone in any position you can support it on your lap or on a table and you can just keep moving it and yeah the Humane pin does have a surprising number of features considering there is no physical Hardware like being able to react to messages with emoji but then at that point where you're holding your
hand out you're scrolling around and you're tapping multiple times surely there comes a point where it will actually just be faster to take your phone out and do it there and that brings me on to the gestures you know things like rolling your hand around I totally believe that they are things that you will get used to like I don't think it's fair to say that they're just not good after having used them once and also I totally get that you're not going to be using your hand screen as much as
you would be using your phone screen but what you can't deny is that the total amount of effort required to per perform any given action is just higher with the pin like if you think about what it takes to hover over something with your phone is this if you think about what it takes to hover over something on the Humane pin it's this if you think about what it takes to click something it's that if you think about what it takes to click something over here it's that if
you think about what it takes to go home one swipe if you think about what it takes to go home it's a full clench now why do I keep comparing it to the phone anyways we've already established that it's designed to be a separate device that isn't replacing a phone well because I don't think I've ever seen more overlap in capability between two separate categories of computer cuz look this is an Android phone the Humane AI pin at its very core is also running Android this phone has a Qualcomm
chipset on the inside the Humane pin also has a Calcom chip on the inside they didn't exactly say which but based on the size of this thing and the tiny batteries I'd say it's very likely to not be close to the power of your phone's chip this is trying to be your camera but your phone already has a camera which doesn't have the limitations of the pins like only having one angle being limited to 13 megapixel and only being able to take 15c 1080p videos and then to top the whole thing
off all the features every single thing that the Humane AI pin can currently do and everything that it will ever be able to do all the translation features all the AI features and the ability to ask it questions and it remember stuff all the vision things like how they demoed that you can put a Walkman in front of it and ask it what year it was made you can put a shoe in front of it and ask it who designed it your smartphone can also do all of it because fundamentally the
Humane pin is just phone Hardware with a fancy new way to interact with it to try and counter the fact that there is no physical display the one and the only advantage of it what you're essentially paying that additional $700 plus monthly subscription and having to juggle battery boosters and keep yet another device charged up for is that your Humane AI pin sits on your chest your phone does not it's just the fact that it's there now here's how it would make a lot more sense to me you're already
paying every month for a data plan on your phone right you've already paid a big chunk of upfront cash for the massive processing power on your phone so surely surely a much more useful pin would be a pin that instead of duplicating all of that but just doing it worse can connect to your phone and use what you already have I mean that's exactly how SmartWatches already work and it would mean the pin would be way cheaper its subscription cost would be minimal because you'd only need to pay
for the AI side of things and not the data again and all your stuff is in one place like when you take a photo on your PIN you can rest easy knowing that it'll appear in your phone album and it'll sync with your iCloud or whatever and it could actually be more capable because it would be able to take advantage of the greater power and the apps that most likely any flagship phone released in the last 2 to 3 years already has now I wouldn't go as far as to say that this type of product will have no use for
anyone ever and I'm quite happy to try using it in the long term to see if that changes my mind but this is just me out here telling you that I'm not hopeful unless of course Google comes in and acquires the company and then integrates them properly into Android that might be interesting
