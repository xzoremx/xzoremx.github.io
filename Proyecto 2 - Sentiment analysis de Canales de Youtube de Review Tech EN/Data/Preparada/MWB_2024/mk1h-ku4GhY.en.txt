we are about to turn this room into the most technologically advanced Next Level Cinema and gaming room that you have probably ever seen I'm literally about to get a call in 8 minutes and on that call we actually need to lock in and buy the products that we might well be using for the rest of our lives and then we will set it up and we'll experience it together for the first time I cannot tell you how excited I am so when I first walked into this room here's how I thought this was going to go I thought
oh cool the room already has such good noise isolation we're going to be able to get an awesome projector for like "£5,000 speakers will probably be another" "4,000 and then the blank screen maybe" "another, £10,000 total and it's going to" be awesome but wow have we seen some crazy stuff you can do to take it further the first of which is this is going to be a gaming room just as much as it is a cinema room so we spent the first couple of days just deciding exactly which gaming consoles we wanted
to fill it with adding in extra TVs and finding a way to hide them in the room and then realizing that we already hit our initial budget with that alone but things only started to get really crazy when we headed to a place called pulse Cinemas to find out what was possible with the audio and the projector parts of this dream Cinema room and it was super cool cuz these guys had actually built three different tiers of Cinema and each level introduced new layers of Technology but even their tier one
Cinema system which by the way started at "£30,000 had some very cool things going" on like one problem that you need to solve if you're going for a high-end Cinema is you've got a massive screen in front of you right but then where do the speakers go yeah you can put them on the sides but we very quickly realize that you're going to get the best sound if at least some of those speakers are directly in front of you and facing you so learning number one is that you can't just stick like a whiteboard on your
wall as your screen the best screens are made of woven fabric that is acoustically transparent so it doesn't interfere with the sound at all so that you can put some of your speakers behind it but there is a lot more that we've realized you can do and that we're going to try to do so that's going to diffuse the sound so it's going to reflect the sound back into the room if you just put absorption into a room it would sound like I know if you ever been to an an aoic chamber but it would just sound
horrible oh dear so yes turns out you actually don't just want absorption like we have here if you're trying to build a perfect Cinema then you have to actually balance out audio absorption reflection and diffusion to make sure that the sound is traveling in the right way around your room the only remaining thing to do then was to settle into these Uber plush reclining chairs to "actually see what this £3,000 investment"  goodness heard a string instrument so deep and that's partly because this was a
7.2.4 surround sound system you actually see these numbers thrown around quite a lot in this world so just so you know the first number means how many main speakers you have the second is the number of subwoofers you have which handle your deep bass notes most casual home Cinemas will have one but these guys went for two and then the third number is the number of ceiling speakers if any just because those can add a whole extra Dimension so with that I was so curious what on Earth could tier 2 do
"well this was a £60,000 room and as well" as the obvious projector and speaker quality upgrade the other immediately obvious thing is you can't see any of the speakers this room is showing how if you use the same acoustically transparent material as we previously had just for the screen for your walls 2 you can actually create a completely Next Level Bonker sound setup in which you see no speakers and that's so cool but also it's at this sort of what I would call very high price here that you
start to come into another conundrum so most home Cinemas will need some sort of power amplifier as the brains to process all the audio and video signals to give you the ports to connect up to audio speakers and to provide the power needed to drive them but when you get to the high end you start to realize that you're going to get better performance if you split this functionality into multiple boxes so having a completely separate box dedicated just to processing and upgrading your audio
signals and then another just for upgrading your video signals and that's what they've introduced with this setup so we tested it any carrier in the sector please respond seeing of my bones it's actually quite hard to describe to you how ridiculously impressive this second setup was like my legs were actually shaking when the bass notes hit okay so tier three o wow wo wo W now as you can probably tell I was trying to keep my call cuz you know you never want to get too
excited around people trying to sell you stuff but my God I mean this might just be the prettiest room I've ever seen full stop but then the guy introduced me to what this room is really about it's actually more to do with the Troff it's an in-house developed system to give you the ultimate base experience in what it gives you is the seat to se consistency of Base I spent about 30 full minutes trying to get to the bottom of what this trinov actually is and long story short this Cinema system which by
"the way is priced at £300,000 has four" powerful subwoofers at the front those subwoofers fire out a wave of Basse anytime there's a low note in what you're watching or playing and then the back of the cinema is lined with four more of the exact same subwoofers and this is where it gets interesting because these are called the absorbing array which basically sends out the same signal that the front is sending out but just inverted in order to cancel that sound out and then slightly delayed by
the amount of time that it takes the front sound to reach the back of the room and so trinov is basically the processor that allows super advanced stuff like that to be calculated but why well essentially to make sure that Bas doesn't reverberate it booms you feel it in your soul and then it cuts to Dead Silence again to give you the maximum possible a audio dnamic range the ability for one moment to be explosive and the next to be a whisper so we had to listen to this absolutely Bonkers tier 3 setup
and yeah I had never experienced anything like that before the sound was just bongers like it felt like a sphere around my head and the music was swimming in my brain but no obviously we didn't just see that and then buy that I mean we've spent a lot of time in showroom since we've seen screens that can actually extend to match the aspect ratio of your movie or game we've seen audio processing boxes taller than I am that actually have eyes for some reason and we've seen seating my friends
seating so so comfortable that oh my God I swear at some points I was physically unable to pay any attention to what the sales guy was telling me and so this is what I'm thinking right now we found a company called Meridian Audio who's going to do our speakers out of everything we tried they were the we're going to end up going for I can't quite believe I'm saying this but 21 speakers and 12 subwoofers and then to finish the whole thing off we managed to find not just an
acoustically transparent screen but also an acoustically transparent fabric that's going to cover every single wall so you don't see a single speaker and projector wise I initially came into this thinking I was going to get a Sony or a JBC you know the consumer facing Brands but through our travels to these various showrooms rooms we found this company called Barco and they usually deal directly with businesses so i' never heard of them but the brightness of those projectors versus the jbc's
it's actually a big difference maybe because they're designed for bigger commercial Cinemas and the seating we decided it has to be the masterminds that made this thing right here and turns out that is a company called movia who seem to have a whole load of different base designs and materials but then they're also completely modular so you can actually configure the exact arrangement of those designs so this guy's going to call in about a minute the price really adds up when you start
adding arrays of speakers hi Aon how you doing so we've had a look through the quote we're happy to go ahead with it that's brilliant that's great news even small private Cinemas that are run by film clubs and stuff like that very few of them get to this sort of level it's going to be probably one of the very best private Cinemas in this country and we're going to be playing smash on it we're going to be plugging a Nintendo switch into it yeah wow now I thought from the point of
placing that order this would be a one-month job yet again foolish ambition it actually took 4 months for a few reasons we had to tear down every single existing panel on the walls we had to fit four ceiling speakers 12 subwoofers and 17 wall speakers which to be honest the only crazier thing than hearing that number is seeing it remember every one of these speakers contains multiple speaker cones then we had to refit new panels on top in a very carefully controlled combination of super high
quality noise is ation pads with the very best sound diffusion panels we could find all painted black and then finished with our acoustically transparent black fabric going around the whole room and then finally because the team who was building it had to do a lot of testing constantly tweaking the arrangement of things using this multi-array microphone to check the results at each stage until it was just perfect and that is now inside this room is one of the greatest Cinema room and
gaming rooms ever created and I haven't even tested it yet we're about to do it together on camera and I am about to pee  excitement  welcome so I'm going to take you around the room like this and it's just going to keep building starting with the console cabinet weirdly this is one of my proudest achievements ever we started out with a plain cutout in the wall and we quickly realized two issues one that all the consoles are different heights so you had just a ton of waste space but
the bigger issue was cables we had like 30 different cables trailing all over the place because I am obsessive to an annoying level I didn't just want the consoles to be powered on I wanted to create a space where every single controller of every console is also always plugged in always fully charged and so with a bunch of carefully placed plants false walls and shelves we have actually pulled that off you basically can't see a cable so what Hardware did we go for well from left to right you
can see we've got four PlayStation five Slims there's actually a very good reason for that which I'm getting to but what I want to show you now is one of the key problems that we were trying to avoid which is what console does this controller connect to then I remembered that Sony themselves actually sell alternate colored plates and then realized that they also sell controllers that matched to the color of those plates so yeah one thing led to another and now we have four color matched ps5s
which is just surreal there's the PlayStation portal here which again does actually charge here it's like secretly connected magnetic to a very stealthy cable behind it this is a console that's had a little bit of a character Arc for me when it first released I thought wow that's a very overpriced empty piece of Hardware but as soon as you have really good stable internet and also you have a specific use case for it in mind it can be an absolute Game Changer like it is in this set this thing plays a pivotal
role in what we're trying to do here then this is a 1 tbte Xbox series X this is basically just for Halo I've been obsessed with Halo ever since I was like 10 years old and since Halo already has four player split screen on one console it'd be absolutely silly to get four Xboxes also I absolutely love these razor Chargers we've got for all the Xbox and PlayStation remotes we went through a lot of different ones ones with RGB lighting ones that tried to match the designs of the consoles
nothing beats the look The feel and the quality of these and then of course we have the Nintendo switch corner and as silly as it does feel to have this little tablet that's like a third of the power of a modern day phone Nintendo makes great games and the fact that on just one of these things you can have eight people playing multiplayer games at 60 frames per second will forever be an embarrassment to everything on that side you got to love the optimization and then in here this
has always been a dream of mine to do so for a long time we've used these knockoff Nintendo switch Pro controllers they're very customizable they're fun to look at but they're a little cheap and you can kind of tell and somehow three of the four of those controllers I use have managed to develop some form of joystick drift not this time I wanted to do everything in this house to the highest possible standard we wanted to have the best controllers with also the best customization so every single one
of these switch controllers is an official Nintendo switch Pro Controller but custom painted by colorware and I cannot believe how good it's turned out oh yeah and the final thing in this console cabinet seems really boring but is actually so cool this is an HDMI Matrix so this connects every single output device like a PlayStation an Xbox and Nintendo switch with every single input device in this room because yes there are multiple screens here so every single device in this entire room is
allocated one of these numbers and then you just tap these buttons to decide which screen those devices can display their image on now up here we've got two side cabinets so these were not here when we first got the house we got them made because there's a few extra things that we wanted to add to this room starting with the tech shelf now to most people this is probably going to look like a dumpster fire but I'm hoping given that you're watching this video you will see this for the arch piece
that it is so these two are making sure that every device has the fastest internet and the fastest data transfer like everything where possible is wired not wireless then you got a layer of plugs and this isn't fun but I think it's really important when you're building a room like this where you might be powering something that's sitting on the other side of it that you just label them so you know what's what now underneath that is something called the Blue sound node and the only reason
that we have that is just so that we can use our phones to play music through this ridiculous Meridian sound system which on one hand yes seems like a really strange thing to have to do in 2024 and the era of Sonos speakers which have that capability built inside of them already but basically you'll find when you get to really high-end sound systems everything is separate partly because they work in slightly old-fashioned ways but mostly because splitting up the functionality of each
device allows you to get devices that do each function at the absolute maximum so there's no bottlenecks and then below that we've got the lumagen and the reason we have this box in very simple terms is it makes things look better we've got so many different devices in this room all connected to the same displays you know Nintendo switch Xbox PlayStation there's an Apple TV box behind here as well the lumagen takes in all of these inputs and just make sure that when they come out of it they are
corrected in every way possible and then we've got this absolute unit of a box the trinov audio like you've seen this thing's like a super computer designed with the sole purpose of audio processing and there is something really cool that we've managed to pull off in this room thanks to the power of this box but we're getting there and then this  freezer it freezes things wow anyway I am so happy with how this thing came together so this is a PC it's designed by PC specialist specifically for
virtual reality they have this very fun and very dangerous configurator when you're picking what you want but eventually we decided on this absolutely Bonkers specification so RTX 490 graphics card 24 core Intel Core I9 up to 6 GHz Herz 8 terab of M2 Solid State Storage 64 GB of RAM and the entire thing is also water cooled just to keep it as quiet as possible and when the thing arrived that was all the stuff we expected what we didn't expect is just how handsome the thing is we originally
allocated the top half of that shelving cabinet just to store the thing we took it out the box saw how the black perfectly matched the background the wood paneling here perfectly match the sofas so we just decided it has to be here this just makes sense this is actually the first time I get to try it headset controllers oh by the way this is actually a really cool time to show you the control 4 Halo touch so technically all of these are remotes for something in this Cinema room this is
the only one we actually need every single one of these normal remotes is designed to have one purpose whereas this remote is connecting to the hardware in the house on a deeper layer and so I can do basically anything on this like for example if I click lighting here and then I go into scenes we have five different lighting modes each creating a different mood in this room but the reason I'm showing you this now is if I click this watch button here this is every single input device in
this entire Cinema room all the PlayStation 5 the Xbox series X Nintendo switch and the vrpc so all I have to do is to tap on that PC button and the PC goes through the HDMI Matrix and starts displaying on this main screen this is absolutely insane so I am streaming right now from the PC which means you're able to play VR games at a level of graphical Fidelity you would not be able to with the headset alone oh and there's like no latency at all and then for the headset it might seem like a little bit
of a strange decision why we went for The Meta Quest 3 because you know I was saying we wanted the best of the best for everything in this Cinema room and you can get a lot more fancy and a lot more expensive VR headsets than this there is a whole world of ultra specialized extremely Cutting Edge headsets but this is the one that I keep coming back to because if all you want to do is game then they are all worse than the actually quite simple meta Quest 3 mostly because of how much more
reliable the software is on this thing then you got the sofas and the reason that I fell in love with this is as far as the comfort's concerned you cannot tell this is not a normal sofa but it's actually kind of Hightech so I mentioned before that one of the main perks of this is that it's modular meaning that each one of these segments is its own piece that you can kind of chop and change to put together like pieces of Lego which means we've managed to get a sofa that perfectly fits the
space we wanted leaving just enough gap on either side it means we've been able to specifically select the feature set that we want in the armrest so I just think this is so cool if you pull this back you've got a drinks holder with an RGB configurable light on the inside and a chi charger for your phone people are always asking for Chargers when they come to your house so it's tough to describe how much joy it brings me that now I can just say to them stick your phone in the armrest but this is the
cherry on top it also means that every single one of these seats has its own three-part movable skeleton underneath so you reach your hand into this kice you can adjust the foot rest you can adjust the headrest and you can also with a different button adjust the depth of the thing and it comes out so far it is almost bed-like which is just insane considering how compact it is I'm not exaggerating when I say this thing is hideously expensive for seating but at the same time it is the best movie sofa
I've ever experienced we did end up going for the barcode projector which has a 5k resolution and you can kind of tell that it's commercial grade by the fact that it has an actual display on the side so that someone in a viewing area can actually see a preview of what's being projected out the front now this is cabinet thei this is a simple one but it's no less fun basically all of our favorite snacks and we thought that this area here would actually be really nice to pour yourself a drink in
but since we don't actually have any bottles yet it is filled with Pringles then this is a well not so many bridge and the thing that I think is particularly cool here is is how it's integrated it's quite easy for a white fridge and some cheap snacks to stand out like a sore Thum in a room like this but the way we've done the paneling and used the same acoustic fabric that we have across the entire Cinema room on this Cabinetry as well makes it feel like a part of it bean bags so these are
from whoa a company called vet saac and they're about twice as big as I was expecting them to be the box came into the house and I was thinking oh that seems a little small but cute then I opened it and the thing fraking exploded in front of me you then have to leave them out for 48 hours too fluff and here we are I knew we wanted bean bags in this house ever since we did a team retreat in an Airbnb 2 years ago and that place had swapped out every single sofa with a bean bag and it just it
changed the entire Vibe it created such a feeling of calm which I loved so the reason why we've got four ps5s here the reason why we've got an HDMI Matrix half the reason why this room exists is because of this button right here Co-op gaming and while this happens I want to explain to you why I've chosen to use surf Shar VPN for our Cinema room PC so you probably know how most vpns work oh my God it's actually working they take your traffic they root it through one of
their servers so that all the website on the other end can see is the details of that server and that's already pretty cool but surf shark uses Nexus technology meaning that every one of their servers is connected and that surf shark can bounce you between all of them on the fly without dropping your connection and that's pretty Next Level because it means you're even more difficult to track cuz you can have a new IP address every single time you click a new link and instead of your
data being massed through one server your data can be massed through an entire network of servers and you'll get even better speeds because as soon as a faster server opens up you can be rooted through that instead automatically and if you go to Sur shark.com boss you can now get it at the all-time lowest price ever $1.99 a month for an unlimited number of users with four extra months  God I can't I can't actually believe this and they're all on automatically just give me a second to
take this in so this is two LG G4 OLED TVs these things are 55 in 4K resolution the pit quality is amazing and each one is mounted to by far the most Bonkers mechanism I've ever seen in my life so this is from a company called future automation it can project the TV down a whole meter it can swivel in 360° and it communicates with control 4 which means that from this remote I can set the precise centimeter and angle that this TV is positioned at also each mechanism weighs of 200 kg so getting those into
the ceiling was actually the single hardest part of this entire project this is it this is it oh my God this is a dream I've probably had for the last 5 to 10 years and today it has finally come true I can hear bullets all around me I can see what you guys are up to in my peripheral vision every like gunshot has so much weight to it it's insane it's done nothing for our performance the skill level is incredibly low on this battlefield and you can hear it behind you yeah you can
hear everything like you actually instantly know where the enemies are oh yeah and you want to know the most Bonkers part of this whole thing because of that Trin of superc computer sitting in the cabinet the sound from each person's game can be directed towards the seat that they'll be sitting in so everyone hears a slightly different mix of audio tailored to what they're noticing on their screen while still getting the background from what's happening on everyone else and this is also where the PS portal
comes in it connects to the white PS5 for player 4 so even though there's three main screens we can still do four friends online co-op gaming in the same game at the same time just nuts and this is the pieace resistance so let's say that after gaming I want to watch something okay so you pull up Apple TV Play trailer and then there is a mode baked into here because yes we did go  H ridiculous absolutely ridiculous it happens so smoothly I can't believe it is that supposed to be scary the R
rating isn't new for me friend but it is  Disney oh my God you know the thing that's hardest to communicate through video is how the sound envelops you in the content you just feel like like all these walls they're actually speakers behind them you're being blasted from every single angle and it just pulls you in it's the best sound I've ever heard in any Cinema ever next episode is the living room which we have equally spicy plans for
