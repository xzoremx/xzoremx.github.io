I started this channel nearly 14 years ago with this camera and this phone I didn't have a clue what I was doing but all I did know is I was having the time of my life I talked about what I loved to people who actually wanted to listen to me I mean for that first video I would have been very happy with 100 views I I cannot wrap my head around how "it got 700,000 and now I still can't" believe that I'm holding this like I I remember seeing all of my favorite creators unboxing their Diamond play
buttons thinking this is the Pinnacle of human achievement and but it's not just that this has been an unbelievable chapter I I I've poured my heart and soul into this like I used to I used to use every bit of money I had to fly to every Tech event I could I used to take this little box of Mr who's the boss business cards and hand them to every person I could to try and like get my name out there this channel means so much to me a lot of sacrifices have been made but even then like I one of the lucky ones
because somehow it worked we got awarded Tech channel of the year we got a Guinness world record for the largest smartphone replica ever we overtook apple and subscribers I've been able to talk to world leaders to collab with world's biggest creators and better than all of that is I've been able to make my family's lives that little bit better it's been beyond a privilege and uh the reason I'm making this video is now it's time for chapter 2 today will be well probably the biggest single life
change moment of my life so you might know I got married this Summer yeah this guy this guy and this guy so you know if you're worried about it don't worry you'll be fine and if you watch my wedding speech you'll know that nothing has ever made me happier I met Risha 5 years ago she has transformed me and our wedding was like the greatest 72 hours of my life uh but what that means is It's Time to Say Goodbye to this house uh my family the cats and um the studio in our culture you basically
live in your family home up until you get married which means that I'm very close with my family I've been living with them for 29 years now and it also means that this room is is basically where I've built my life this used to be an attic then it became my bedroom then it became a studio and now it has like 6 billion views and we've had all manner of high-profile people sit in this chair right here but at the same time I've been here since before I even knew who I was I was doing this whole thing myself
I had practically zero self-belief and confidence and this space is is where that all turned around we've done so much living here and today I am leaving it as a functioning adult and I'm not just moving next door I've lived my whole life with my family in this fairly small city called Nottingham but it has has always been my dream to one day live in London and after about 2 years of searching we have just finally found the perfect place in London to move to and so this is both a sad occasion I'm going
to go from seeing my family every single morning when I wake up to being just under 3 hours away but also a really happy one cuz I get to live with my best friend and this house is going to allow us to plan everything just the way we want it while I am so lucky that my parents have allowed me to use practically every room at this house to film this isn't exactly an ideal place to record videos like any home it's covered with lights that flicker and noisy pipes and weird slanted ceilings
that we keep walking into but where we're moving we are going to build for the first time ever a proper Mr who's the boss Studio as part of it and so just before I officially move out I thought this is the time to tell you all the things that I never got to tell you here okay so I think it's fair to say that we have accumulated one of the strangest colle C of items over the years so I want to show you my alltime favorites let's start with you I've properly sealed it off like the the
devil itself that it is I spent "$45,000 on this this is more than I" spent on my phone this is more than I spent on my TV and this is oh dear God an incredibly realistic umbilical cord charger and it actually gets worse cuz you put your phone in  this next one is somehow even stranger so I was doing one of these rarest most expensive phone videos and caviar this luxury phone maker agreed to send me one  "$200,000 that's not the weird part so" you get inside and the first thing is
well the phone weighs an actual kilogram because it is very literally a gold brick attached to a phone pH still not the weirdest bit cuz obviously given the value of the thing the company's going to want it back right they very specifically said film the video as soon as you film the video someone would come to collect it no one came to collect it and actually it gets even stranger because then I got this this is a business card that came with the phone and it reads Jeffrey Preston Bezos owner of gold
phone number one so do you want your phone Jeffrey yes it does get crazier cuz um do you remember the Escobar phone yeah that was a whole shenanigan wasn't it well I used to keep that phone in this cabinet here until it got confiscated I got an email from the police basically saying hey there's an ongoing investigation could we borrow this before I really knew what was happening they were at the door picking it up and I never got it back and actually on a similar note I made a
video about 4 years ago on something called the U phone it was basically a phone that looked like a scam but the more I spent time digging into it the more I realized that it was actually not just one product that was the scam but like it was this enormous thing branching across the entire internet and I even managed to get the guy behind the scams name in the video but the whole chapter ended up being quite sad for me to be honest cuz I posted the video it was doing really well both from the
perspective of like people who watched it enjoyed it but also I was hoping there was going to be some justice from this I'd actually figured out who was behind this whole audal but then um his lawyers started to threaten me this was quite a while ago before I had a proper team around me and eventually I just kind of buckled under the pressure and felt like I had to delete that video otherwise I was going to like lose my channel so yeah that's the untold story of the only Mr who's the boss deleted
video apart from a couple from like 10 years ago that I deleted just cuz they were highly cringe anyway this next one is also a fun story so this is one of the only transparent TVs probably in the world we originally trying to buy it for a video futuristic Tech and we paid it never arrived or maybe it did and we just couldn't see it after a bit of back and forth xiaomi the company who actually manufactures this one reached out to tell us that they had one that we could come pick up from their Central
London flagship store so we totted off to go collect our TV expecting a boxed sealed product that they had somewhere in the back of their warehouse only to find that there was one product in store that it was bolted down in the store as the demo device and Main Attraction of this store and that no one in the store had any idea that we were about to show up to pick the thing up I genuinely think they might have thought we were trying to rob them if you were curious though very Innovative not a very useful
product and I'm being fully transparent with you the smartphone Shelf has been easily one of the craziest things we have done I mean how many times do you see this but it has also been um an enlightening experience so you might be able to tell that most of these rows actually look brand new they look as you would expect them to be the Samsung part of the Shelf looks diabolical oh no wait that one's gone that one's gone no I really like this phone that one's gone that one's gone not the Iron Man special
edition not the video I was expecting to make right but this is what we've discovered has been one of the downsides of trying to collect smartphones in a neat way and it's not exclusively Samsung like I have just noticed one over here that's a Vivo and this one's actually very upsetting cuz this was a world exclusive when I first got it there's a xiaomi over here oh that one's really bad but it is mostly Samsung's and seemingly never iPhones on the other hand though this has been kind of
amazing because like we one day dreamed we might we have actually filled basically every single row with every brand of smartphone and that is amazing and then finally we've got this little guy and I find this so cool because this is the one that made it happen in 2015 I made this tutorial video on how to turn your smartphone into a hologram and it went absolutely bananas it was the first time that I've ever truly felt speechless like I remember so distinctly posting it one
night waking up the next morning and just staring at the stats page on my laptop in disbelief like genuinely speechless imagine grinding for years and years with no real payoff and then suddenly seeing everything come together in one big moment that was what that was that was what this was and it's especially cool because that became a viral DIY project that everyone started doing over the weekend I posted it and within about 4 weeks you could actually buy kits it's like I don't own this this
is another company's kit but it was just so so wild to me that this this is the original anyways last thing before we do our goodbyes is this channel has colonized basically every room in this house and I just want to show you cuz I think it's it's kind of fun to see I mean for starters every single top down shot we've ever done so every unboxing has been filmed in my brother's old bedroom he used to sleep here and I promise I didn't drive him out with Arch videos our family's front room has
become the channel storage room so sorry m'am I have to say this room has looked absolutely terrible for the last year and a half with just mountains of boxes from videos we started with such a good system where as soon as we finished filming a video we would instantly decide whether we wanted to sell stuff or give stuff away to charity but it's just as soon as we got really busy with work that system was left by the wayside but yeah basically we spent the last couple of days
transforming it that's why there's literally no key in the log I have hidden it so they can't go inside and see what we've done but yeah I'm going to show them very shortly when they come back home and with saying our goodbyes the dining room has been invaded by our team so every time we have a team day everyone gathers around here and this is where we work and chat and decide what we're doing with the channel we have absolutely ruined it oh my God the living room has a massive
Nintendo switch TV as the centerpiece now which I'm going to be honest is probably a little too hard to change so we'll have to stay like this sorry again mom right now it's time for the thing that I've been putting off the final goodbyes do you remember this at all oh my goodness yes I do this is the very first phone I ever got it's the one Bud's got me oh and I filmed it with this camera like this so much work and so much kit has gone through this place is unreal how do
you feel now it's like coming to an end here like you I suppose yeah I am grateful oh Al that you stepping into the next stage it's been a real adventure and yeah will miss all of that but you're going to do some amazing stuff and we'll always be there as sad as it is it has been an amazing journey you've really filled it with so many wonderful wonderful memories for us thank you thank you I think I started crying first it's my fault it on me we always cry but going I miss you little I miss when
he he jumps into our bed at like 6:00 a.m. in the morning just for cuddles I'm not going to see him every day   together I've been holding on to this SE  tip oh my oh my god oh oh wow oh my gosh I know W can you remember what it even look like wow it's like brand new liim me I don't remember it being like this ever oh and this is well oh is this real  so thank you thank you for everything that you've made possible this is obviously sad like every time I look at a box it tells a different story I also
can't wait to show you what's  this off we go
