$10 toaster all the way to a $400 toaster how good can toast get at $10 very cheap and plasticky and kind of hollow oh we're done the top does look quite untouched it's a bit sad and wet three out of 10 at five times that price we have the Russell Hobs futur toaster wa it is slightly lighter in color but it is actually cooked all the way along M significantly crunchier that is a strong six at $200 then we have the KitchenAid toaster you can either have four normal slices of toast or two
massive slices of toast is it going to taste better though oh wow it's like 40 seconds M probably a seven and now at $400 this is the Bal muda steam toaster you pour water in here which the toaster then turns into steam to crisp up bread on the outside while still keeping it soft and fluffy on the inside you can so tell the bread has been looked after in there the crunch is absolutely unreal 10 out of 10
