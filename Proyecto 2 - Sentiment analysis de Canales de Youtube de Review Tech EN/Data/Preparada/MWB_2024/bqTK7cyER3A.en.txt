this perfume is created by robots which can apparently create the perfect scent for every single person the company is called every human and when you first walk into the store you cannot not see this absolute laboratory of a machine that they use to craft this stuff you pull up the company's website on your phone and you use it to answer questions about yourself it's like everything from the home City you grew up in to using sliders to assess how well you can handle certain situations the website
then creates you a code you type that code into the machine and this is where it gets caught your specific bottle gets passed along this be belt and every single syringe is surgically injecting apparently just the right amount of each individual component to craft this perfect perfume but Aaron one Aaron 2 Aaron three you invented so Aaron one oh God very fruity and also very earthy number two smells like alcohol it's been burnt number three oh it's like a gentle seab breeze which is exactly what I
tried to turn as my dream getaway location
