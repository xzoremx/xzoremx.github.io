I tested some pretty strange phone cases but this might just be the strangest case ever because this thing has a baked in color e in display on the back but why so there's an app that you install on your phone and you use that to choose any picture that you want to be sent to the back image transfer progress look at that it looks like it's having a seizure but this is just the display getting the colored ink particles in the right position so on a very basic level this means you now have two different
wallpapers you can customize you can take your own photos don't know why anyone would ever want to do this and I'm just thinking one level up from that is you could take your shopping list and import it so you can always see it on the back while you're shopping you could also use QR codes for ticketing and payments or other things but I think the most interesting part of this whole thing is the thing has no battery there's no Bluetooth there's no connection process it works completely
off a built-in NFC chip that allows it to communicate with your phone
