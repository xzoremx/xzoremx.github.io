we are about to build our dream home gym right here so we need to figure out what's the best gear we need to talk to some experts to make sure that we're making this something special and then we need to spend a lot of money actually buying the equipment setting it up and taking this bad boy for a spin so I thought what we could do is to smart with so I thought what we could do is to start with the small bits full body vibrating roller for large muscle groups well you know says large muscle groups
yeah it's like the super tech version of a foam roller what's the wave Duo Contour to the back Spine and Neck W no way the Theon Pro Plus sixth generation heat therapy hold therapy LED light therapy that's a lot of therapy recovery air jet boots I guess when I read the word jet boots I'm almost imagining flying around the neighborhood not recovering on your floor oh look there's a calf one there's an arm one there's a back and core one we could actually kit out our entire body with th body you'd
be like the worst superhero ever you'd just be very relaxed what's this Matt infrared in the infrared pimp mat hello sir how's your pimp this website is absolutely insane we should get some scales too apparently does a full scan of your body in 90 seconds even if it's approximate it's a core feature what normal product has someone not tried to turn into a smart alternative bet that this says the words AI somewhere yes Elite music boxing training machine are you kidding me I
love the idea of this it makes it feel like you're at an arcade beat driven workout punched to the Rhythm I'm interested in trying this I think it's cool I think we should try it have we done this before smart skip word oh yeah okay maybe just a normal skipping word just a just a just a real skipping as prise okay so one thing that I've been battling with in my mind is how techy do we go for the gym you can get a lot of really interesting looking Tech Gym gear I just don't know how good
it is so one of them is the Vitruvian so it's kind of like a yoga map but it's got handles that come out which allow you to lift weights and it can adjust the resistance according to how much weight you want to lift so it looks like you can squat you can bicep car you can deadlift the power to deliver up to 200 kg in one sleep package I feel like we need to get a gym expert's opinion on this cuz the tech side of me is completely sold on something like this so we are about to jump on a core with
Jeff nippard I was doing a lot of digging before this and everyone seems to regard him as the go-to guy for science back to gym knowledge hey hello what's up what you could do with a bit of help I'm looking at all this Tech Gym gear and some part of me thinking this might not actually be very good gym equipment what do you think I think it depends on what your goals are going to be is your main goal to build muscle and strength definitely muscular strength Progressive overload I have a list of
like Basics that I think you definitely want for those goals that would be a power rack so you can do squats presses pretty much any lift with a barbell you need you need a barbell and uh you need an adjustable bench so you can do like flat presses incline presses then from there you need some kind of um multi-purpose cable machine and if you've got a set of dumbbells that gives you even more versatility and then after that I would say leg curl would be my next next pick because you're going to
find that really awkward on cables honestly oh man this is really useful good thank you very much all right thank you thanks cheers bye bye bye bye so the only decision that we have left to make is machines which are actually going to make up the majority of the chin let's do tradel yeah best tradel of all time uh this peltin obviously well I don't love that I think you have to have a subscription to get the main benefit of what they're offering it feels like the industry standard for exercise machines
is calculat display and a resistive  that's a pretty treadmill I like the big screen it's definitely the nicest looking Home Gym gear I've ever seen we want to make sure that we're not sacrificing on performance for that design get a personalized consultation should probably just call them so off we headed to techno jy's London showroom to see for ourselves how techno gy the world's greatest frag the diffusers coming out the walls technogym for men right first off the treadmill which was
actually really impressive from a tech standpoint but I did have one concern could this damage your joints over time generally running my Tre is quite for you and running outside he explained that if we wanted to minimize the impact to our joints which I certainly do then we'd actually be better off going for a machine with slats so we moved over to the Techno gym run which was actually the more affordable machine since it wasn't part of techno jy's fancy designer line of products but to me this
actually felt way higher performance the thing was basically silent to run on thanks to these thick shock absorbing rubber slabs which is also what makes them better for your joints also with this machine you just place your phone on top and an NFC tag inside of it allows you to log directly into both your techno gym account so that you can track your workout details also all of your own personal apps like Netflix the thing that also really impressed me though it was this is a machine for
running yes but they've also managed to turn it into a strength training Machine by being able to simulate the sled push so if I start pushing and then if I stop pushing and then if I st pushing yeah exactly yeah that is fascinating you can very easily decide a few things you want to do and see how you get better at them the amount of settings and features on this one machine genuinely blew me away I decided in this moment that we have to find a way to fit one of these in too but we also knew
that we wanted to get an elliptical as our second cardio machine cuz that's what I currently use every day then techno Jim introduced us to a new kind of elliptical called the artist vario it's like a normal elliptical but instead of your movements following a fixed path you can control where your legs go you kind of have to find a rhythm but when you do this thing is amazing cuz it's an elliptical and then when you want it to be it's also a step machine it is absolutely insane how
indepth the software is it's got video visualization that's pretty useful actually I think it works but then the guy took us to what I would consider techno jy's hero products it's a line of machines called bio strength where each one focuses on one muscle group but takes that to the absolute limit one thing you'll probably notice immediately is there's no weight stack machine you are right the bio strength machines are actually using magnetic resistance for the weights which is really cool because
it means no clanging metal whenever you drop your weights but also that you can control that weight electronically and select exactly how many kilos you want to lift not just go up in fives or 10 so we can change the resistance level here  that just went oh god wow cuz you also can't take a break here wow that keeps you accountable yeah now cool as that was we decided we probably didn't have enough space to start getting one machine for every single muscle group so we decided to
just focus on the leg machine since that's what Jeff recommended we go for if we were to only pick one this is 35 kilos but then if you push it harder it will give you way more resistance oh yeah of oh I see it I don't know how much I buy into it but there is also an AI built into these bio strength machines that they call Coach at least in this bio strength range the equipment is way higher Tech than I expected like I've used tons of techno gym in commercial gyms and I guess they
either tend to go for lower end stuff or they're going for stuff that's just older and more functional we can have a word of them about these bezels though so that's bio strength but for some things like your bench you also just kind of want to keep it low Tech it's the most comfortable gym bench I've ever sat on this feels absolutely insanely comfy for a bench like you could like sit there reading a book on that thing we also do need some storage for this room and this was pretty good inso cuz
the height of the rack means it can fit a lot of stuff in without taking up the much more valuable width of the room so dream equipment selected now it's time to put everything in its place and this was actually quite incredible to see because these guys have software that takes your floor plan inserts each of the products you picked including exactly how much space each one takes up so we use this kind of like puzzle pieces to work out how everything fits then it gets better because to make sure
that it all aesthetically lines up their software can also generate full 3d renders of what those machines would look like within your exact space which is pretty cool tech for a gym company I got to say and then after this we just had to find the perfect flooring wait for our goodies to arrive and then top it all off by creating Smart Systems that make this as slick and automated as possible and now the ultimate smart home gym is finally ready this right here is the single single most important room of
the entire house for me cuz you might have seen about 3 years ago my fitness hit an all-time low and with it so did my confidence and my mood it had a really bad effect on me and so the entire goal of this dream gym is to   in so we have actually spent the last 3 months optimizing tuning and then reoptimizing this room to the point where for us this is now Perfection thanks to five things five decisions we've made that each take this gym up to a whole new level so level one is all
about how do we eliminate friction how do we make this as easy as possible to one to come and crucially to stay until we're done so did you notice something as I first walked through that door I didn't need to turn on anything and that's because our first step to achieving this pure frictionless is a motion sensor which as soon as someone walks through the door will activate the lights will turn on the TV and it will set the air conditioning to a cool 18° C is this strictly necessary no of course
not but does this make it ever so slightly easier to just drift into this room and start a workout when you have 10 spare minutes yes and that's the goal and now that we are in the room how do we make sure we stay well one thing we noticed quite early was one of the main reasons that one of us would end up leaving the gym early was we were thirsty and we'd forgotten to bring a drink down with us so in the event that that happens having this mini fridge here eliminates that excuse with the
added benefit of you're going to perform better in the gym if you're really well hydrated the second thing though that makes people want to leave this room is if their phones run out of battery obviously the idea is not that you come to this room to sit on your phone but if it does run out then you are going to need to leave to go charge it just in case someone needs to reach you so it's helpful to have a charger in here now we do actually have wireless charging baked into some of these technogen machines
but frankly it's prettyy similar to the state of incar wireless charging it's slow and it only works about half the time so we have ended up buying two cryoboost Chargers from ESR and this is such an elegant solution cuz it means the first thing that I do when I walk into this room is I stick my phone on here while I'm taking out my gym gloves and it's charging it keeps my phone away from me so I'm not checking it between every single lift which makes gym time far more productive and it serves as the
perfect Little Gym clock the actually looks nice unlike every single proper gym clock that we've seen also yes these guys have sponsored past videos they're not sponsoring this one I just think they're great and it means that before we are even five steps into this gym we are ready to gym there's one final cherry on top for this level so put my Wrist on here connect and we are in so I use an Apple Watch for my health Tracking not because I think it has like medical grade accuracy or anything it
just makes it really really fun it makes me want to compete with my friends and to do better than them and so it is so cool to me that I don't need my phone I don't need to manually type anything in I just tap this watch on one of these machines and because this is all Apple gym kit compatible the watch tells the machine all of my details so my height my weight Etc and then the machine tells the watch all of the workout details like Pace like incline which means that both machines work together to give you
the most accurate most instant workout tracking I have ever had which because it's happening through the Apple watch is all automatically logged directly onto the friend leaderboards that I'm trying to climb to the top off I just love it so now that we've successfully got ourselves to use the gym level two is how do we maximize space in the gym and there's two parts of this both of which I think could be really useful for any home gym design so number one is building vertically with every single
thing that we've put into this gym the key resource that I've been trying to preserve is floor space the more more vertical space we use the more floor space we get to keep and so the more features we can get in here and the more open it's going to feel that's why we've gone for completely vertical racks for our dumbbells that's why instead of a punching bag I really like the idea of a flat punching wall not the only reason though this is a very unique Gadget I'm getting there and that's why instead of
placing a bunch of plants around the room on the floor for freshness we've gone for a wallmounted moss feature this is from the same company who made the one in our office by the way and for those of you who are asking yes yes it's real no it's not still alive it's dead and they preserve it with the spray oh and it's also why we created a custom Cabinet around this mini fridge just so that we could build you're probably starting to understand what makes me happy at this point a charging station
for all the smaller gym gadgets vertically above it which means that all of this stuff has a place and all of this stuff is always fully charged but then the second part of this whole Space maximization equation is making sure that the tallest parts of your machines are closest to the walls now you might not always be able to do this but if you can it'll mean that even though there might not be physically more space for your feet it will still psychologically feel like there is more space because
you're not seeing as many visual obstructions from up here but level three is where we get to the meat of this gym so we bought our dumbbells from a company called blackbox I just really like how No Nonsense their design is and then all of these adjustable weights are from a company called Boflex and honestly I think this thing right here is an absolutely amazing product like if you think about this compared to these two towering dumbbell racks this takes up a quarter of the space while actually
being able to go heavier these things go up to 41 kilos each compared to just 30 I think their adjustable cattle Bell is also very good for the same reason and then the barbell is I imagine for a lot of people the single most useful form factor because it actually saves you a ton of Time Versus having to come over here take this off load weights onto this bar put this back on secure it in place it's just that I don't think this one is quite as good a product as the other two I just find the weight loading
mechanism a little bit fiddly it's really easy to miss the exact spot that you have to put it back into to be able to change the weight but the key thing that I think we have got right in this room is the machines you've already seen which ones we ended up going for but this is where I get to show you what actually makes them special first things first the Vitruvian and if you actually stop and think about what this thing is claiming to be it sounds Bonkers they are pitching this thing as an entire gym
for people who don't have an entire gym but the more surprising part of this is that I actually think it's closer to that objective than you think to get the downside out of the way while it does save you space it doesn't save you cost "this is a $3,000 slab and if you want" the full feature set it is another $40 per month and if you stop paying that $40 you lose access to your workout history but then on the other hand if you really think about this it's kind of a miracle I mean this as a piece of
Hardware is like barely thicker than a chunky yoga mat it does weigh 30 kg but then with that 30 kg it actually allows you to lift any weight you want up to 200 kg thanks to Magnetic resistance on the inside this one machine does actually give you the capability of this entire weights rack and more not to mention software that does a pretty good job at gamifying the whole thing and it's also just really well put together there's so much smart Gym gear that when you get it it just feels cheap and
creaky and plasticky this is not that so we probably won't keep this cuz you know we're lucky enough to actually have the equipment that this is designed to simulate but if you don't and you're willing to put up with the cost of this I think it's a really good product then we've got the centerpieces all of these technogy machines and again key cavat out the way first given how expensive these things are you would expect them to be able to go heavier by default like for the Dual adjustable pulley machine
they only ship this by default with 35 kilos on either side 35 kilos is not a lot of weight and you have to pay extra to get 50 or for the SWAT rack what you see here is the total weights that this thing shipped with which is not enough to do any kind of serious lifting so we've ordered more right so that said these are the best exercise machines I have ever interacted with and not even because you can actually play Angry Birds on your treadmill thanks to them running an Android based layer it's
partly the fact that they've thought about the little things that a lot of gym companies tend to overlook things like how every pulley mechanism feels completely frictionless how the benches are so intive you literally lift it to lift it there's no pull out this pin look for the hole try and line it up and get it back in and if you want to lower  it not to mention the upper layer is actual memory foam I love how the machines have built-in storage for all the extras so they're not strewn around
on the floor how most of the surfaces are padded so that there's very little in the way of metal clanging against metal and how everything that needs to be adjusted can be adjusted with one hand but the other thing that I've been so impressed by that I did not expect to be impressed by is the fusion of the hardware and the software so let's say I jump onto this elliptical and I want to join a class it's very immediately obvious that these classes are specifically built for people using this
exact piece of Hardware you can see your coach using the same exact machine they'll even point to things that you can interact with on your screen cuz for example you can do every single session in three levels of difficulty with the further ability to tune it to your exact level and then like I originally thought all of these outdoor exploration things were really silly but when you click on one you're not just watching a video taken on someone's phone that has zero relation to the effort that you're
putting in it is actually all synced up so I can see how far in kilometers I've got left to go I can see stats of the Walk Like incline and elevation and the Machine will actually adjust itself to factor in what is happening on screen it's not going to replace actually going Outdoors but one day doing a street side tour in Italy one day climbing Mount Etna it does add a bit of that much needed variety into what can otherwise become quite a stale form of exercise and you can even do crazy stuff like
yesterday I went on a real life run yes outside of the house so on this machine I can pull up that run and race against myself this will pull up the exact route I did and I can try and compete against my past self knowing that this is also factoring in all the hills and troughs of that run and adjusting its own elevation to match but my absolute favorite thing about these machines is the sheer number of stats these things record and log everything from heart rate that's tracked automatically
through the handles to run power to step length and since the easiest way to progress in the gym is basically just to try and do a little bit more than you did last time I've never been able to see that progression as clearly as I can now and that is a pretty good segue onto level four so level four is what takes this gym from a gym that's easy to come to to a gym that you want to keep coming back to how do we build in accountability and this iPad is an important part of that so on this iPad
is every single thing that we need to use while we're in the gym and nothing more than that that's by Design so all the music for example in the gym is controlled on here but more importantly so is all the workout tracking I actually use the AR AI baked into the Opera browser to find this app and I may have also lost a bet with my team which means I have to do this entire thing while doing press UPS so what's the best rated app on iPad for tracking my workouts okay just about there's one called
Center Nike Training Club Apple Fitness Plus so this one that it's label here heavy is the app that I've ended up using partly because it has quite a wide library of exercises so when you're setting up your workouts it already knows what you're trying to do but mostly honestly just because I love the user interface and it's really good at showing you your progress but then also I can just ask Arya okay I want to make my biceps look bigger build me my Perfect workout plan
and enter and it can literally make the entire thing end to endend from which exercises to how many reps to top tips to making sure that you achieve your goals not to even mention that Opera now has the slickest integration of split screen the way the Opera lets you just drag a tab to one side to open it next to your existing tab is so seamless and they have about a million ways to customize the thing to look just the way you want with these new themes link below to download the Opera browser for 
oh now the second part of making sure we keep ourselves accountable is this board so this is a habit tracker you can use these for basically anything but the way that we've set this up is every time we do a full workout we just slap a sticker on here on the way out of the room it seems really simple but for us it's a really nice way of without needing to take out your phone or open up an app to see when you've been slacking but also when you've outdone yourself and that
feels really good but I've been saving the best till last the single best thing that you can do for your gym once all the fundamentals are solid is to make it fun so this is nightclub mode and it is it's cooler than I ever thought a gym could be in most rooms of this house we put two Meridian speakers in the ceiling in this room two four six of them as well as a dedicated subwoofer so you actually feel the base we added a 10 m Phillips hue light script going all the way around the Moss wall on this side
and then five 3 m phip few light strips in between the wooden paneling here mostly because it sinks to the music oh yeah and we painted this last time you saw this paneling it was just plain natural wood but as soon as we realized that we wanted to have this dark mode nightclub option it became pretty clear that we needed to spray paint the whole thing but the single coolest part of this entire gym is that the dancing of the lights on the walls which syncs to these speakers that are playing out the
ceiling also sinks to the boxing wall now I will say this is it's not the most polished product I've ever used you have to put up with an app that's how do I put this not particularly premium and quite clearly just Google translated over from a Chinese version and not particularly well but to be fair the core functionality does work quite well and if you haven't done a lot of boxing before the calories burned per minute is something else I actually can't fathom how people can get into a ring and stay
at it for over 30 minutes especially when their opponent actually punes them back so that is the dream gym and I we'll catch you in the next one
