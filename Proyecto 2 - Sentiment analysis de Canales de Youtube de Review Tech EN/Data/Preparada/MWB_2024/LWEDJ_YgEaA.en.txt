so we are about to turn this into our Dream kitchen we're going to find the absolute greatest appliances machines and gadgets we're going to buy them we're going to fit them and then we're going to test them to find out if we've made a big mistake so quite a few of the big things already done we've got the hob we got the oven we got the tap so what do we need I guess we still need a toaster so you might have seen I'm semi obsessed with this Japanese brand called balmudo yeah it's literally like the
first thing you make anyone experience when they come into the house but I thought if we're going for the most high-tech kitchen is there a more high-tech one and then I found this one revolution Pro why didn't you just screaming on a toaster tap your toastiness level 1 to 7 and watch it toast in half the time so this is actually an interesting dilemma it's either we go for the slow methodical balmuda experience or the really really fast toaster I think we need to test the
balmuda against this that's a fantastic idea winner stays yeah I'm actually curious like what's uh Tik Tok saying about kitchens with the ninja creamy you'll never buy ice cream again because it turns just about anything into ice cream frees your ingredients and it does the rest it's just asking to be tested let's try it they also do a slushy machine which is either a complete waste of space or a dream kitchen gadget I can't actually tell we also need a microwave the microwave is no longer
your kitchen's greatest I saw and then it shows us this interesting that's a TR sh this "one's actually okay in know 1,000 W" microwave but then it does 1100 W powerful steaming we need a blender smart blend technology I me they just added the word smart to what it is 100 speed touch slider 100 speeds is a lot of speeds and a Sleek show stopping design I can't imagine many people are going to be stopping looking at this looks like the best one Â£849 for a blender so one other the
things someone really recommended we try Sonic ice so it's made with flaked ice compacted into cylindrical nuggets and is love for its soft Airy texture that makes it more pleasant to chew what kind of psychopath chew their ice wo glacial Pro so this is what it looks like we already tiny in Pebble West wa yeah super fast ice nuggets in 4 minutes wow I have bought a lot of Gadgets in my time but hits different when you're buying it for yourself another thing we don't have is a bin yeah I mean the
mounting bags of trash in the corner reinforced our statement so what about the one you have outside your studio right now yeah it's a really good bin to be honest it's got a little sensor and anytime you wave over it it opens straight away and it's really quiet as well I wonder if there's something else this is a pretty cool site yeah simple human really nice actually it's very much the vibe of this house this is interesting is that what I think it that's like a paper towel Hub and you
take out the middle and that's a spray bottle that's minimalism sensor pump for your soap yeah that that does make a lot of sense doesn't it so you can control how much you get based on where your hand is put your hand up close to a small da or further away from wall feel like it's going to be a little bit of a learning curve there like a couple of times at the start you got to put your hand here be entire canister I think it's just a standard dish R I really like it it's clean oh yeah I just remembered
Robot vacuum cleaner one of the big reasons why we actually bought this house is is because every single floor is just concrete floors with no seams between the rooms so one Robot vacuum cleaner will cover the entire floor and this has to be the one so now that we got all the basics it's time for the weird and wonderful so doing the other things then are dining table dining chairs B and we had a very productive time at the furniture shop finding all of them oh ah this one looks
padded like it o this is the moment we realized swivel was an absolute must for us even for a dining chair oh oh my God yeah that's incredible I feel like we found something in this that we did not know we wanted like the idea of this rotating dining chair anytime someone talks on a table you're looking at them now in order to have a swiveling dining chair we also needed to make sure that we found table legs that were high enough so the chairs don't get stuck and tucked away enough that your legs aren't
banging into them as you move around o i quite like the angular ones plus we also found our Dream table top to go with it hey what the I love the feel of it I love how thin it is the legs don't interfere for me it's made by a company called reflex and what I found absolutely fascinating about it is that it looks like marble but it's actually tempered glass thanks to a printing technique that they've developed and that has two major benefits they can make it way thinner and they can add
this frosted matte finish which seemingly makes it pick up zero fingerprints do you mind if we grab one of those moving chairs this could be the  combination are we getting it yeah we're getting full rotation look at that so that's our table our base and all dining chairs locked in but there is scope to add swivel to one more product this is far beyond what I expected from a bar stool I've used bar stools before but they do not have the cushioning of this the stitching of this the piping of this
and it's when you sit on it it just ah I don't think we're going to get better than this what do you think yeah okay let's do it now this was surprisingly the most fun room to put together so far cuz this is where it really dawned on us that this is going to be our kitchen that we cook every meal in every day that for the first time we could optimize every single micro aspect of it perfectly for us everything down to the theme we wanted to create the perfect little reading look the programming of the
lights to be able to create the exact scenes we wanted and so I am buzzing to show you the final product welcome to the dream kitchen today we find out what is the absolute best kitchen Tech in the world through a combination of things that we've already tested very thoroughly and things that we're about to test together now starting with this I've seen people raving about this ninja slushy machine probably once a week for the last 8 weeks on social media but then equally that's never stopped us eventually
finding that something is still a stupid idea so we got one we set it up and the idea is that you can put anything in here so long as it's got some sugar in it so I'm actually going to say something Rogue here but Red Bull is probably my favorite tasting drink ever so can this preserve that flavor while actually making the texture even better be so cool if it's also able to keep its Fizz although judging by the amount of effervescence in here I'm guessing it won't whoa okay this is really exciting
but now right next to that is the Nugget edible ice machine that we bought earlier the way that we planned this kitchen out is this is one of LG's signature wine buets we got it with the house but you know there's only so much wine two people can drink so it's actually also kind of the perfect place to store everything you'd need for a cocktail or a mocktail so then that makes this the ideal place to store the two gadgets related two drinks but there's a dilemma with this one because
when we first bought the house and we were deciding what gadgets to get for it we didn't have a fridge here but then in the process of trying to find the best fridge we ended up with this the LG instav view the key thing for me just being that it's very space efficient you can store stuff right up until the edges I do find it really funny though that their entire marketing and product name centers around how you can knock to see what's inside this one section like gee I wish there was a fast way of seeing
what's inside a fridge but my point was that this like many fridges nowadays has an ice machine baked in this is clearly the easier option it has a filter on the inside and even disinfects its nozzle each day with ultraviolet light so is nugget ice from this machine here so good that it's worth buying and keeping around this extra pretty bulky machine okay so water goes in the top here so apparently if I just click quick start it's going to start Ching out ice in 4 minutes which needs to be tested
and so what it's doing right now is freezing but also combining that frozen water with air to create a lighter more textured Ice Cube something's just dropped into here but we are 5 minutes 30 in so feeling a little misled oh it kind of looks like the thing ate too much Indian food last night been 19 minutes and we now have a sizable portion of nugget ice that was Dreadful and they normal fridge ice okay aesthetically I actually don't think that looks any better okay so you add
water to normal ice then water to the Sonic ice it practically disappears on the inside it's just not appetizing is it it kind of looks like I've stuck a load of cotton wool inside my glass now  ingest doesn't stop you getting brain freeze that's for sure it just tastes like crushed ice not impressed does that mean I have to chew this there is a difference but there's only a difference if you decide that you're going to eat your ice at which point if this is a 9.5 out of 10 on the
Pain Scale then this is still an eight all right well this was actually a fairly easy decision you get a three out of 10 on the bright side though this looks completely transformed like not in the slightest bit like Red Bull anymore which is both very exciting and concerning this is a pretty big moment whoa why does everything look like it's taking a dump today that's actually pretty slick I have to say so one thing I can tell it's only been sitting here for 30 seconds but the liquid has
separated to the bottom mhm oh my God yeah that's the stuff it looks like just really dry ice with all the liquid at the bottom but this is actually melt in your mouth perfectly shaped deliciousness and whether this is because it was originally a fizzy drink or not it tastes fizzy it's that kind of micro I texture fair play deserves the hype that is a 9.5 out of 10 now onto the other side I don't think we quite appreciated when we first got the house how crazy useful it is that it's been
pre-fitted with two identical self-drying dishwashers right next to each other so originally we bought a dish rack to keep up here but actually having two of these means that we don't even need that because there's always one dishwasher that's ready to load used dishes into and one that makes sure that we've always got clean stuff ready and then for the few things that are just too big for the dishwashers you just hand wash them and you put them on this which we got from Joseph Joseph and it's
such a clean little drying system but cabinet 2 is the breakfast area we decided that it's the most efficient route to get bread from the fridge put it into your toaster and then work your way straight to the dining table but which toaster I think this is going to be such an interesting battle because these are both basically the most expensive toasters you can get but they both do this toasting in completely opposite ways so let's solve this once and for all which is the best Toaster in
the world so the Bal Mudder is the way simpler machine you put your bread in you turn it on you set a timer and you let it cook with the one twist being that you can also fill it up with water which coats the bread in a fine mist and then because water heats up faster than air it makes the outside crispy in the inside fluffy the revolution Pro is well it's definitely the more customizable toaster so there's like 20 30 different types of bread you can pick which ones show up and what order they're in you
pick whether you're starting from fresh or frozen and then even what toastiness level you like oh my God the image actually changes depending on what you select so you can preview what your toast is going to look like not to mention you can do paninis with this accessory and even becomes a warming rack using this one okay let's set it to a perfect free there we go 3 2 one go a oh that is so slick now I got to say between the two the balmuda looks prettier and also we've only used this
revolution like twice and the entire finish is covered in fingerprints it's just really hard to keep clean but then Counterpoint it does also have a removable crumb tray and is even smart enough to tell you when it's full so you know when to remove it whereas the bow mood is probably going to be a little higher maintenance wait what think 5  me wow that said while I am a great appreciator of speed that doesn't look anything alike like if you're going to go as far as to
program what every stage of bread should look like shouldn't you first prioritizing making sure you can actually make the bread look like that okay so that took nearly three times as long but tell me that is not a more professional looking piece of toast I'm not exaggerating when I say I think the Bal muda's toast looks vastly more appetizing let's bust them up it's the  this is a pretty average slice of toast it's got a little bit of crisp on the outside but it's also quite doughy
inoffensive but forgettable oh got to make sure I eat an equal amount of this  fair every time I compare the Bal muda to something else I have the exact same reaction it's just better every time I take a slice of toast out of that baluda my first impression is is damn that's really hard but it's designed that way so that when you add a little bit of butter it softens it to the point where it is perfect whereas that butter normally makes every other piece of toast a little too soft okay so there's
two slices of toast in front of you can you taste them one by one and tell me which one you think is better they're very different  colors oh I don't know oh you're getting thre a lot of bread to make this decision this is a better done toast this is this kind of feels like  skaing yeah off we go you toast mate cabinet 3 is the lunch/dinner area hence the microwave which has actually been really good for us but it's a microwave we don't need to dwell on that got to say though one of the coolest things
about this kitchen is that it not just has these hidden cabinets that you can make disappear when you close the doors but also that every single one of these cabinets has four main sockets so that we can keep every single appliance that we want to use permanently plugged in ready to go without clutching the main island which as you can see brings me great joy oh yeah in terms of the smaller bits in this kitchen by the way so we bought our dining equipment from a company called fabal and it's been
amazing nothing has any seams for things to get stuck in everything cleans in one swipe it's completely scratchproof and it's fine in the dishwasher we also got our glasses from the same Fable company because know me you know I cannot resist bezeless things and these are probably the thinnest glasses I've ever used while being a lot stronger than they look it's also just a really efficient form factor because you're not carrying any extra weight and your liquid literally starts from the very bottom
cookware wise we settled on carway in the end these things are like nonstick to another level they look beautiful and you can also tell that this is a company who thinks about the little things like for example how they ship them with the magnetic holders that you need to store them this thing has been an absolute GameChanger it's a strainer that keeps your pasta or rice completely upright so that you can just pour away the water and then let it sit without leaking and
then these are the man Kitchen Salt and Pepper cannons which to my disappointment don't actually launch your pepper across the room but the level of control you get here is insane most normal meals can grind between 12 to 28 mesh size this can do 8 to 60 okay so that's drinks that's breakfast that's lunch and dinner all done well now it's time for my favorite automation candl light mode so let's do it it makes the blinds come down it turns off all the room lights except the one right over
the dining table and it makes all of the Phillips Hues that we've hidden around the room go to this lovely warm orange color so cool and that feels like a pretty good leading to dessert so this is the Ninja creamy it is their ice cream machine and even though this one isn't as viral as the slushy machine my prediction is that this is going to be the underdog so here's my problem every night like the moment I finish eating dinner my body switches modes and suddenly just starts craving dessert and
so the thing that I'm most curious about is if I put into this just the standard ingredients that I use to make a fairly healthy chocolate protein shake so this is just chocolate protein powder and milk can this turn that into an actually tasty ice cream so you start by ejecting canister and then you place in your prefrozen ingredients so in a sense there is a little bit of prep cuz you  before this is actually just w most expensive ASMR machine I feel like I want some crunch in here oh
oats pretty healthy serving of that so you get three options over here and then ice cream oh my God it's going to take 2 minutes is that [Applause] it now as you can probably tell this is not the cleanest video we've ever filmed but the reason that my face looks this unbothered is because of what we have here so we specifically asked robor Rock if they were willing to sponsor this video because their Q Revo slim is the smartest robot cleaner I have ever used like the navigation on this thing is
bordering on self-driving car levels it's absolutely surrounded in 3D sensors that are all upgraded and all work together to form what they call the starsight autonomous system and that means that this robot deeply understands your room for example with any other Robot vacuum cleaner before letting them go you have to first pick up any obstacles you know a clump of cables or some shoes you left around this robot is so so aware that it will not just avoid those obstacles wow but it will identify them
it can recognize 73 different floor objects and it will mark them on the virtual map that it builds of your room so you know what it avoided and it knows that those objects are temporary so they won't affect its understanding of a room unlike something more permanent like a dining table would it gets better though because it's incredibly thin and the mop and the side brush are extendable now so it can fit under pretty much anything and it can can also clean right up until
the very Corners so long story short we have set up one of these on every floor of the house they send themselves out to clean while we're asleep they head back to the dock on their own when they're done cleaning they empty their own dust bin they power wash their own mop we don't really do anything anymore so link below to check it out and now final few finishing touches that take this from a great kitchen into a dream kitchen so the first is simple human so I have used
a couple of products from this simple human company in the past but it's actually getting more of them setting them up properly in our own space that has given me a whole new appreciation for this company so here's how I would describe these products they're not cheap they strongly incentivize you to lock yourself into the simple human ecosystem but while do they make your life easier if you're willing to put up with that so for example this simple human bin from the very first
interaction it's thoughtless you just walk up to it and a sensor in front of it will make it open there's a pod up here perfect example of something they want you to keep buying from them but something that's also very effective at making your trash just smell like 90% fresh Citrus basically oh and by the way for the remaining 10% we got the Bri 2 Pro air filter which is pound-for-pound not the best air filter you can get and the app is pretty unreliable but then when you factor in how much it suits the
aesthetic of the room and how it also acts as the scent diffuser using essential oils I think it's worth it so then let's say your trash is full they've made every part of the process easy you pull out these pretty rip proof bags you pull the tags to fasten those bags and then to put a new bag in you don't need to go go rummage around under your sink you just reach inside you grab said new bag and these simple human bags even let you know when you're running low with a QR code that lets you order
new ones to arrive just in time before they actually run out from you guessed it simplehuman.com see what I mean about the ecosystem now I'd actually go as far as to say that their paper towel holder though is even better so the paper towel goes on the outside feet Regina Blitz if you know you know it's held in place by this arm so it doesn't actually matter how much you've got left and this bottle that sits on the inside it works even better than I expected it to what an
insanely intelligent solution to bundle together two products that often need to go together anyway but then equally they will try and sell you on their surface cleaning tablets too which you mix with water to form the solution that goes in here but you can just fill it up with anything but my number one favorite product from these guys has actually ended up being these sensor pumps I was initially worried about buying another Gadget that needs to be charged and also filled up with soap every now and again
but we've had like 2 months of heavy usage and we haven't had to do either and it saves so much hassle while cleaning to just be able to wash your dishes with this and wash your hands like this and then of course take off the lid and this is how you order your refills so on brand right it looks like my protein shake has been creamed what did he say now we did have to run this a few times because I think at the beginning the mixture was so rock solid that the blades inside of this
couldn't actually cut through wow look at this that Scoops up so nicely there's a little bit of roughness to it I'm hoping  icy oh yeah this is actually a game changer I could actually steal myself every night going forward pre- making myself one of these and having a post dinner but actually guilt-free treat it's also not crazy messy like all we have to clean afterwards is one two this video was actually just an excuse to eat you know when I first saw this creamy machine and the slushy machine online
the very first thing that popped into my mind was surely that's pointless cuz you see so many gadgets like this like that bartisan that I reviewed a while back where all the work is actually being done by the capsules or the preparation you have to do beforehand and the Machine is just a glorified mixer but that's not the case with either of these the end product would be almost impossible to achieve otherwise oh I think this is a 10 and then the final thing is just we
got really lucky with this kitchen it's designed for 10 people to be able to prep food at the same time without bumping into each other it's got one surface that we have to keep clean there's no walls that you can backsplash onto there's no handles on anything that you can get caught in your clothing and so knowing that we had such a good base the biggest thing on our mind was just how do we build the things we want into this without interfering with it like we wanted plants so we've put those quite
far back we wanted smart Philips Hue lighting and so we found ways of weaving that into this main island without adding obstru instuctions we got the Samsung frame TV as well here to add to the earthy green fresh theme that we've been trying to create but the box that you need to control the thing we put it inside the wall so that you can't see a thing and that makes this for us the dream kitchen Beyond a dream really this is just wow really so I will catch you in the Next Room hint I will be heavily
relying on that one especially over Christmas time
