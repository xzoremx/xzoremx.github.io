we are about to build our Dream living room we're going to spend the next 5 minutes finding the most cozy Furniture slick decor and high-tech gadgets we possibly can and then we're going to fuse them all together into a place where you can just chillax to the max so let's start with all the tech to be honest we don't even need to shop for this I think we know what TV we're getting yeah it's got to be the frame frame TV every time I see it I never realize it's actually a TV until someone
turns it on it does look shockingly like a real piece of art and you can change it you can have art you can have photos okay let's pull the trigger expensive start okay so speakers we could do ceiling speakers we could do like a sound bar across the bottom do you know what I think I think because this is like the room where you're going to want to just recline and get blasted by what's a cool thing to listen to I I just feel like this this is a really cool room to have like big floorstanding
high-fi speakers bank and olison I'm curious what they would do man I normally feel like bang an olivon gets it right but that it's the culmination of B's wildest dreams nightmares you got kef they also make really really good speakers oh yeah so Meridian the same company who's doing the audio in our Cinema room they also have floor standing speakers let me just get the Meridian Meridian natural nut and Seed Butters I've actually had those they're really good oh already audio okay so you
can go gloss black satin white honestly like these figures are so so expensive but this has been like one of my dream things to O for a really long time so right after we filmed this spying section we actually went to go check out this Meridian floor Stander in person and I fell in love not even just with the sound but the engineering like you see this separate head that you have for your higher notes this thing is so isolated from the main body that I was able to balance a coin sideways while
the thing was still blasting at full volume so we got them okay lighting so we've tried quite a few different Lighting systems in our old house we've tried goie Nano Leaf um lifx the best one in my experience has always has been Phillips okay so Phillips H they're definitely very expensive for what they are every time you see one of their bulbs you just think my God like $40 what is it made of yeah what is it made of exactly think we want a couple of like maybe in the corner here oh in the
corners of the room just kind of bleeding onto the wall oh that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's interesting there it is and it's got wood and it's got and it's got a wooden base and it's got a high Hefty price wow such a good match for the room that it would be rude not to yeah I agree so table lights there's actually quite a  options what are we doing I don't know let's get some irises light strips do we want any light strips underneath the sofas under the sofa I think makes a lot
of sense give it that kind of floating feel the only Annoying Thing about Phillips is you then also have to buy a separate Hue Bridge it's a necessary evil I think that's all the lighting we need what else do we need in this room I was thinking some kind of really nice scent diffuser so I found them called the hotel collection wa our Tower scent diffuser uses Cutting Edge cold air diffusion technology it's called Mist so each of these oil refills is inspired by the scents in different famous hotels
Star Wars The Empire so it's high-end hotels or smell like Star Wars or on Earth you can choose to smell like deed ey or Sith can you imagine in the movie they pull out their lights him as they're like what are you weing I think we should get the dark side it's also buy one get one 80% off so I feel like that makes a lot of sense okay let's do it what else do we need in this room what are you thinking like what is this room this room's kind of like a happy place isn't it you know board games
books Pokémon well we've been looking for a place to C all of the stuff we have we have the Pokémon binders the cards the plushies should I bring the I don't know what you're talking about a few moments later we have the plushies oh the these are adorable let's get Pokémon into this room I'm actually on board I think we could do it in a really nice subtle way or not subtle imagine if we had like a cabinet spanning that entire wall and it's just filled with just things that we find fun
like Pokémon if you would like to look for some Pokémon stuff I'm okay with that oh Pokémon Center that's what I'm going to find you doing I really like we lord it's really cool Pokémon I'm on board I'm going to call your Blu R add to baset well I was saying maybe this  montages I think that's it now for stuff okay that was fair let's do Furniture we found what looked like the perfect place online but um it's a good thing it's was an interior design place the game plan for this visit was to leave with our
Dream sofa coffee table side chairs and bookshelf all locked in right time to bounce on some sofas do you mind by of course oh no that is not bouncy well but  work oh sorry after many bounces we started to figure out what we wanted we realized that a curved sofa was the best way of keeping people close together for both conversation and games but also that the material matters with sofas the two key types of cushioning are foam which is cheaper it holds its shape better and it's firmer and then feather
which really properly lets you sink in but can start to look a little bit scruffy over time after a lot of searching though we found one which was curved it was made with foam so it retained its shape but it was really soft foam so it almost had that plushness of feather yes yes now we just needed some lounge chairs to accompany that sofa it's an instant plus two  swivels I like swiel chairs oh my God actually really comfy and it rotate it's actually really nice try it and this was
the moment we realized we just found our Dream chair we also found a coffee table that we absolutely loved we initially came into this thinking that we wanted something higher but having actually sat around these low tables I could just see all of the amazing board game nights we could have gathered on the floor around something cozy like this now we just have to put it all together I sketched out where I wanted everything to go adding in a massive rug as well that complemented the curve of the sofa and
also at this point realized that we basically just turned our living room into a smiley face what was very cool though is that the company then in about 20 minutes turned that little handdrawn sketch into an actual two-scale drawing featuring the exact sizes of all the pieces we picked all we needed now was a bookcase to finish it all off I mean this is is basically exactly what we've been looking for just like giant Pokémon statues everywhere who needs board games and books but what colors do we go for
for all this stuff we're naturally bold color people so this screams to me this face right here says it all she asked me to try again so I did we would probably pick something like bring in books and Decor like this not main pieces and you know what this was good advice drisha and I are both naturally drawn to very bright colors but I feel like if we'd actually gone for the rainbow we initially came in looking for our room would have lost a lot of sophistication and there is one
more benefit of keeping things a little more muted which I'm coming to we slowly saw this room come together over the next few weeks first the sofa and the rug then the cabinet behind then honestly the best part was filling it we have had so many things boxed up for so long you know wedding gifts games we've been wanting to play and in one Fell Swoop we've been able to get everything out and then we managed to get in a few extra additions things we didn't realize we wanted initially and things that we
didn't even think we could fit into this space and that leaves us with the final product welcome to the living room and instead of just going around and pointing at stuff I think the best way to show you just how cool this room is is to show you the four key rules that we've made sure we followed and why those have paid off big time so this is going to seem like a really strange thing to say but number four is neutrality we first came into this thing wanting to plaster the entire room with
a rainbow of bold colors and if that's your thing then you should by all means go for it but the reason that I'm so glad we ended up keeping all the key pieces the rug the chest the sofas all a little bit more reserved is that we can rethe this room whenever we want to so you can see right now we got a blue theme going on here right well not anymore all we have to do is to swap a couple of plushies and the whole mood of the room changes and there's two pieces of tech that are making this
retheming so easy the first is the Philips Hue Lights for which we've got the two irises we bought in this cabinet we've got the floor standing lamp in the corner over there and then beneath the sofa the Philips hue light strip and I got to say if you were just going to do one of these get the sofa light this one strip makes such a difference to the vibe of this room I mean it's mood lighting while also elevating the design of your sofa literally think half looks like it's floating I guess because you would
expect there to be Shadow beneath that so when instead you see light it makes it look weightless we found that the floor lamp is a little bit more situational you need to have a corner that you can stick it into you need to have matching walls so that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb and you need to have a nearby plug socket so that it doesn't create a mess but do all of that and I think it does add enough of a kick of color to be worth the hassle the Philips Hue irises are somewhere in
between the two I'd say they look just as gorgeous as I was hoping they would and I also love how the way that they're angled upwards means that they give you both lighting at eye level but also Lighting on the ceiling above you which means that together with the lights underneath the sofa you're kind of surrounded by whatever color theme we decide to go for only thing I would say is given how much of a chungus this light actually is it's not putting out a whole lot of light it could be a little
brighter and again so could I and then the second part of this theming equation is the Samsung frame TV and having used this for a little bit of time now I have thoughts so on one hand when you think about it from an art perspective the value proposition here is absolutely insane you can very easily pay what this TV costs for one painting the size of this TV except if you go for this TV you get unlimited art pieces that you can change up in seconds now obviously it's not exactly the same as discovering a
quaint little Art Shop finding a piece you absolutely love and learning everything about it but if all you wanted to do was to display a bunch of jpeg images then this TV does actually make those jpegs look very much like real art especially if you can find images that have natural brush Strokes in them and it doesn't even waste a lot of energy the thing actually has sensors built inside of it that are designed so that the TV displays art when you're in the room and then it gets rid of the art
and turns itself off when you're out of the room with I would say about 97% Effectiveness not to mention this is a full-on 4K TV with internet with apps with speakers and it's quite a good TV at that I was very much expecting compromised image quality cuz that's what the early Samsung frames were like but now we're at the 2024 generation it feels pretty Flagship the only real issue that I've had with it is with the Samsung smart things app that you have to use to put art onto it it feels quite
buggy and I've had nothing unfixable but probably four to five times in the last few weeks where the app is not doing what I want it to but overall I would say this is an A+ tier product now even more important than all the colors and the theming is if we actually wanted to make this the perfect switch-off space then how do we make it as relaxing and as fun as possible so that's partly the obvious thing of just keeping stuff we like so a big part of that for me is as you can probably tell all of this
Pokémon stuff I've been collecting for the last 15 years Pokémon gets Prime position in this cabinet apart from drer who's right here this was a bunch of the stuff that I used for my proposal which I still can't quite to this day believe we pulled off we've got all of our favorite board games down here there's a very early collection of limited edition playing cards in here and then also just generally while we have filled most of the rooms in this house with sharp lines
everywhere because it makes things look clean with this room in particular we wanted to make sure it was filled with curves because it makes it look friendlier but then the other side to this equation is how do you create the systems to be able to have as much fun as possible I know organize fun it's the best kind so one thing that I'm very proud of is this this is the drisha UR gaming leaderboard so every single game we play together goes on this side made with tiles from Scrabble which is one of
the games by the way and then we spent a while trying to find the most bedazzled pins that we could use to represent each Victory so purple is her blue is me and we are uncannily close to 50/50 right now but I think this is such a good idea it adds so much tension to everything you do together knowing that there will be public humiliation when you lose and then these frames going all the way across the wall are for our holidays we spent about 4 years trying to figure out
what souvenir we should collect when we go away somewhere we love the idea of getting something but it's just that for us most mugs and fridge magnets just feel a little bit like clutter So eventually we decided let's just immortalize the best photo we take and that becomes our souvenir and it's just really fun because it's like a subquest every time you're away on holiday where we are trying in the background to get that Banger photo knowing that if we love it enough there's a space for it
it's pillar number two though where things start to get juicy convenience how do you make the room as functional as possible and as easy to use as possible for people without making it look tacky step one hide some Wireless charges I love having friends over but having had friends over for many many years I've come to the realization that the average person doesn't think as much about bringing their charging cable with them as us techies might and so I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is
instead of having to go to the top floor and rummage to find a cable with the right connector to now just be able to say hey pass me your phone drop it on there and done because yeah each of these pokeballs are actually 15 watt fast wireless chargers oh yeah if you're wondering by the way how I've hidden the cables in this room two things I would suggest one get cables as close to the colors of your surface as possible so for example everything that's wired in in this cabinet uses a black cable and
everything that's against one of the house walls uses white cables and then two is these transparent sticky pads this might just be the OCD part of my brain talking but I absolutely love how these can make sure that your cables are running only in the very corners and crevices and because they're transparent they themselves practically disappear I've shown you that we've got board games what I haven't shown you is well how you can take the nerdiness to a whole other level so wherever possible
we've actually bought 3D printed inserts to make sure that every piece inside has a place both inside the box and also outside when you're playing these drinks tables have been absolute game changers I wasn't completely sure when we first got them but having used them now they get used more than the main table cuz they give you the freedom to sit wherever you want to sit to have a drink to hand and also to not worry about spilling the thing cuz let me tell you even though they don't look
it these bad boys are heavy we have hidden an extension lead underneath the sofa in case you need to charge a Macbook although that is not encouraged in this room and it will result in a formal War morning but the single biggest game changer for convenience is something that you don't usually see this is homie they're sponsoring this video and from everything I've tested this is the most intuitive way to control your home cuz if you've ever tried to make your own Home Smart before
there's a very good chance you have also come to the realization that it's a mess it feels like every other one of these smart gadgets uses a different communication standard and so they don't talk to each other but homie brings them all together into one app so I've created an automation called fire side mode it took me less than a minute to do that by the way and when I tap this one command the Philips Hue Lights all change to Orange the room lights turn off very quickly my turn it turns on the
scent diffuser which you'll notice is a little different to the one we first bought that Hotel Collection one was great you'd actually be amazed how great it smells on the dark side but we started to realize that it was far bigger than it needed to be for this kind of space and that its remote was the most fiddly non-smart little thing that needed far too much manual control so we swapped it out for the rituals diffuser that's been a lot better better and also happens to look amazing in the
homie app it even turns on the fireplace which is bioethanol by the way so it takes a second to get going but if you are trying to build an indoor fireplace it is the way to go it doesn't release any smoke which is better for the environment but also you and then it also starts playing Smooth Jazz from these absolute monoliths all of these different devices being controlled through well basically one button on one app is absolutely insane and that brings me to the number one part of this room
the media experience and there's more to this than just the frame TV so first up these are the Meridian DSP h000 xes it's just called them the meridians we spent so much time back and forthing on whether or not we should go for speakers of this insane value but these have ended up lifting this room so much I think even from an aesthetic standpoint these things look so cool just futuristic and yet also really clean but it's the sound that is pristine to try and paint a very vague
picture the speakers that you have on the very best iPhones have about 3 watts of power the speakers that we put into our biggest iPhone ever that were kitted out to the Moon those were 400 WS These Guys "3,840 wats these things have the base" power of Hi-Fi systems genuinely eight times their size and it's so weird listening to them because you're sitting here and you're expecting to hear one two speakers but what you're actually hearing is this all-encompassing surround sound because of how these
things are designed to fire well actually most of their output sideways but then this is the creme La Creme of this room so open up homie again tap movie mode which is the second automation I've made and three things happen the Phillips Hue Lights go to 50% brightness and all turn red the Samsung TV turns on and opens up Netflix and the  down and honestly the best part of homie Pro is that it works locally without the cloud all with energy monitoring insights and an entire community of
users all making insanely cool things that you can do with your Home Products so these blinds I spent a long time searching for the right blinds for this house and we ended up going for a company called luxaflex which we got from CP Interiors because obviously when you bring your blinds down it's going to reduce the amount of light coming in and the amount of glare on your screen but these things also have really good acoustic properties so one part of that is reducing the amount of outside noise
that comes in but the other part of that is when you're sitting here watching a movie reducing the amount of inside noise that hits it and gets reflected back at you it's enough of a difference that even someone who's not completely dialed into audio quality can straight away tell there's much less Echo and the sound is way more precise and now while the sofas are cool and all this has to be the greatest seat to sit and watch TV in so long story short about 2 years ago my mom was having some back pain so
after a lot of research I found a massage chair from this company called weon we thought it was absolutely insane and then then just as we were putting this room together we realized the same company had released an upgraded model called the Grand presidential that also happened to perfectly match the neutral color profile of everything else and I genuinely think that this is the greatest massage chair on the planet it flips you into complete zero gravity it massages almost every part of your body
from your neck to your toes even comes around you to do your shoulders it's got built-in heating it's got 140 airbags for compression you got a privacy Hood LED therapy and even built-in speakers although we won't be using those for obvious reasons and because the thing doesn't just recline but actually rotates on its axis it actually takes up way less space than we thought it was going to you know pretty much the entire time when people are over at the house we lose someone and then we realize 10
minutes later that it's because they're sitting in this chair and that is the dream living room I'll catch you during the week for normal Tech videos and then again on the weekend for the next episode in the house series bye
