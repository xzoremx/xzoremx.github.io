we are about to build our Dream bedroom right here we're going to spend the next 5 minutes shopping trying to find out what makes the perfect bedroom and then actually turn those elements into a room perfectly optimized for Sleep let's just type in smart bedside table some of this stuff looks so n They just added LED lights everywhere yeah it seems like all of these smart bedside tables do two things lighting which we don't need more of and then charging but like really
slow outdated charging USB a what year is this oh my God that's beautiful I really like this this is perfectly boxy it really fits with the design okay so that's our base how do we make it actually smart Okay so charging let's get a three in one for our phone watch and airpods so what else do we want in this room cuz we want to keep this minimal we want it to smell good breathe good sleep good so we can literally get the same send diffuser as the living room there's actually a whole bunch of
tech that I've been wanting to get for a while that I think could take this bedroom to a whole new level I found something that I think is perfect for Aon can't go to bed at night without watching at least one episode of something so he's like fiddling his laptop on the little bedside table before we go to sleep and I thought this would be way easier so it's a bigger screen you can roll it around you can roll it next to you when you're watching at Night Roll it with you to the
bathroom if you want to carry on watching it worth a trying cool good find let's focus on air quality then yeah air quality is actually specifically important to me a because I've struggled a lot with sleep over the years but also be because I have a ton of allergies what is the absolute best air purifier we can get the air chip what it's the headboard that is chunky so it's kind of showing how it specifically targets the air cleaner to the area around where you st we want the
entire room purified wait what it's a PL box the top is a p and the bottom is the air purifier that's pretty cool cuz in a way it's like dual purification natural and electric the plant pot definitely looks better and is vastly more well suited to the aesthetic of the room on down I think this is really nice I think the idea of a steamer is really handy I think they clean they're simple so you imagine just kind of hanging clothes up and then using this to iron them also I
was thinking for the bathroom heater toilet we took a trip to Japan every toilet you sat on was heated and it was amazing what's the most like Bonkers toilet you could get I like the floating aesthetic oh my God it's "$8,699 now offers personalized settings" that let you find tune every option what what is it personalize it wow you are joking state-ofthe-art High Fidelity speakers is our toilet going to have better speakers than our room holy I have never in my life seen a toilet like
this before okay and the only thing left is speakers we've already gone and seen some at Meridian Audio and they're actually going to get planted into the ceiling including a subwoofer so we can have most comfortable mattress in the world wait I slept on a $1 million mattress wait this is the bed that Drake uses not that I wait that as a particularly strong celebrity endorsement oh my God so the company's called hastens I'm actually really curious there's so many things where you
don't know what you're missing until you've tried it and so I feel like we should at least try it to know what we're missing so we did and we very quickly realized upon visiting these hastens people that this was not your normal bed store literally you ask for the bed you want you can literally pull a figure out your head and say make it 4 M by 4 M and they will do that wait wait just so 4x4 M is for two people and someone will get a 4x4 me bed you don't ask questions no
everything is possible okay so with that absurd image in my mind time to find out what makes a bed worth well anything "more than about $1,000 really you have" horse hair pretty much in all the parts but the top mattress is almost entirely horse hair yeah horse hair and according to them there are two key reasons for it it's very springy it's like a ball of Springs in all directions smells quite nice yeah H Double Di and she's a vegetarian but also the we learned of a rather haunting
fact that the average adult releases 200 mL of sweat per night just sleeping and so the ability to not hold onto that moisture is equally as important it doesn't really go into it right yeah if you did that with human hair get drenched yeah you'd be drenched time to put it to the test starting with the more entrylevel beds that are around 25 ",000" wa oh it does that does hit different okay so pretty normal looking bed I got to say but the Comfort was no joke it's like a cloud around your body it turns
out that the beds also come with a bizarre complimentary service haston says that for the first few years of using their beds because it's all natural materials inside designed for airf flow that you have to keep it fluffed up and they will send people to your house to do said fluffing it will most likely be us wow or someone from my team that's crazy then something popped into my mind for a long time we've been using eight sleep for our bed it's like a mattress cover combined with this pod
that sits on the floor and pumps temperature controlled water through it to cool you down to your ideal temperature these guys are suggesting that with a bed like this you don't need that divorce ta hair does that for you yeah that's my I'm not completely convinced face if you put something on top of that you sort of remove a bit of that breedability function of the actual bed a lot of that is actually already in the bed at this point I think both of our minds were worrying we didn't really
come here with the intention of getting a haston bed and in a way everything about the way that they think about these things feels a little oldfashioned like some of the designs of these beds haven't been updated in 40 years but then at the same time lying on them moving in between our various sleeping positions and feeling both cushioned by these bed Toppers and then supported by the horse hair mattresses below them it was somehow starting to become a genuine consideration and then we tested the
dream one of their higher end beds the plushness of everything here is ridiculous oh my God this was like nothing we'd ever laid down on and also it only really dawned on us in this moment just how crazy it was that because each bed is made to order you can specify the exact dimensions that you want to the centimeter what was happening to us but there's one more the Big Daddy the grand vividus this is the bed that Drake uses and this is literally it's the caviar of beds and by caviar I mean the pH company
caviar who coats everything in Gold the base alone is made with all sorts of fancy materials including like Stingray leather there's only 15 people in the world authorized to make this bed and it takes them 600 man hours to do so just making one of these handles that you see on the side takes around 2 days to make and now it's time me no I'm kidding that's very very very comfy I preferred that one but this one is also really nice it's not what I expected it to be I expected like it's going to be
something that you just sink straight into but actually that would make it not a very good bed it's quite measured most comfortable with the dreaming actually wouldn't free wait what I grappled with my inner demons and tested a lot of other beds for the entire next week I trust technology and so the fact that we could genuinely spend a tenth of Hon's money and get a great mattress plus the eight sleep cover on top of that it felt like the obvious default Choice the more
beds we tested the more that it started to feel like 10% of the money can get you to 90% of the bed experience but then it's just how much do you value that extra 10% and to me I think the answer is actually a lot when it comes to sleep so after much deliberation I hit the order button on a 215x 215 CM dream a bed and now it's all ready so that's the main master bedroom but also all the guest bedrooms unless start there because I think these are particularly cool because we decided
that there's three countries that mean the most to us Japan our favorite holiday destination ever turkey the place we got married and then India which is where our families originate from so what we've done is we' themed each one of these guest rooms after one of them we've got matching trees plants paintings even a Pikachu themed to the room that you're in and we have had the time of our lives finding just the right soaps bath mats toothpaste and even I kid you not toilet roll to really
immerse people in these themes also every single bathroom has a scent related to the region so just takes you there I miss Japan and if you're curious this is what the India bedroom looks like we decided to embody the rich color of the country and the bathroom is themed after ayua which is an Indian approach to well-being and then turkey is all about that Mediterranean freshness when the bathroom is themed after the Turkish hanss which if you haven't been to one yet I highly
recommend and then in terms of the tech these guest bedrooms are obviously simpler than the master bedroom but there's still two cool things so one is these Samsung frame TVs just like in our living room if you haven't seen that episode yet but smaller and to be honest it's seeing them in the living room that made me realize we wanted them here because they complete the look of the room with the art people can use them as TVs with Simple Pleasures I really like how easy the Samsung remote makes it to
get to the three streaming services that we use the most and then also Samsung TV plus whatever the hell that is and then secondly you might remember these smart switches from the house tour well we have finally had time to figure out what to do with them so broadly speaking we decided that the best way to not make this house really confusing is for every switch to have the highest button turn all lights in that room to Max and then each button below that makes things dimmer and dimmer but
because these are control four buttons so they're linked to basically everything that can turn on in the entire house it means that well you can swap out buttons so we swapped the bottom for an up down switch that people can use to control blinds so let's click that now but it also means that you can hide functionality so let's say that you get woken up in the middle of the night and you hear noises coming from downstairs you can double press this top button and it will turn on not just
every single light in this room but every single light in the whole house and it will start playing a siren from every single speaker in the whole house I won't do that now for obvious reasons oh yeah and then the beds in every guest room are using Simba hybrid Ultra mattresses and I missed the cats so much that I had to get a mattress named after them they're on the FMA side but they're very supportive which means that when you pair them with a soft mattress topper like this it's Bliss no one ever
wants to get out but then also bit of a Russian nesting doll situation with these beds so we specifically went for ottoman Style beds because when even more guests come over we just pull them up and we can whip out three more double beds and we actually did quite a lot of testing before deciding that these things are the gold standard when it comes to air beds because they're from a company called Lost Horizons and the thing that is particularly cool about them is they're a combination of air but
also really high density foam so they are ridiculously comfortable for how thin they are and also they self-inflate when you want to use them and then when you're done with them they come with this air pump that just takes the air back out again it makes it very easy all right but obviously the guest bedrooms are pretty simple compared to the master bedroom that we use so let's do quick reviews of the key items that I think make this room special I'm going to give you my honest thoughts having now used
this frankly ludicrous haston bed for a bit of time and then I'm going to show you what might well be the biggest purchase mistake I have ever made in my life it made me want to put my head through a wall oh yeah just before we go into there this is a control 4 touchscreen it's pretty much the control center of the home and it works well but I also can't help but feel like it looks and functions like a smartphone operating system from the year 2008 which is why we're using this app called
homie that sits as a layer above and is a lot more intuitive ative and then this is the roboo cevo slim it's a robot vacuum with some pretty unique skills and we've picked it mostly because it is Slim enough such that it can fit under every single one of the Beds which gives us one less thing that we need to maintain right let's dive in now if you watched our empty house tour you'll know that the single objective while putting this room together was just how do we get the best sleep humanly possible it
is amazing how much good sleep can change your life and there's two key ways that we focused on achieving that the indirect effect which is just making the space as decluttered and automatic as possible to make it feel like all we need to do when we come into this room is to rest and then the direct effect which is finding products that are physically helping us to sleep better so let's start with one of the biggest ways to declutter well your entire life really a charging station setting all of
this up cost me about $30 and 3 hours like this is just a simple cable organizer box from Amazon which is where all our sockets are and then this is just cable trunking which makes sure that the cables are only visible when they absolutely need to be and I cannot recommend more if you have lots of gadgets like this to try and set up one of these because it means we automatically know where every product is all the time it means that you can barely see any cables it means that every single product we know is
automatically always charged this does a lot for that feeling of peace that you particularly want in a bedroom and it looks a lot better than the alternative as for the gadgets themselves let's do a rapid fire review so the therace is basically just a less powerful body massager but with a whole load of attachments that make it more suited to your face it's expensive for what it is but this thing is so effective at getting rid of headaches and specific migraines it makes you feel good while
making you feel like you're doing good 9 out of 10 this helmet that looks like it's from the year 2200 is the wayon imic it actually came with the massage chair that we got for the living room and this is basically the hardcore version of that I'm one of those people where when I get a massage I want to feel like there's someone snapping me in half and this does that it's very firm I'd give these an eight the pyo 2 is like for any item of clothing that's a little bit fuzzy or just one that gets
dusty quickly you just swipe this over and it's got six tiny little razor blades inside of it that trim it without cutting it seven out of 10 we're always glad we have this when we suddenly realize that we need it oh yeah I love this toothbrush it's right on that upper limit of feeling like it has enough power that it's really thoroughly cleaning you but just not so much that it feels like you've just erased your enamel not to mention wireless charging on the brush itself and USBC charging on
the case which is always a big tip 8 out of 10 I also always use a water flosser just before brushing it's just a really fast way of getting rid of those Rogue food particles that would otherwise get stuck or a refreshing pre-bed beverage I think these are really slept on pun not intended 9 out of 10 oh yeah you like this while I long for the day where every single battery of every single Gadget is fully rechargeable for the gadgets that aren't we have finally got our battery act together so this is a
battery organizer you can get them for like $20 on Amazon and this is not just Soul fulfilling satisfying but it's also really useful because you know for sure that you have every battery and then you have a really clear at a glance way of seeing if you don't now also in the vein of slightly OCD things that put my mind at ease while making this bedroom video we have pretty much fallen in love with a site called Joseph Joseph it's just this unending stream of products that
you see and you're just like why didn't I think of that so for example we went through a few different hangers until eventually decided that the ones from Joseph Joseph are just perfect they keep both parts of your outfit together in a way that you can also just take off and wear one and then these rail spaces up here are something that I never even thought about before I saw them but tell me it wasn't worth it by making sure that every single item of clothing is exactly the same distance apart without
you needing to get your roller out each time you put something away makes it so easy to keep the cabinets clean oh and also they come in two sizes so we got the regular size spaces for the more casual clothes and then if we come to the end over here this is the formal cabinet where we have the large size spaces which as you can tell I am making the most of the other thing that I really like here is this steamer so this is from the same company who made the pyo in the other cabinet and it's not
quite enough to get your clothes to the 100% you know when you want your shirt to look so crisp that it could cut someone but it does iron clothes to the 95% Mark with about 20% of the effort because all I need to do is to power it on and then brush it down the clothes while they're still on their hangers oh and then for all the products that we use regularly I decided it just makes sense to go out once and buy them in bulk and just make a little Top-Up station kind of like a survival shelter
but you know for silky smooth skin okay so that's all my pedantic storage stuff now for the things we actually keep out so very quickly this is disa's dressing table so there's all her makeup in here this is also using Joseph Joseph organizers and then my plan for this draw is to have all of her hair dryers and straighteners but in a way so that it's wired into the mains all the time by drilling a hole in the back of this and roting the cable down here but that's just me and then this is the air
purifier that we've ended up with we went on a bit of a loop with this one as you saw we bought these plant pot ones initially from a company called Dupre and they were cool in concept but they just felt cheap and not very good at either being a plant pot or an air filter then we got this one from a company called molecule way Slicker really powerful and also beautiful it just fit the room perfectly but it just kept waking us up at night even when we specifically put it onto its quiet
setting it would just randomly decide at 3:00 a.m. that turning up its suction to 11: to ingest one Rogue dust particle was more important than our sleep and so we ended up landing on the big plus quiet filter by Dyson which when I first saw it I was like that's a stupid name for a product then you use it and you realize oh it's big and it's quiet so in terms of blinds we've got the same luxaflex company making them as we do in the living room downstairs but in all the bedrooms we've got ones
fitted with an extra layer of fabric that makes them blackout blinds to completely kill the light and also cut down on a further 20% of outside noise and I would say I love the way these work you can control them on your phone they practically disappear when they're away and they look really clean when they're down the only annoying thing is you need these little hubs so that they can be communicated with and the bigger your house the more hubs you need so we had to get and hide a total of nine of
these in our various different rooms which is a little bit of a pain and now just for my infuriating mistake let's talk about the bed area so we went for two snake plants one on each side I love these things I think they look spicy and yeah you'd need a lot of them to significantly change the air quality in a room but they do make a difference and I think even just psychologically feeling like you have that extra bit of freshness and oxygen from a real plant is good for you you might have noticed
that the bedside tables have changed since the ones that you originally saw us by we had to go through like four different sets of them because some of them had drawers that didn't close nicely some of them weren't tall enough to properly cover the sockets in the room until eventually we found these ones from Andrew Martin that are far more expensive than what we wanted to spend on bedside tables but they take every box anyway the most important thing is what is on them so you'll
notice on mine we have ended up with an iPad here and this is another one of those things that have taken multiple attempts to get right cuz if you remember for a long time I used to bring my laptop into the bedroom to watch some sort of American sitcom just before bed they knock me straight out then brisha had this idea of the LG standby me this rollable TV which we bought we tested and in a way it was amazing I was used to a 14in screen suddenly having 27 was crazy but it actually wasn't ideal for
two reasons one that the larger your screen the further back you have to put it and then the further back you have to put it the louder it's got to be which actually doesn't really work because I'm at the lowest risk of disturbing drisha if I actually have a quieter speaker that's just closer to me but then the even bigger issue was minimum brightness the TVs just wasn't low enough whereas on this iPad Pro you can go extremely low and also on top of that to use night shift mode to further reduce the amount
of blue light and so yes it is a bit excessive to have an iPad that just sits here when I already own a Macbook that largely does the same thing but I just decided that this is important to me because it means that I can leave my laptop and therefore my work downstairs before coming to the bedroom and this iPad isn't even logged into anything apart from relaxing stuff so it helps me to associate this room with switch off now this charger is another one of those awesome situations where we'd already
decided that we loved ESR before the company reached out and asked to sponsor this video and the reason we picked these is pretty simple we originally bought Amazon Echo for each bedroom because we thought yeah it'd be really nice for people to have a clock but it's only after buying those that we remembered the iPhone standby mode is basically the same thing but is better so what we're actually looking for is just a really good charger that can hold people's iPhone sideways while charging
to activate this mode and this is that while being the fastest iPhone ch2 mag safe charging it vishes around 30 minutes faster than other chargers because of something called cryoboost every phone has a safety mechanism built in such that when they get hot they reduce their rate of charging but that isn't so much of an issue when your charger is also the thing that calls your phone especially if you're watching videos or FaceTiming while charging and then to top the whole thing off it's
charging my watch at the back and now it's charging my airpods at the front and it can charge the watch faster than other non-apple certified Brands while being quite a bit cheaper than official Apple stuff link below for more so that's my side of the bed what about the bed okay I'm going to level with you I think we might have made a mistake here and this isn't even our biggest mistake and don't get me wrong I'm not saying this is not a glorious sleeping experience and the
fact that the thing is 215 by 215 means you could practically sleep four people here the thing is though after ordering this I just recently set up all of my family back home with the newest eight sleep bed covers and I was looking at the feature set of these things thinking damn this doesn't do any of that I mean as well as the normal ability to adjust temperature it can now even like lift your mattress up and down to stop you snoring in the night without waking the other person up but you can't get eight
sleep for a bed like this and so it's left me in this position where I think this is the absolute Pinnacle of beds without technology but it feels like there is also a ceiling for how good a bed can be without that technology so to put it another way I'm very happy and very grateful that we've been able to get this bed but at the same time if if I were to do it again from scratch I would probably get one of the Simba hybrid Ultra mattresses that we have in the other rooms stick an eight sleep
cover on top spend a fraction of what we have on this and sleep just as well if not better there's speakers in the ceilings there's airon right above here and we use that to set this room to 18° C you sleep better if the room is cool you don't sleep at all if the room is cold so that's where we settled and then on drisha side this is the new 12th gen Kindle paper white I don't know how we've had 12 generations of this thing but this this is actually really nice because it wirelessly charges on this
stand here the screen is much more responsive than Kindles from the early days and the benefit of this is that she can read at night without casting any light towards me while I'm trying to sleep plus we've also set it to automatically reduce the amount of blue light for when she's reading at night which again keeps sleep intact and then this is the same ritual scent diffuser that we got in the living room downstairs so that is the Sleep area there's no rugs because in our
experience they just trap allergens and there's no desks because well was specifically trying to keep work out oh yeah this so from the beginning I knew that I wanted to have a really big bold colorful art piece here but every single one I could find was either literally more expensive than this bed or just terrible like I hated it so yesterday I decided to go to a craft store buy a load of spray paints and just literally just make this myself I call it think very different I'll let you stew on that one
and then this is the xiaomi NightLight from that crazy xiaomi gadgets video video I just loved it so much that I've actually set one up in every bedroom right you ready to see my big blunder now okay in the bathroom oh by the way I thought this was really cool if you've ever played a Pokémon game you will know that you have six Pokémon in your party this is six bath bombs and inside each bath bomb is a Pokémon so over time we'll learn who our party is so the issue has been the numi toilet that you
saw us buy it wasn't available in the UK so we ordered it from the US and it arrived it's just that when it arrived we realized that because it's a US toilet the water supply pipe connects down through the floor whereas here in the UK it's more typical to have it coming out into the wall and in this particular situation there was no way of retrofitting it so we basically had to take one giant L and buy a completely different toilet I spent "$10,000 on that one on the bright side"
the one that we ended up getting the jebber Aqua Clean mirror is actually also amazing it's got a nightlight and motion sensor baked in so you literally walk up to the toilet it turns on this soft light and the lid opens there's the fact that the second you sit down a deodorizer starts which I assume a lot of people will also like because it masks the noise the seat starts heating up there's a full magnetic remote control there's a customizable biday this is so cool the flush creates a
Whirlpool on the inside for maximum cleaning efficacy so it all worked out in the end I I can't actually believe that we get to stay here so next weekend is the kitchen video and for now good night
