these are the most shockingly realistic key caps starting with the Lego this is incredible it's an actual ow what it does mean is you can create whatever you like on top this is a house plant key cap my God the details on we go these next ones are actually Mentor resemble candy wait what goes down like that my brain is refusing to let me believe this is not a sweep did they actually make a dumpling key c cap so the steamer connects directly into your keyboard oh and then the
dumpling magnetically attaches to it so you're typing away you're working but then you get a little bit hungry this is hard cheese this is actually the first time I wish it was a little bit less detailed and then to complete one of the stranger meals I've had today this is the cappuccino key cap which also presses the key next to it every single time you click this is an extremely premium box for a keycap it's one of the guns from the Apex Legends game but I did not expect it to be fully made out
of metal that's an interesting sound there is one key to rule them all
