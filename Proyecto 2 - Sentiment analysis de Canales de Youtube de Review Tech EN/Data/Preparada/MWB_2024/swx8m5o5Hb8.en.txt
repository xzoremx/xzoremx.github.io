"how old is your hearing so this is 8,000" htz if you can hear sound at this frequency then your hearing counts as functional and I wish mine wasn't as we raise the frequency to "12,000 you have to either be" specifically below the age of 50 or just have very good hearing to be able to "hear it at 15,000" HZ you need to be below 40 years old really glad my hearing still works the reason this happens by the way is fundamentally loud noises damage your "ears so this is 16,000 HZ yes"
I can still hear it which indicates that my hearing age is below 30 years old "this next one is going to be 17,000 Herz" and if you can hear this your hearing age is below 25 which means I would be defying my physical age I think I can hear something and if "you can hear 19,000" Hertz yeah it ain't happening for me you have the hearing of someone under 20 years old
