we are about to build our Dream Zen oppos set up we're going to spend the next 5 minutes buying all the tech and the fun stuff and then we're going to put it together to create the most beautiful workspace that you've hopefully ever seen okay so desk we currently use one called the secret lab Magnus Pro it's just a little bit too gamer RGB for this room I think my key thing is Cable Management no cables I want it to look just complete and clean oh I like that yeah minimalist would do
than this there's the E7 Pro this feels a lot cleaner this cable 100 yeah it's right to the very very back which is got to be out of your line of sight let's do that okay yeah all right let's do it so chair wise I've been internally debating a few different options this is the airon by Herman Miller you know the current chair I have in the studio that's also Herman Miller what do you think the design it doesn't fit but it's functional yeah it's got to be a balance obviously ergonomics are the priority
but the dream scenario is if we can get ergonomics and design okay this is another option so this is the steel case gesture so this is the one that New York Times said is the best desk chair based on its flexibility or also the ability to customize that we get exactly the shade of color we want that's pretty nice so they did a massive study that found nine new postures that are not adequately addressed by current seating Solutions it's pretty cool wait so you start off working then you're leaning in
lying back yeah let's do it I want to try every one of those positions on the chair so I found this here other day this is the Samsung flip Pro and I swear to God in my 14 years of covering Samsung products I had no idea this was a thing it seems like it's a massive screen that's got a touch pen so it's in interactive you can actually project up to six different displays onto this one display so every couple of months we do these team days where we get together the 10 or so people on our team and so
here six people at a time could share their screens onto this massive screen and then we can annotate on top of that that's a Next Level collaboration okay I think we absolutely need this so what about the stuff that we actually put on the desks so I think we already put together a pretty banging setup in our old house we just need to make it light theme and then use this change as an opportunity to upgrade the things that we can  invisible undersurface wireless charger you put this underneath your desk and
your desk becomes the wireless charger that is seamless I'm not sure I trust it but I'm curious so one idea I had was if we're really trying to go with this theme of like Tranquility nature elements some way to get Tree in it it sounds crazy but I kind of like it have you seen big Bonsai yes they look absolutely stunning but do you know how much Bonsai are the more aesthetically pleasing the shape of the real Bonsai the more you pay and for the nice ones "I've seen them for like 100,000 okay so"
what about Fage and some fake options this is way bigger than I was expecting that is awesome the only other option is we could go for a real tree but just a different style I think you're right that it's going to be really hard to maintain a real tree but I think we can get real real plants around the room but this one big tree can be an artificial one surely for The Vibes we should look into it yeah I'm really starting to build a picture of this room like imagine tree surrounded
by rocks and there's some sort of element of flowing water I love the sound of trickling water and make it's so peaceful something like this yes yes okay this is actually crazy they can create a custom stain in the steel mesh to make the water have whatever movement pattern that you want it to the only thing left to do was to finish off each of our desk setups with a few personal touches I'm going to level with you I was really nervous about how this room is going to turn out we took a lot of
gambles here I mean I've never bought a water feature before let alone two that are both bigger than me I feel like this tree could have looked incredibly fake this joinery behind it just a waste of space and this Moss wall yes we ended up going for a full-on wall to wall Moss feature it's the kind of thing that could have looked very tacky but I think we have just pulled it off well welcome to the dream office so let me show you the Next Generation desk setup and then I want to
show you my absolute favorite thing in this room okay the Mr who the boss desk setup 2.0 it actually looks like there's a lot less going on than before but there's actually a lot more so just for this keyboard for example I went through seven other keyboards that I thought would be great before settling on this one every one I tried had a different issue one was too high so I got wrist strain from bending one was too resistive so it required a tiring amount of force to activate the keys and
another one of them was just too loud for a communal space and I'm really starting to sound like Tech Goldilocks right now you very quickly realize that nothing on a spec sheet will actually tell you how a keyboard is going to feel under your fingers but then I found this  ready yes it is glorious very fast to type on you don't have to press hard it's really low profile for a mechanical keyboard but it's still got that great the thunk with each key I love these little side lights that we can use to
accentuate the whole Japanese zen garden theme that we've got going on the funny thing about this keyboard and actually the really impressive thing about this keyboard is after I tested all these seven keyboards I handed them all to drisha to test and then I handed them all to Joseph or everything guy to test and both also decided that this one was their favorite so they've done something right here but then this is nearly as important as the keyboard itself I also went through so many wrist rests we
started off with this one from lights that you could actually flip to adjust its height but even on the lowest setting it was too high there's this Cloud one that to me just didn't feel plush enough I nearly gave up on this Mission until I tested a keyboard from Razer called the type Ultra didn't even think much of the keyboard the wrist it came with oh my God this is literally everything I've been looking for it's super plush like a pillow it's very clean looking it's white and silver and
then when I found that it was still just a tiny bit too high for me I realized I could flip it around and that was a big moment it all suddenly just slotted together and then the mouse is the MX Master 3s it's exactly the same mouse that I used to use but now in white and that's because this is actual Perfection it works on any surface the battery lasts for about 2 and 1/2 months the clicks are really satisfying but at the same time silent which is great when there's people around and then also you
don't just have a vertical scroll wheel you also have a horizont Al scroll wheel I can take that educating the masses and my wife and then finishing off that Trio is this mouse mat I just think there's something really nice about having an oversized mouse mat and it's not like you're actually going to pick up your mouse and start using it over here but it's the feeling that you can which is it's kind of like the appeal of open plan living as opposed to having everything split
into separate rooms which is something that we were specifically looking for with this house and again we tried quite a lot of these before deciding that we didn't like the way that the stitched fabric ones looked and that this faux leather was definitely the way to go okay taking a step back for a minute we really lucked out with these chairs it's much easier to test keyboards and mice and mouse mats than it is chairs so when we ordered these that was pretty much us committing to these Steelcase gestures
but very first time I sat down on this thing my back just went zip and it was like it was almost violating but like very posture correcting then then I realized that it's also like the most adjustable chair I've ever sat on so I have right now about six different things that I can control there's the obvious up and down I mean that works as normal but then I rotate the outside part of that same knob and that's actually seat depth so the seat just gets longer and that actually does make
it more comfy because my legs are right now being supported right up until my knees there's another dial here that lets you choose how much force is required for the back to recline so I've set M so that it's easy enough that it doesn't feel like I'm pushing while having enough resistance that it doesn't feel like I'm or falling it's really really freeing it kind of feels like the chair is an extension of me like I'm never thinking about the chair I'm just thinking what position do I want to be
in and this makes that possible while keeping my spine aligned there's adjustable lumbar support on the back you can change how far the headrest comes out but I've got to say the crowning jewel is these armrests there's a little paddle underneath them and if I hold that I can go all the way down I can come all the way up I can go all the way out I can come all the way in there's more I can rotate them to whatever angle I want and then I can even decide how far forward or backward
they come and the reason this is such a game changer well bring them to the same height as the desk angle them in a little bit come forward and all of a sudden this extends my wrist support all the way to my elbow I can have my arms at the perfect 90Â° angle all the time and I can say with 100% confidence as someone who usually does struggle with typing for long periods of time I have never been more comfortable this combination of items and positions seems to have actually fixed a very real
long-term issue that I've been having and you can probably tell how much joy that brings me okay just before we get to the meaty back end of this setup where I would say it goes from good to god tier what is this well we knew we liked the idea of some sort of acoustic paneling you want the office to be a quiet place especially since we're so close to the kitchen we started off by looking at wooden paneling like this but it just didn't feel exciting enough so this is from a company called plant plan
and I think it's absolutely incredible the way it works is you first agree on a design they then build that design but split it into lots of smaller panels so they can ship it and bring it in and then they slot all of those pieces together using spare Moss that they bring with them to patch up the seams where possible and what I love is that the day this thing got installed we walked in and 60% of the echo in this room had just disappeared the only thing was there wasn't quite enough light on
it so me being me we created a whole extra frame around it so that we could have an LED that spills light onto it and here we are the end product is I mean it's it's beyond my wildest dreams for something that we could have in an office especially when you compare it to the Cubby Hall in the kitchen that we used to work in we tried to think of a joke where this is the Mr who's the Moss logo mossen very good oh but then also what about this desk well this is kind of awesome so after already deciding to
buy flexis Spot the flexispot company actually reached out to sponsor this video and this is like the easiest integration we've ever done cuz this E7 Pro is not the most expensive sit stand desk it's not the fanciest sit stand desk but it might just be the best one the value is insane it's just that the fundamentals are so good this thing has a 160 kg carrying capacity which means you can put practically anything on this desk and you can lean as much as you want this thing has effectively zero
wobble which is honestly a rarity with standing desks like vigorous typing is usually enough to cause monitor wobble not here and this tray at the back has actually been the only way we've managed to achieve our cable management goals but I'm getting to that and if you're not happy then flexi spot offer over 30 days of a free return window and over 10 years of warranty so you can just try it so onto the back now this is the journey Nova it's a ch2 fast wireless charger for your phone but also an airpods
charger with a little mood lighting I've gone for the airpods pro too by the way because they sound great the noise isolation is practically unmatched for inair earphones and they wirelessly charge plus this journey also has a hidden watch charger too that you can pull out from the back I think it's a really sexy bit of Kit to be honest but also the way it's designed it crams a lot of functionality into something that has quite a minimal desk footprint also I've specifically chosen for it to sit
here so so that I can still see if anything comes in but I can't immediately reach it cuz for me that creates enough of a barrier that I'm only going to grab it if it's something important as opposed to something mildly distracting whoa while drer and I have gone for those on our desks Joseph has actually gone for the charger thing and it works does so when you're installing it you get this led mat that shows you how much power the thing is providing to each spot and then you use that to
determine where The Sweet Spot is and therefore where you're going to put this sticker down so the idea of having my phone all the way over there and having to reach for it was uh a little bit traumatic so I thought have it right within hand's reach was a good idea so moving on this is a terrarium that I found on Etsy the way that I've been thinking about this is we have this absolutely enormous towering wall of greenery over here if we don't tie that into the rest of the room it's going to
look really out of place and that's why every part of the room I've made sure that we've dotted it with elements of that Mossy green we actually got some artificial Moss that I put up the base of the big Bonsai I think it comes together really nicely now on top of this monitor this is the new BenQ screen bar Pro and this is very cool for a few reasons so in our previous desk setup in the old house we used to have the Ben Q screen bar Halo which had this little puck remote that
you'd use to control it this doesn't even need it it's got a tiny little speaker here which emits very high frequency sound waves which are outside the range of human hearing and then it has a sensor that figures out how long those soundwaves take to get back thus determining if you're sitting in your seat and if if you are it gently wakes itself and if you leave after 5 minutes it turns itself off which is not just better for the old Energy bill but it's just one less thing that you need to
think about I literally sit I type my password and I am in this setup is so easy to use with now one further less piece of desk clutter since I don't need a remote for the light it's also 30% brighter than the last screen bar it gets like perfectly even desk coverage since the light is coming directly from above instead of from one side the only one thing that it doesn't have that the old one did is a light behind the screen bar that would light up the wall behind you to reduce the fatigue on your eyes
but since we're not up against a wall anymore that wouldn't do anything anyways and now in terms of the monitor itself as you saw we ended up going for Dells these are 40in curved ultrawide 5K resolution screens with a 120 HZ refresh rate and they are exactly as good as that spec makes it sound while also tying into the whole white and silver for everything that goes on this desk zero regrets for this honestly which is funny because I totally associate Dell with the budget bulk order Tech from
school computer rooms back in the day but this is where we get to some of my proudest work so the Dell comes with a stand just like basically any monitor but what we've done is swapped out each one of those stands for an ergotron HX articulating arm and not just because it sounds like Megatron's best friend I think it adds a lot to this feeling of openness that I've been trying to create you know the the same reason that we have such massive desk mats it means that if you
feel like you want to move your monitor back to relieve your eyes you push it back if you feel like there's too much sun coming in you can rotate it it means that if you decide that you like your chair really high but then your desk a little bit low because it gives you good typing posture then you can just push the monitor up or down to still keep it perfectly at eye level all with two other benefits the arm takes up less room on your desk than the stand this one is particularly enormous for some
reason and it has also helped me to pull off the most hardcore cable management job of my lifetime so as you heard earlier from the very beginning of planning out this room we knew that we wanted to have zero cables on show if we could get to that that was a crazy thing to say so casually we had absolutely no idea at the time what trying to achieve that goal would involve because if you step back and really think about it there are so many things going against us achieving that in this room there's
only two sets of main sockets but this is the single room with the most devices connected there is not one or two but there are three full desks which we need to power everything on all the cables they come out into the room as opposed to it being the other way around and backing against a wall where you can just kind of shove them behind and not worry about them but then as if we needed one the final boss of cable management issues is that because we went for sit stand desks there's
movement involved so you can't just tape every cable down there has to be Flex the long and short of it is every spare evening I've had for the last 2 weeks I've been in this room testing all sorts sorts of different Arrangements of tapes and cable holders and cable management mechanisms and one by one we actually did figure out how to hide each and every cable however we needed to shout outs to double-sided transparent sticky tape uh these cable sleeves from Alex Tech which keep all of the smaller wires
together to make it look like one clean thicker cable and this rug there's actually a third set of power sockets in this room but they're right in the very middle we originally assumed there's absolutely no way we're going to be able to use them without turning this room into one of those Mission Impossible laser trip wire scenes every time you walk in but this rug only just covers the power sockets while getting close enough to these desks to make the power cables going to them basically disappear
while also in itself looking like raped sand just like you see in a Japanese zen garden so powering the whole thing then is the M4 MacBook Pro I've gone for a Macbook because I like the idea that I have one computer so when I go somewhere I unplug it and that's the one I take with me and this is as you'd probably expect given the price a Flipping Fantastic computer the only thing I would say is while the jump between Intel MacBooks and apple silicon powered MacBooks was game-changing in terms of
especially battery life everything since that has felt pretty incremental like I noticed practically zero difference when I switched from an M2 MacBook Pro to an M4 MacBook Pro and then just before my number one favorite thing in this room couple of finishing touches so this wow is fluid stance the level in the old setup we had the basic fluid stance plane board and honestly I think it's very expensive for what it is but then like it's not expensive for what it means for me like if you properly
measured the materials it's just a bunch of plastic and foam that they're charging over $100 to buy but then if you think about it another way that plastic and foam allowed me to stand while I was working it kept my core active and it gave my body something to do for 3 to 4 hours every single day and that's very valuable to me so we decided this time to up up grade from the plane to the level this is their top end model and yes it has fancy materials and yes it gives you slightly more space but I
mostly went for it just because it fits the room's aesthetic way better we got the desk cycle 2 under dr's desk and it is surprisingly good it's very quiet and it's also got a surprising amount of resistance for something so tiny like this isn't just something to do with your legs it can be a workout if you wanted to we also wanted to get some speakers in here you know in case you want to have a little boogie while you work but we were also very aware that if you have some big floor standers in the
middle of this room it's going to kill the decluttered vibe that we're trying to build so we found these speakers from Meridian which have a really wide cone of sound and we stuck them in the ceiling and then we found this subwoofer from the same company and we knocked it up there this is actually a really powerful setup this could well be the vup RVE spot and then this is the Samsung flip Pro originally we were very much under a bigger is better mentality and we went ahead and ordered the 86 in
version but very quickly realized it completely killed the vibe we swapped it out for the 55 in one and now I actually like it we mostly just use it as a whiteboard this is actually particularly good at planning out the logistical nightmare that is this video series but with all the benefits of it being digital plus like just having a screen that you can roll around into any room you want designed so that it can directly connect to practically any Gadget you have it will never not be useful
I just connect that perfectly doesn't do that automatically does it oh my God okay so you've seen light mode now it's time for dark mode and with that this is my personal favorite thing about this office and I do need to Cave at that because having two large water features like this especially indoors is not a joke there are layers of Maintenance you have to think about air humidity you have to think about waterproof paint but just look at it so simple waterfalls from the the top and
this metal mesh provides the easiest surface for the water to flow down but because there's nothing else to it and because we've added these matching wooden enclosures around the top and the bottom to make them look like part of the room it's just so minimal and I was saying this to drisha the other day watching these things is so close to that mesmerizing feeling of watching fire you get this really soothing sound effect and it never looks the same twice and that's the office remember to check
out flexi spot for these absolute Beauties and they're also having a Black Friday sale so if you are interested now's a pretty good time and I'll catch you in the next one
