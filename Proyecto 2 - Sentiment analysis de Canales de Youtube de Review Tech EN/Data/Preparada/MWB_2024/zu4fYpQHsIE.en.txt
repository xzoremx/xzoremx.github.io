"$1 chair versus $5,000 chair how" comfortable can you get first up is the $1 chair which has a really nice folding mechanism but it's just a bit smaller than I was expecting ow it did not support my weight zero out of 10 for $50 though you can get something you can actually sit on ooh my back feels very straight but calling this comfortable would be a bit of a stretch three out of 10 but then we have the $500 Herman Miller in body which is designed specifically with ergonomics in mind this is the kind of
chair that's not just good feel your posture but comfortable too 7 out of 10 "for $11,000 though on the complete" opposite end of the spectrum this is the squidget zero hard frame zero edges just hundreds of thousands of tiny foam chips 9 out of 10 "for $5,000 then this the wayon Felicity" it's zero gravity it's heated it's got stereo speakers next to ears touchscreen controlled for the massage functions and even its own headset to continue the massage around your entire face 10 out of 10
