on the 18th of June 2024 Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world at $ 3.34 trillion they overtook Microsoft Apple Samsung alphabet it's hard to stress just how big of a deal this is I mean Pok√©mon you know the highest grossing media franchise in the world this could buy that company 36 times and we know Nvidia you might even be watching this video using one of their graphics cards in your PC but we're talking a company that overtook Apple you know the guys who managed to
sell luxury smartphones to like a third of the world population you don't beat that just with some high-end PC graphics cards so what on Earth have a media done to a get themselves to a position where they could even dream of overtaking all the other big tech companies and B actually overtake them and one thing that I need to make super clear which makes this all the more surprising is that Nvidia only started in 1993 which is recent enough that the guy who is now CEO Jensen hang he was the same guy who
founded the company along with two other guys Jensen used to work as a waiter's assistant in a local Denny's Dino when he was younger he fell in love with computer science and So eventually went from there to getting his dream job working with AMD one of the leaders at the time as a microprocessor designer until one day when he decided I got an idea Jensen basically realized the key thing that was holding PCS back from unparalleled performance which I'm getting to so he booked a table all the
way back where it began at a Denny's diner with these two other guys and that is famously where they hatched the plan to form Nvidia there's literally a plaque on the wall where that meeting happened but in video didn't have its name at this point do you know where that came from well most of the guy's files documenting their plans about this future company had been pretty uncreative named next version so when they decided that we're actually doing this they looked up words that included
Envy in that order and they found the Latin word Invidia which is the name of an ancient Roman goddess Invidia was the personification of Envy a pretty unpleasant lady with a poison tongue and green eyes thus the name Nvidia was born so the brand name basically means next version Envy kind of saying you're going to be so jealous of our next chip and now that you know where the Greene Eye logo comes from you too will no longer be able to see it without also seeing this haunting image alongside it so
you're welcome and now that you know you will see this origin all across their branding too like the slogan for the GeForce 8 series graphics cards was Green With Envy and the company's highest n gpus for a long time they were called Titans and this Nvidia was believed by some ancient Greeks to be the daughter of a Titan so it all LS together but what actually made Nvidia different what was this big idea that they were getting together for well in 1999 Nvidia released the GeForce 256 the
first chip ever to be marketed as a graphics Processing Unit or GPU a piece of Hardware that could sit alongside your CPU which at this time could only process one calculation at a time and take on the graphics rendering load while you're gaming using far more efficient parallel processing it was designed to divide big tasks that would previously be done very slowly into smaller parts and then distribute those parts amongst many many small process of CES which in turn freed up people's
actual CPUs to focus on things like in-game physics the concept of the GPU quickly caught on in both PC and console gaming which pretty much revolutionized gaming and very quickly turned Nvidia into a household name and Nvidia has absolutely killed it with gpus ever since then um fun fact actually this is the graphics card I installed on the first ever PC I built every couple of years they come on stage they've announced a new generation of graphics cards and they've been so successful at
making each one a leap above the last that they're now out selling their traditional rival AMD you know the company who Jensen originally got his dream job working at to a ridiculous extent with nvidia's first quarter Revenue this year at $26 billion compared to amd's well measly 5.5 billion but they didn't get as big as they are today just by coasting on GPU sales here's the rocket fuel that made their growth just explode Nvidia made a huge bet on AI in 2006 Nvidia released
Cuda compute unified device architecture which they could have done a better job naming for something that's actually a bit of a game changer it was a software platform that allowed the developers of apps to properly utilize the full power of Nvidia gpus even for non-g graphics tasks developers could take tasks that would usually be performed one by one on the CPU course and instead just like they've been able to do with games on Nvidia gpus split those tasks up and perform parallel processing using the
thousands of GPU calls they now had access to this was a big moment for apps it made nvidia's graphics cards the tool for much more than just gaming they became the gold standard for video editors for financial modelers cryptocurrency miners anyone who wanted to do anything with a computer and most importantly for any company wanting to build and train a big powerful AI model how do you do that not on CPUs which are doing things one step at a time but instead by harnessing the full power of
a GPU and which GP are you most likely going to pick Nvidia Nvidia being the first company to unlock the full computational power of the GPU for the average developer meant that their Cuda software became the default option developers got comfy with it it improved very quickly and because this Cuda programming environment was built specifically around nvidia's Graphics chips it was super efficient it's very similar to how efficient iPhones are because every thread of that iOS
software is designed around every fragment of the iPhone hardware and with this by being very forward Thinking by working with other tech companies on AI for literally the last two decades Nvidia became embedded into the very fabric of artificial intelligence whether it's researchers wanting to run complex simulations to figure out what proteins could potentially cure major diseases or Tesla wanting to train algorithms for their self-driving cars Nvidia became the crutch to lenon
literally right now Tesla is nearing completion on a supercomputer cluster at their Texas gigafactory which is supposed to improve Tesla's full "self-driving using $50,000 Nvidia gpus" and a sub to the channel would be GP youtiful that also could have been better and so when AI development exploded over the last couple of years with every single person and their dog now having access to tools like chat gbt Gemini and more what's running all of that when we ask for an image of a
robotic Flamingo doing rolly poy on the moon what's processing that AI request yes Nvidia but another crazy bit of context nvidia's Tech is also what powers Amazon web services which is the world's most broadly adopted web services provider they're the company who builds the infrastructure for basically 30% of the cloud-based internet so the chances are pretty high that anytime you visit a website there is NVIDIA Tech somewhere along the pipeline that's bringing it to you so
that explains the first part of this puzzle how Nvidia became the sole arms dealer of the chips required for the now massive AI industry arms race but how did they go one step further to actually overtake every single other tech company in June well they decided to do a 10:1 stock split and to find out what that is I can just ask the Arya AI baked into the Opera browser explain to me a 10:1 stock split in two sentences with an example right so a 10 to1 stock split means that each existing share of a
stock is divided into 10 new shares and then it gives an example to say that if you owned 100 shares of a company and they did a 10 to1 stock split you would now have a th000 shares in your possession but the total value of your investment is the same because it's just that now each individual share is worth a tenth of what it used to be why does that matter well it means that for new investors Nvidia shares have just gotten 10 times more affordable so it makes investing in this company much more
accessible at a time where the entire world is looking for some way to invest in AI it became a no-brainer it was explosive as for now and the future while Nvidia has been hit with a pretty severe Market correction so they backed down into third most valuable company and while there are some question marks around AI like is it being over valued in the same way that the dotom bubble was and can the world sustain it cuz you know there was a recent study that showed that at the current rate of
growth our AI needs alone will consume the amount of power of an entire country the size of the Netherlands but even then now that the AI cat is out the bag it doesn't look like AI is going anywhere and even if it does there's no changing that the world is going digital movies are now being made using game engine Graphics surgeons are now honing their craft using digital twins of patients before operating on the real thing the metav if that ever comes to fruition it's all being powered by
Nvidia gpus so that's how Nvidia got to the crazy position that they're currently in and by the way Arya isn't even the most fun thing about the Opera browser anymore so you've seen how tab Islands can help you group together all of your tasks into buckets so they're organized but now you can hover over any Tab and add a tab Emoji too why well aside from a delightful Touch of customization I've had two benefits from this one that every time I have two similar tabs open this allows me to
differentiate them instead of persistently gaslighting myself into opening the wrong one every time but also when you're browsing you tend to have one or two key tabs like for me it's the document I'm compiling all of my research into and tab emojis mean that even if you've got like 40 things open at once I always know to return to my cooking Emoji so give it a go using my link in the description
