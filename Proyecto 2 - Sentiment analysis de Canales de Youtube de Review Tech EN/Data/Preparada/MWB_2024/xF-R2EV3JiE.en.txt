this gadget apparently allows you to smell your video game it's called The Game sent the box is basically saying that it adds the only missing senses to your gaming and Movie experience so it looks like this is a removable cap slot one is gunfire explosions racing cars Forest storm and then the last one is just called clean air scent this is going to actually connect in between the PS5 and the TV it's going to listen to the incoming audio track from whatever you're playing or watching and then it's
going to use AI to turn that sound into to an appropriate smell that it thinks matches it see what fortnite smells like oh wo motorbike am I going to smell burnt tires I'm definitely smelling something flamable you absolutely can smell it but I wouldn't say the scents match what I'm doing closely enough for it to feel like it's adding another layer to it it smells really nice you think it smells nice what you're smelling right now is gunfire explosions and a little bit of forest the concept
for this is so interesting if it was like the second I fired a gun I immediately smelt smoke this could be insane but it's not quite there
