"$1 Speaker versus $4,000 speaker" starting with a $1 speaker this is incredibly portable and it sounds like it's got one note and everything is just a slight variation of that it's one out of 10 for $10 then you can get something that's well nearly 10 times the size the sound is so much Fuller and you actually have base that's an easy five at 10 times that price you have JBL it does have a lot more features and waterproofing wo the base hits you like a truck this has to be a seven out of 10
but the $500 Sonos move is not just a better speaker it's got something called true play tuning which actually adjusts the sound based on the furniture you have around the sound quality is not actually a lot better than JBL it's just "basier here it's an eight this $4,000" dvla Phantom bow is in a world of its own it's got zero Distortion it has 108 DB of volume allowing it to hit you with base deeper than you've ever heard before 10 out of 10 subscribers
