this is not an editing trick this is a real hologram generator how basically a fan a fan with four blades Each of which is filled with a ton of micro LED rotating light as the blades move the LEDs change color at each micro degree of rotation and at just the right speed to effectively paint a 2K resolution image floating in the air so you can play any videos on this you can use it as a display for gaming you can even cast your phone's display directly onto it oh and also it's just a fan
