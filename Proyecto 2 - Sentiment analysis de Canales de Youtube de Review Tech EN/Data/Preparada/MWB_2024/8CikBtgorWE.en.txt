I just bought every generation of iPad ever so let's find out how the iPad was originally scrapped how Apple eventually made it but then completely ruined the marketing of it and then how they finally got it all together and crushed the competition now you know what's actually crazy about the first iPad that this was being worked on all the way back in 2004 and it's only while Apple were making the iPad that they realized hey wait a sec if we scale down this same Tech it could become an absolutely
revolutionary phone and as soon as they realized that they immediately suspended iPad development and went all in on what would end up becoming the iPhone in 2007 so if you think about it this is actually the product that Apple originally intended to make but it took till 2010 for them to eventually do so damn this thing's heavy so underneath the iPad is an insert with a full color quick start manuals and two Apple stickers can't even get one of those nowadays the 30 pin connector and a 10 wat power 
brick but there's still a massive question mark hanging over this thing cuz the market for tablets was frankly abysmal in 2010 the conventional wisdom was don't make one they never work there weren't any mainstream Android tablets out basically every tablet that existed at this time was just a big chunky ill-fated attempt at a new form of Windows PC which was basically just a laptop that had been sliced in half and given a stylus even Apple had their own Rocky history with the Newton PDA and
its poor handwriting recognition not to mention a canceled 1983 project called bashville which honestly it's probably for the best that this one didn't get made and so the question is what on Earth did Apple do with this tablet to actually change people's minds two things one that the iPhone at this point was selling extremely well so well that it was actually driving the price of components necessary for the iPad down meaning that Apple managed to release this as somehow one of the most
affordable tablets and you can tell Steve Jobs fully knew that when he announced that the thing was not going to be $999 but in fact $499 listen to that reaction wow and two but the way you could interact with the thing was revolutionary like I said practically every tablet at the time had a stylus to mimic the mouse pointer since they were all just Windows computers and so when Steve Jobs announced that they managed to scale up the iPhone's capacitive multi-touch interface to work on their
tablet and that all you needed was a finger I mean he probably could have just dropped the mic and walked off at that moment no more things this was such a New Concept that even though it seems so obvious now jobs actually needed to show people how to navigate this thing not to men this was the first time you could just rotate on iOS and switch over to landscape mode man using this thing takes me back so much I remember this being such a desirable Gadget and it's also a sign how much care they put into
the user interface that it still holds up today I would actually go as far as to say that it is still beautiful and even though the thing is not light just by being light enough that you can hold it in one hand intuitive to use and Powerful with the Apple A4 chip making it 3.4 times more powerful than the first iPhone Apple very quickly put tablets back on people's Radars the iPad sold over 15 million units in total before it was replaced which considering the state of the tablet Market at the
time makes this a breakout success leaving apple with no joke 85% of the tablet market and you know what I would actually go as far as to say that the iPad 2 just one year later was even more of a revelation cuz if the iPad 1 was an Apple tablet that nailed the fundamentals then the iPad 2 was a full modernization of those fundamentals all for that same $499 price for example it was thinner but I don't mean like phones today that might come out 0.2 mm thinner than the last one I
mean Apple went from 13.4 mm all the way to 8.8 in large part by replacing the original iPads 2 fatter batteries with three flatter batteries which also allow them to remove some of the internal plastic support framing it was the first iPad with cameras a front 0.3 map and a back 0.7 map and apple celebrated that with the launch of photo booth on iOS which no one was using as their main camera but there was definitely something fun about the fusion of the camera with the iPad's fun bite-sized
software oh my goodness me I remember this feeling like people's first taste at what you now get with the practically unlimited Snapchat filters to think there must have been a point where all of these Apple XX were sitting in a boardroom testing these features God iPad 2 had double the Ram at 512 MB and the new dual core A5 chip ended up making this about about 2.5 times faster than the original iPad so let me try and load up the same web page on both this was like the classic comparison everyone
wanted to see at the time let's go samsung.com 3 2 1 go what Safari cannot open the page cuz it could not establish a secure connection to the server what are they trying to say about Samsung apple.com 3 2 1 go oh oh oh oh oh well the iPad 2 has already started to load the page iPad one is still going still going there you go although neither can actually load the full page not to mention this is where Apple introduced smart covers automatically putting the iPad in sleep mode when
closed while cleaning the screen with their microfiber cloth backing this doesn't normally happen with SQL products but the iPad 2 was such a huge leap that this specifically became an icon even more so than the original so much so that this was still being sold up until 2014 as the entry-level iPad even outlasting the three and the four but it's with this third iPad that things start to get a little strange see logic would dictate that if your iPad sold well your iPad 2 sold Gang Busters
that all you have to do is to keep making the same kinds of improvements and to call it the iPad free what Apple actually did was call this new iPad the new iPad what this will never make sense to me how can any product ever be named the new something cuz what do they think happens when it's not new anymore hey I'm here to repair my new iPad I got the new iPad yeah well I mean I got it like 3 years ago you got the new iPad 3 years ago yep are you sure it's not the new old iPad well it's not you know the new
iPad but it is the new iPad if you get me I'm not paid enough for this the key new thing this time was after Apple saw the reaction to the retina display on their iPhone 4 they knew that they had to bring that Tech to the iPads 2o and it was an especially massive jump here because there was already a lot of pixels to start with this brought the iPad up to one of the highest resolution displays on the market full stop I mean just look at the difference in the Safari icon this kind of clarity would
have felt surreal in 2012 so that part of it was great it's just basically the rest of it like the A5 chip in the iPad 2 became the a5x in the iPad 3 which was frankly a tiny Improvement this iPad had the same amount of storage the same 30 pin connector I mean it looks identical it was the first iPad technically with support for LTE networks but even that was a problem despite advertising the iPad 3 as a 4G LTE device it actually couldn't communicate with LTE networks outside of the US due to the use of
different radio frequencies which led to Apple being sued across multiple countries and at the same time while Apple was starting to get comfortable the Android competition was starting to heat up up until this point yes there had been plenty of Android tablets but they were awfully optimized they were so buggy and laggy that they' actually created a bad reputation for Android tablets as just the knockoff alternative to iPad but Google was paying very close attention to the surprising take up of
the iPad and they invested very heavily around this time in creating a tablet optimized version of Android Android 3.0 honeycomb man it feels so good to talk about this again these honeycomb tablets were actually something I was covering in the very early days of this Channel and they were great you could find something at every price point they were way more customizable than Apple and since they were now running a software that was specifically designed for tablets they actually used the large
available screen space better plus by the time Android 4.0 rolled out Google was also starting to fix the single main thing holding Android back the lag which all put together meant that Apple's market share was tumbling fast all the way from 85% the year of the first iPad to 44% now and I think seeing all of this happen Apple started to get a little bitter they felt like they were the ones who started this whole smartphone and smart tablet thing and everyone else was just copying them
particularly Samsung so it's at this point that Apple decided to try and sue them they claimed that Samsung copied everything from the design to the screen icons and even core patented features like tap to zoom and bounceback which allows your screen to show the surface beneath a document the funny part of this though is that that failed because the High Court ruled that there was no way any consumer would ever confuse the two devices because Samsung was and I quote not as cool so I mean no one
really wins here but this ended up being just the beginning of what would become the absolutely brutal 7-year suing and counter doing Conquest between these two companies and the waters only got muddier later that same year because it wasn't just full-size Android tablets that were starting to become popular it was smaller 7in ones too because remember most phone screens at this time were still only like 4 in now Steve Jobs had historically hated this idea he believed that users needed the iPad's
larger 9.7 in screen to actually do anything useful but there was another Apple exac Eddie Q who had been pushing for a 7-in iPad since 2011 through internal emails and eventually he won job over I think it's so fascinating to see how Apple was thinking at the time look at this subject why I just dumped the iPad hint Size Matters having used a Samsung Galaxy I agree with many of the comments below I believe there will be a 7-in market and we should do one and so alongside the next generation iPad 4
which yes came out the same year as the iPad 3 sorry new iPad Apple also released the iPad mini and to be completely honest I don't think it was  Apple had clearly decided that the kind of user who'd be looking for a mini tablet wasn't someone who would care about The Cutting Edge so the iPad Mini is basically just a tiny iPad 2 in terms of specs and it came out at $329 the cool part though is that yes even though this was just an iPad 2 on the inside the thinner display technology available now and the new
unibody outer shell which had fewer Parts meant that instead of the iPad Mini being thicker than the iPad 2 like you would expect given that it's shorter and narrower it's actually thinner too this this thing is just 7.2 mm thin much thinner than Apple's competitors at the time like the Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Fire HD the former being arguably the first major Android tablet success story and for the market they were targeting this was absolutely the right thing to focus on it meant that this
technically inferior iPad Mini actually far outsold the iPad 4 that it released alongside supply chain numbers suggest Apple was restocking this thing at two times the rate which you could sort of see coming from the most M the iPad Mini was first unveiled on stage oh yeah this is also where Apple introduced the lightning port to the iPad which in one sense felt like the future it could support higher transfer speeds faster charging it was way neater and less bulky and unlike the industry
standard micro USB at the time completely reversible but on the other hand users and reviewers weren't completely jazzed that apple had gone from one self-made proprietary cable straight to another making the old cable Obsolete and requiring a whole new set of accessories oh unless you pick up the $30 adapter but the fourth gen fullsize iPad was still the true Flagship of 2012 and since Apple attributed a lot of the iPad success so far to its pricing they kept it again for the fourth year in a row this was
$499 even though when you factor in inflation that's actually about 20% cheaper than the first model also a  itself which actually sparked quite a bit of drama from people who just bought the previous gen only to have this thing drop 7 months later feels particularly cruel given the naming on that iPad this was a massive chipset upgrade from the a5x to the a6x which made this about 2 and 1/2 times more powerful than the iPad 3 and so about 6.5 times more powerful than the original iPad but
apart from that and upgrading the front camera from 0.3 to 1.2 map there is basically nothing new it's literally iPad 3 maybe they should have just called this the newer iPad do you know what they actually called it iPad 4 was officially sold under the name iPad with retina display even though they just previously released the iPad with retina display so you took the old feature from the new iPad that's really now the old iPad and used it to name the actually new iPad Apple what are you doing I
think it's pretty clear that Apple themselves were confused with what to do with iPad you could tell that all of this was not one person calling the shots but a divided boardroom and if anything reinforces that idea is the fact that the following year instead of a fifth generation iPad Apple instead released yet another new category the  Air I remember seeing this thing get announced on stage apple called this the biggest step yet in achieving the vision of the iPad and the crowd seemed pretty
happy about it now obviously to invent a whole new name for this iPad it must be a lot thinner and lighter right well yes actually the very first iPad was 680 G the most recent iPad 4 was 652 G the iPad Air was just 469 and making that much of a change to what was already a very optimized design that requires a lot of work Apple had to eliminate the air gap between the front glass and the LCD panel which also at the same time improves the picture quality the aluminium frame was Slimmer
and these smaller size bezels they were not just an aesthetic win but also meant that you need less material but the thing that made the most difference Apple Shrunk The Battery by a good 30% but still managed to keep the same end battery life through a pretty massive leap in efficiency with their new A7 chip that also happened to double the performance of the last iPad these numbers are really really impressive and so even though this might look just like an upsized iPad Mini it's the power and
The Branding of iPad Air that I think was a big part of the thing success I think air just makes it feel very clearly new you felt like you were buying something that was distinctly impossible the last year but I think the most interesting part of this is that the iPad Air launched with iOS 7 the first ever major iOS redesign and on one hand this just feels right Apple's lightest iPad releasing alongside their lightest feeling software iOS 7 got rid of all complicated 3D shapes and
replaced them with nearly shadowless flat icons thinner text and pler backgrounds I remember my friends showing me the new iOS in the playground and it distinctly feeling like the future this flat design was what the entire industry was moving towards at the time but when I look back I also can't help but feel like the original iOS icons had so much more charm iOS 7 also does feel a bit characterless by comparison but this is where things get taken up another notch because in all
this time making iPads there's one thing that Apple hadn't tried yet we've had iPad but small we've had iPad but thin and in 2015 Apple decided it was time for iPad but big and not just in size this is the absolutely ginormous iPad Pro the Big Daddy of iPads I could not for the life of me find one of these Brand New by the way so this one is used but barely now credit wear credits due I I actually think it's pretty great that Apple managed to at first release the iPad at $499 and then keep hitting that
price year after year while making the product significantly better that said Pro is where the company makes up for that lost ground with a starting price of $799 so this needs to be a massive Improvement and well you got a new chip the a9x which is a very healthy 1.9x improvement over the previous a8x that Apple used in the iPad Air 2 and an enormous 3.4x jumper over the A7 in the original iPad Air at the same time if the iPad Airs are getting these super high performance X Series chips then
what's actually Pro about the iPad Pro well it's massive this 12.9 in display is practically laptop sized we now have a quad speaker setup which actually let's do a quick demo so this is the iPad Air it's actually pretty good although highly directional considering that the speakers both face downwards and then with the iPad Pro we move from two to four speakers and they are all around the device it's not that much louder but it's way more immersive there's a camera upgrade to 8 mapel which I'm sure is
exactly what the pros were pining for and the introduction of this the apple pencil which is particularly interesting because styluses are something that Steve Jobs used to hate you have to get them and put them away and you lose them yuck plus does it not feel like the entire existence of the iPad Pro was something Steve Jobs would have questioned the way that he saw the the world was big old PC computers were like trucks there'd always be some people who need them but that's a minority the
majority of people will use cars and in this analogy job saw the iPad is the car and so in a way this iPad Pro makes a lot of sense of course you'll have some people who don't want a truck but do want a more Super top Pro car but then isn't that what the MacBook is for and you're about to see the relationship between these two products get more and more murky also I find this so cool let's say you're finding your existing wallpaper a little bit too bland if I pull up the Opera browser our sponsor
make me an iPad wallpaper in this style but more colorful and Boulder see what it spits out wa and Bam it looks like a really nice evolution of the original and Opera just got an update too which now gives you a movable music player dynamic themes which go absolutely crazy and are fully customizable but also they have basically fixed the hassle of manually resizing Windows while trying to multitask with split screen not to mention I'm a big believer in the whole clear room clear mind philosophy I don't
work well with mess around me and that's a big part of why I gravitate towards Opera because tab Islands let you stay completely organized and therefore very much in the zone even if your room isn't link below to download the Opera browser for free now Apple did release a pro second generation in 2017 but it was a pretty unexciting incremental upgrade it's only in 2018 when things got really interesting this is the iPad Pro third gen now at $999 and the way the Apple Justified the second major price hike is
that this was a complete redesign and you can tell gone are the Uber minimalist boxes of old the new iPad was all about color this is where Apple decided that the kinds of people that the pro iPad should appeal to were creatives so they really leaned into that you got the iPad the insert does still have the same stuff in it as the very first model but you can tell they've really neatened up the presentation of everything there's now a USBC cable which I'm getting to and the
iPad itself which has not just a new design but equally exciting a new matte packaging extra crispy now I have to say I noticed a change in apple around this time partly I think because iPad market share was falling hitting just 24% in 2015 because of more competition from Samsung and Lenovo and iPhones now being offered in larger fablet sizes and partly because this is where Apple's mobile a series chipsets started to get really fast put these two things together and this is where you notice
Apple starting to go straight for the computer users right from the very launch event of the iPad Pro 3 they touted how the new a2x bionic processor was faster than 92% of portable PCS with overall system performance 2.8 times faster than the Gen 1 iPad Pro making it around 124 times faster than the very first iPad and 421 times faster than the first iPhone not to mention this was the first iPad with a USBC port and the EU didn't even need to tell them to do it this was clearly part of the new Apple
strategy where the iPad was pitched as a great alternative to a Windows computer with this port allowing it to be hooked up to a 5k resolution monitor as well as giving it compatibility with a whole bunch of pro accessories the storage capacity was now up to 1 tbte this is the first iPad with face ID so out with the home button we got a 120 HZ promotion display and also just generally this is just such a nice neatening and sharpening up of the way the iPad looks it feels way more
intentional now but the main reason this iPad was such big news for me a massive reduction and just as important evening of the bezels around the screen this moved the iPad from tablet to Magic sheet of glass as Apple calls it cuz you can use it just as easily from every angle and you know what this new Windows laptop targeting strategy was actually kind of working Apple's market share started to pick up once again so they kept doubling down on this Mantra with  20120 your next computer is not a
computer they said it came with massively upgraded cameras a new liar sensor which in hindsight was quite a few years too early to be of much use to any consumer and then the a12z bionic chipset God Apple please stick to one naming convention I'm begging you and it made basically no difference to Performance one pretty large development was the new magic keyboard you could get with it which also included a trackpad you sure it's not a computer Tim but this was especially strange since the
selfie camera which you'd be using for calls was still on the top Edge which made no sense since Apple were clearly trying to push you to use the device horizontally the biggest change though between the last iPad and this one is the iPad's second big software overhaul iPad OS it's hard to believe but up until this point every iPad was just running the same iOS that iPhones were running but in order to Target their appeal to computer users Apple had to convince them that they were getting
more than just what their phones already could do so iPad OS launched with a redesigned home screen that could fit more apps long overdue but it did fix the frankly ridiculous looking spacing that iPads had up until this point there's new widgets Safari would now also automatically give you the desktop version of sites scaled for the iPad display and optimized for touch it wasn't immediately a massive change but it needed to happen eventually since the way people use their phones is very
different to the way they use their Tablets before long Apple's market share was back up to 38% helped imp part thanks to a growing middle class in Emerging Markets who could actually afford their premium product at which point Apple decided you know what it's time for another price hike "$1,099 was what the 2021 iPad Pro fifth" gen launched at and to well and truly solidify that not a computer but basically a computer was the direction that Apple wanted to go in this time
around Apple actually managed to squeeze in the M1 laptop grade chip inside of  iPad the entire history of iPads thus far have been powered by a series chips the same series of chips that go into your phone but as the latest attempt to try and get get away from the reputation of the iPad just being a Netflix machine this time they tried to focus on giving you something different under the hood now in a way this is all a little arbitrary the M series chips are based on the same architecture as the a series
chips they're just beefed up but then that's like any other normal chip upgrade would be anyways this iPad is about 1.5 times faster than the last gen but still considering that Apple's tablets were already at this point far more powerful than most Android competition sticking another 50% onto that lead is still kind of a lot that said cool as it is to have an M1 chip and the now up to 16 GB of RAM and 2 terab of storage this Behemoth of a tablet can come with I don't know who
exactly was using it to its limit on an iPad given that the base software is still not that far off iph software to return to the Steve Jobs analogy this combination of Chip and product is a bit like taking the engine of a truck and sticking it into a car the car still can't go above the speed limit and it's never going to need to carry more than five people because they won't fit inside it anyway one thing that everyone could appreciate though is this new screen in one Fell Swoop it was goodbye
to the IPS LCD panels of old hello mini LED liquid retina xdr God Apple can you just please name things in plain English but this basically means that instead of one big backlight this display has thousands of mini LEDs each with their own backlight allowing for way higher Peak brightness also big upgrade to the the front-facing camera it's now a 12 megapix Ultra wide specifically to allow for a new Apple feature called center stage where the camera can follow you around the room I wish the camera could
literally follow me to the correct side of the device though the 2022 iPads were when Apple started to Eco up their packaging so you'll notice no outside plastic wrap that's part of the fun gone but you can tell they have still obsessed over how to still give this thing that fresh new product feeling we got the same insert the same power brick Oh but now the USBC cable is braided which is an important Improvement for durability and Tangle resistance something the original Apple cables were pretty notorious
for got to say they have done a pretty slick job swapping out the plastic for fiber while still retaining that crispy fresh iPad feeling now aside from one admittedly cool upgrade to the apple pencil which now shows a Digital Shadow above your screen when you hover this iPad basically just existed for people who like to say that my iPad has more M's than yours it had an M2 Chip instead of an M1 making it 1.2 times more powerful but you know what as strange as Apple's product strategy is starting to
feel with their quest to take on Windows laptops actually just making them feel more and more like MacBooks each year the market share has just kept climbing with the iPad Pro becoming Apple's bestselling iPad and apple ending 2022 with 46% of the market the way that I think Apple's looking at this is yes every time we give the iPad a new Pro feature we are slightly cannibalizing the MacBook but at the same time we're making the iPad less pointless and I think the way Apple sees it the iPad has
a way better chance than the MacBook of becoming the bestselling mainstream computer but the Seventh Generation really feels like the crowning Jewel of the iPad line and it's at this point where they've fully given the iPad packaging the iPhone treatment it's far thinner inside you got the iPad surprisingly similar layout internally it's just now you get no power brick I do like this though a black braided cable to match the black iPad color I've  and let's be very clear I think this
device is bordering on a miracle to be honest it is 5.1 mm thick for starters just look at this versus the original iPad the difference is phenomenal and like I said earlier I'm not as fuss when it comes to the thickness of a phone but on a 13-in tablet where it's the difference between being comfortable with two hands and being comfortable to use with just one hand it matters it's got a tandem OLED display display which means that instead of just one layer of backlit lighting this screen now has two
stacked on top of each other so the brightness is unexpectedly High amusingly Apple actually downgraded the cameras and they kind of tried to hide it as you can see cuz the ultra wide camera was here and it just swapped it for the lar sensor which was previously here but they have finally fixed the front camera by sticking it on the landscape side not to mention the new Apple pencil Pro which now lets you squeeze to bring up new tools and Barrel Roll to rotate the part of the nib
you're drawing with it really does feel like apple bottled up two generations worth of upgrades into one here which reminds me it's kind of crazy how far the iPad has come from Steve Jobs's original Vision both in ways that would have amazed him how the thing practically started off as a portable email machine and now it's a almost do whatever you want machine but maybe also appalled by with all this apple pencil stuff and to be fair his original complaint of you needing a place to put
the pencil still holds true cuz the thing does just fall off when you rattle it oh yeah and if you liked being able to brag about the number two before oh boy you must have been very excited when they announced that these iPads somehow got the M4 chip before the MacBooks this is stupidly powerful for its diminutive thickness a further 1.5x more powerful than the previous Pro 345 times more powerful than the iPad 1 and astonishingly about "1,170 times more powerful than the"
original iPhone but I have covered this in a separate video in detail if you want to see that so yeah this has been an absolute monster of a video to put together especially with all this new house stuff going on like this is the fourth first gen iPad that we've had to buy to actually get one that works so hope you liked it and I will catch you in the next one oh yeah and before the comments this is not the next gen Mr who's the boss Studio this is a cinema room
