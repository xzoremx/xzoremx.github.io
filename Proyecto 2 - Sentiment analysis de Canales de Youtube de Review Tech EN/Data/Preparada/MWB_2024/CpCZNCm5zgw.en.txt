this is the greatest iPhone in the world has ever seen we've been working on it for over a year now while we've been racing to overtake apple and subscribers and now that we've just passed them it's time to show the  1 there you go this thing is built from scratch it's the actual super Compu of smartphones and there are seven things it can do that will make your current phone look like a toy like for example  so this is no normal phone camera oh actually I just remembered we have appe
peel to do world's largest phone peel in   that I can't reach behind this glass is actually a fullframe Canon EOS R5 we're talking a camera that shoots very good full quality 8K resolution video yeah why don't we start a cost tally too that'll be fun so that one camera has cost us "$35,000 and I'm not going to get too" technical here but just to give you an idea the best indicator of a camera's quality is it sensor size that's why pretty much every other year smartphone companies increase the size of their
sensors by 10 to 15% this camera sensor "is over 1,000% larger than that of the" latest Pro iPhones your move Tim wow so time to put it to the test ah the Apple store London mine's bigger so this is the camera app and because the actual camera itself is locked away on the inside what we've had to do here is to get a sim and a very real data plan so that we can use Canon's Wi-Fi link app to have a live feed of what the camera is seeing in real time all right let's go oh this feels good I mean just look
at the difference in detail the warmth of the colors and just how cinematic our camera looks in comparison also if you're curious about the video quality I don't think I've ever looked this pretty before and because this is an 8K resolution recording we' have absolutely smoked the Apple iPhone in terms of detail also if you're wondering why there's a single Macho pluster on my face it's because I walked straight into a pole while heing this Beast of a phone around London but every topend
smartphone also has a zoom camera and of course we need to top that as well if you see me shaking at all during this video by the way it's because I'm very nervous the Guinness World Record adjudicator is on her way right now and if she likes what she sees we will actually walk away today with a Guinness World Record yeah let's hope so there's a lot at stake here okay so here's the thing with zoom to create more zoom you have to create more distance between your camera sensor and the glass in your
lens so if we just plopped a second zoom camera right next to our main camera facing outwards like this then the maximum amount of optical zoom we could achieve in that depth is about seven times now seven times optical zoom that's all already pretty good the latest Pro iPhones come with five times optical zoom and that's about as high as phones get but we don't want to just match the iPhone we want to far surpass it we we want to beat every future possible generation of iPhones so this
second zoom camera which is the Sony rx10 Mark I by the way isn't actually sitting here firing outwards it's sitting here firing vertically up the phot with a mirror to then reflect that view outwards which allows us to create the maximum possible distance between the sensor and the glass and this isn't just any mirror normal mirrors have either glass or plastic in front of the reflective surface but this one has the reflective surface on the front side making for zero degradation to image
quality what does that mean for optical zoom 25 times and if you're happy to use digital Zoom then you can go up to 100 times and still get a clear photo if you run to that corner over there I'm going to see if I can find you oh yeah and you know the other benefit of having a mirror Periscope system like this is it's adjustable I hold down one button on this remote and this mirror micro adjusts its angle which means we can change where we're shooting without even moving the phone right so we're going to
zoom in to drisha using an iPhone 3 2 1 image image so 25 times is the maximum amount of digital zoom and now on the big iPhone we can't see her very well the feed quality isn't the best but zoom and zoom and zoom there she is let's capture oh my goodness look at that I probably don't need to explain explain why ours is better so what is powering this phone well you might know that Apple themselves have a very closed controlled way of making products which means that the only way to actually run iOS is to
buy an iPhone you can't run iOS on any other device so this is actually running Android with many many different applications and skins to make it look as close to IOS as possible but that's not a quirk that's a feature yeah because Android is so much more open what it's allowed us to do is to basically build a very high-end PC on the inside to power it and that took a lot of trial and error we even tried the latest Nvidia RTX 1490 but no luck we had to do a lot of experimentation for
the correct Hardware configuration for this just to give you some perspective the absolute best iPhones have 8 GB of RAM and a tiny little mobile ship our iPhone has 128 GB of RAM it has the AMD 6950 XT dedicated graphics card and a 24 core Intel Core I9 processor it's pretty insane making this possibly the most powerful Android device in the world but it can do something that an iPhone just can't do yeah so most topend phones nowadays they start out at around 256 GB of internal storage and they max out at
1 tab this has 4 terab of space and what we've done with that 4 terabytes is to create a partition meaning that we've allocated 2 terab to run Android with more storage than than any Android phone ever but then the other two terabytes to run Windows so every time you boot the thing up you just decide which of these two operating systems that you want to boot into which means yes this thing can basically do everything oh yeah and there's also two water cooling systems inside this phone one for the processor
which is kind of what you might expect one of them is for something you probably won't but we're getting there so we are in the very heart of London people are starting to gather around I feel like a street performer but I think I think what everyone is here to see is a benchmark okay so 3D mark this is the extreme stress test it's going to be quite tough I'm going to go Wildlife extreme guys so I'm loading up the same Benchmark on both phones go oh the crowd is going wild
wow 230 frames per second oh my goodness me iPhone 15 Pro Max Ultra it just works  38559 10 times 10 times okay so that's all well and good but let's see what we can do with that power what's the max setting we can put it on right while we wait for that to load just so you know by the way I have no way of exactly measuring it but this iPhone weighs between 150 and 200 kg in part thanks to real brushed aluminium all the way around hence the stamp which to support something that
heavy also weighs another 100 kg so don't drop this thing on your face in bed but also I cannot state to you just how much work has gone into moving this thing around like I had to call every available person I knew to spend 3 hours just getting it into our house and then a full-on professional crew of six massive dudes to help get it out again to go to London every time you change orientation where do you store something like this overnight how do you get it onto a pavement you have to think of
everything and the immense weight of the thing is also why there's room for eight detachable handles for eight people to carry it this is pretty much every setting on Cyber Punk set to maximum this doesn't feel real I feel like I'm in some sort of weird lucid dream and I feel like everyone right now is watching my absolutely embarrassing gameplay in public but now it was time to show London the final boss of video games it's going to be a world record in two ways oh my God oh my God high
score this is genuinely my best performance yet I'm really happy that it's happening here you thought it was a screen recording right thank you thank you a that was my score for a really long time and there nothing there's nothing to be ashamed of wow this is insane right come on you got it you got it wow okay you're high okay this is the best attempt so far apart from mine I think 12 is really hard oh don't to kick the table up oh my  my oh and the other benefit of having a
phone the size of like two human beings is your selfie camera can see like the entire Street let's try and get the biggest selfie ever taken come on three two one okay nice let's have a look what some light social media looks like ah friction burnt I've actually burnt my finger there's a oh man okay yeah I wasn't kidding this is what my finger looked like the next day genuinely though if you were going to endlessly browse social media this is a healthier way of doing it you're standing you're moving it's
interactive a bit of friction introduces a bit of friction now for your favorite bit this guy's a massive speaker head and so when it came to the speakers on this phone he has basically taken it upon himself to build a custom one-of aind set of speakers for this yeah it needs to be as good as is possible so it's got a transmission line subwofer system which means that it gets the most out of the space for deep and Powerful BAS there's tubes inside that literally delay sound
waves so that they come out of the phone louder for reference the speakers on an iPhone which are already some of the loudest most powerful speakers that you can get on a smartphone these things operate up to around 3 watts of max power this has 50 WS per speaker unit there are eight units in total including four subwoofer drivers purely for BAS oh yeah the buttons the buttons by the way they feel absolutely giant which feels like an obvious thing to say given the scale of them but it's actually
thanks to a very specific engineering decision yeah behind each button is a Pneumatic cylinder these limit the speed at which the buttons can operate giving them a sense of scale or in other words cunk yeah and it's super satisfying but the key thing we wanted to test here is speakers so let's see what a video call looks like on our phone um so the idea is we're currently calling you on a normal iPhone 15 Pro I'm going to step back we're just going to see how far away this call starts to become a
problem okay so this is probably 2 m is this about the point where it disintegrates this is the point where your foot starts to look like it's about this long why why do I have big feet just the Distortion at the edge of the lens oh the okay so at about this distance your face is starting to become dots to me um I mean can you even hear me I'm starting to make out about 85% of the words you're giving me it's your noise cancellation isn't sure what's you and what's Noise Okay that's actually
spot on the feedback we wanted did you say you use a Galaxy Note 9 as your phone yeah it's um it's in great condition this has got to be this is some sort of joke there's got to be a reason Beyond that's the phone you like oh there's a new packet it this morning I dropped it off the side of my bed this morning it's Art's he's doing an art thing it's got to be I just really hate switching phones I'm going to call you on the biggest iPhone now I feel Paul for the first time in my life like does
it like work work it works it works it's trusted yeah it's literally a giant phone screen blown up so what about here I assume you can still see us I mean yeah sure you guys are you guys look small let's go stupidly far back you can hear me you can see me the sound is very good okay well thank you I love the fact that the camera is mounted so high it's very clear as soon as you jump on the core with someone they are like towering above you I know yeah yeah how much does this thing weigh hold on let me guess
let me guess I'm going to say 1110 kilos not a bad guess times it by three so just to establish we can have a fullon conversation video call from here which is like 30 m away from the phone great easy all right take care guys you have a great evening and congrats on all the hard work this seems like it was a incredible undertaking congratulations you guys thank you bye bye lonus now this this screen right here is one of the things that we are most proud of what we could have done and what we
probably should have done in hindsight cuz it would have been a thousand times easier is just bought one of the already readily available touchscreen LCD TVs but we didn't want to do that basically every top end phone nowadays uses an OLED display it uses that because it has infinitely better contrast than LCD it has infinitely better viewing angles like the only reason you can actually see the screen from where you are is because we use this we basically decided that if we're building the best we need
to use the best so we found an 8K 888 in OLED TV from LG it looked absolutely beautiful in person so we covered our eyes and we clicked that purchase button because this screen alone retails for "$25,000 and since it doesn't actually" exist as a touchscreen we had to turn it into one and that that was a pain in the bum Yeah we actually broke one of these TVs during this process it's just so difficult because what we have to do is optically laminate a T layer onto the TV and it's necessary to use some highly
specialized Optical glue for this so that it retains the OLED image quality yeah and the optical glue was only available in like 50 ml bottles yeah we basically bought the UK's entire supply of this glue there you cannot buy it right now because we' bought them out so sorry phone repair people the first TV actually broke because of this glue it's extremely runny and there was a tiny Gap all the way around the TV which it flowed in to and onto some circuitry completely destroying it we got a 600
a.m. distress call from that I think he broken down basically things were not going to plant it was literally the worst thing that could have possibly happened but we've got through it we've got a perfectly working one now and uh honestly this is pretty remarkable because you wouldn't usually see this outside of a factory setting no one else would be stupid enough to make one so stupid yeah exactly do not try this at home this might actually be the only 88 in touchcreen OLED in the country very
possibly in the world this is bespoke yeah oh and also we couldn't forget this introducing Dynamic continent it's just like Dynamic Island but it  okay um anyway to keep the whole thing powered for context a pro level iPhone has between a 13 and a 17w hour battery what we have is two Anor solic  batteries these ones so yes when one runs out you can replace it immediately replaceable batteries don't you love to see it and I love this we have technically built our own port to be
able to power the thing because I mean a normal USBC wouldn't be close to enough power and a kettle cable on its own which is what is powering it it would just look a bit silly so welcome to USBC Pro Max Ultra as well why not pro Maximus it's even magnetized so that it doesn't fall out take that Apple technically we just brought mag safe to the charging port of an iPhone before Apple did yeah think yeah I think it's pretty safe to say that yeah yeah yeah cool yeah so do you remember I was
telling you that there's one more camera feature we wanted to talk about it's this an Apple iPhone flash module sits in the power range of 0.5 to 2 Watts we have managed to build in a 400 watt light source plus it's got a lens to focus the light and throw it even further 400 WS is so much power concentrated into a very small space that is also why we need the second water cooling system by the way okay let's test it starting with a normal iPhone how illuminated am I not very
I'll be honest you're like lit but like a candle yeah it feels like we're having like a romantic dinner right now so do you want to see the uh giant iPhones flashlight are you going to Blind Me Maybe right 3 2  1 like  really I feel like someone's used like a like a Dragon Ball Z move on me that's phenomenal that could light our videos yes it very well could it's a toasty thing my God it's like a radiator features you didn't know you wanted on your phone and now the final thing
before these Guinness World Records people come how well can this 88 in supercomputer high-end photography high-i phone actually do in your daily tasks so we need to see if I can use it to buy stuff we need to find out if we can make a payment with this thing so thankfully there is an ice cream stop right in front of us and I could kind of do with one right now okay guys pivot pivot let's go for one scoop of brownie ice cream please thank you very much oh sorry sorry would you mind um touching
about here do I have to come I can do it all right okay we haven't tested this  £360 if I just go slowly enough we'll eventually come across it take I heard something yeah no it's mine a oh you  it yes it worked it worked yes yes congratulations made a payment like now might be a pretty good time to email Mr Tim Apple himself Tim Cook at Apple do oh God someone's got to be monitoring that inbox huge update sent from my mahive iPhone perfect okay I'm just going to send it but okay just give me a
sec right Tim if you're watching watching this or reading this I would like a good morning back right we need to see if I can use it to watch TV before bed every night before I sleep I throw a show onto my   it and I love you oh my God it's like a home Cinema that's it I think the new setup quality is absolutely insane I can see every pour on people's skin I need to see if I can set an alarm for tomorrow well that seems like a reasonable time good night so that is what our iPhone can do
the only thing left now is to see if it's good enough to win an official world record hello hey meet nice to meet you record and this looks like a massive I it does and I'll be looking at things like are all the exterior buttons working the touchscreen navigation the touchscreen keyboard all these usual functions that you typically see with your average smartphone okay okay the record is determined by the length of this item but I also need to confirm that it is a scaled version of the
actual dimensions of an iPhone is already getting to work on confirming that it is a 15 times scaled up version of the original I'm getting really nervous she keeps talking about ratios I didn't quite expect just how seriously these guys take their measurements it has to be spoton I'm scared it has to work it has to work thanks for coming I know social media is very large your memes are 8K there's a oh my God this is crazy what okay hey Showtime let's start with the exterior buttons so this is the
lock button so as it would be on an iPhone that locks it brilant they require power but that's for a reason to make them feel giant so what you're doing there is changing the volume and that top button is an action button so the L iPhones allow you to configure it to do one action you want like turning on the flashlight which is what we've done so that is our flashlight which is a 400 W torch basically looking good we're after a good start let's look at some touch screen navigation Instagram
for example let's tap that this is our page I know it looks like I'm holding it together at this point but I was on breaking point I was so scared that in the moment something she wanted to see would just not work and that would be it well this record of course it must be based on a commercially available phone it is a brilliant scaled up version the demonstration of everything you've just shown me has gone very smoothly so I can confirm that what you have achieved today is in fact a new Guinness World
Record oh my God did it thank you go the excitement is Justified you have achieved the largest smartphone replica at 2.54 M it's very impressive very slick made to a high standard so it gives me great pleasure to present you with this official certificate congratulations you're officially amazing that is incredible guys well done well done we thank you thank you so much okay have a look at the video on DIY perks his channel for him building the thing as well as many other things like it and I
just want to say it feels like the start of a new era for the Mysteries the boss Channel there's a new theme song for starters but also just generally a lot of things that we've been working on in the background that we can finally start to talk about so it's going to be a good time I'll catch you in the next one yes we did it
