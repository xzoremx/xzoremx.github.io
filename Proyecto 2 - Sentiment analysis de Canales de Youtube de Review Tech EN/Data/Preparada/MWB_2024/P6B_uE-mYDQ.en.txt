The robor Rock qo slim is by far the most intelligent robot vacuum cleaner I've ever seen partly because it's better at cleaning the thing's got an extendable side brush and mop to get into hard to reach Corners it's got dual rubber brushes underneath tested for 99% hair pickup on hard to clean carpets and the thing self cleans its mop and empties its own dust bin at its dock by itself but the craziest bit is that it now uses 3D depth sensors that can sample 21 times faster than normal robot
vacuums a whole array of sensors to capture precise outlines of the objects around it and even a full-on RGB camera for visual recognition which means that when you set this thing off to go it will actually weave its way around not just the walls and the key features even the little things it will actually be able to see that there is a clump of wires here on the floor it will clean around them getting as close as it can without getting tangled in them and then it will even mark them on its map of the
room so that you can see the bits that you need to pick up and it does all of this while being one of the slimmest robots on the market which means that it can fit underneath basically anything
