these shoes are completely indestructible apparently wow they actually look surprisingly like normal shoes first up the fire test so I bought these fake realistic feet to see how much damage these shoes can actually protect you from and then we're going to use one in a normal pair of shoes to see the difference oh my God that is absolutely wild and it's not just burnt it is actually on fire all right now let's try on the indestructible shoe I can see some darkening on the shoelaces
they've lost their outside coating the shoe is definitely charred but it's not catching fire okay I think we need to very quickly move over to our water test and obviously this shoe is not waterproof either what about this one we'll see at the end if the foot on this one is still dry this is the puncture test oh let's try the same thing here the sole is incredibly bouncy it goes in a little bit but it will not go any further than this which is probably thanks to the layer of military grade
Kevlar sitting just above the sole so foot number one to think that could be a real foot now foot number two is dry not burned at all and puncture free
