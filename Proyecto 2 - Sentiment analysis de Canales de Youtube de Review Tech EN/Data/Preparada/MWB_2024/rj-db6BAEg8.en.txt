this is a smartphone and these are the craziest most powerful smartphone gadgets and we're going to combine all of their powers to build the most upgraded phone you have ever seen with superpowers starting with a $5 phone umbrella for when you want to keep your phone dry but not your own body so it sticks to the back of your phone via suction cup and then let's say it starts tipping it down okay stop stop the phone is in bone dry 6 out of 10 it does actually do its job however
dumb that job may be the amaran go is definitely a step up though this thing has literally just come out it's $29 and it actually looks amazing so it's got a magnet at the back which you snap onto the back of your phone and that is locked in and then even if you're not on an iPhone it comes with this sticky ring so that you can attach it onto any phone or actually anything and then this turns it on that is a massive Improvement to a phone's torch cuz it's not just about
sheer brightness it's the fact that the light is spread across a bigger area and that it's got this softening diffusion layer over it which all means if I was lighting myself with my normal phone torch I'd look like this I'd have a ton of harsh lines across my face which would add up to make me look pretty UNH handsome but then this this is literally a world aart it's so much softer it doesn't make me look like a Disney villain but then this is the magic trick the light flips up to both use that
light while you're taking selfies but also to use the LED mirror on the back to well first spot the cat fluff in your hair but this actually makes such a difference that I want to use this for every single Instagram story I take from now on you've got brightness control over here you've got color temperature control over here the only thing that feels like it might be a touch lacking is the battery I mean at the rate this thing is depleting I think we're talking less than an hour of juice still though
feels like a 9 out of 10 Gadget to me very well thought out so next up is the phone toaster I'm kidding it's actually a cleaning station but it's pretty fascinating how it works so first let take a swab of my phone before any cleaning lowkey going to expose myself here I do remember reading though that your phone does hold up to 10 times more bacteria than a toilet seat so it's not going to be good so now we place that sample on the aard jelly and if there's significant bacteria on my phone this is
going to look pretty gross pretty quickly so now we can load the phone in that is damn cool and it actually even works when the phone has a case on it and then on the inside are 30 of the most powerful form of ultraviolet LEDs firing within an aluminium chamber to get full sanitizing coverage I get some  on so swab number two I'll do the same thing yeah let's get it all up there and so now that AAR is fully impregnated so we'll come back to these samples at the end to see if this is a scam or a savior
so now at $80 we've got the mag safe suction cup so this is from a company called evolved and when we bought it from their site it definitely does say that the retail price is $80 but looking at what we actually received it's not immediately clear to me how so the concept is simple you use the suction pad at the back to stick one on your bathroom mirror you could stick one in the kitchen you could stick one right opposite the toilet so at this point we are $240 down but then there's a magma here
which means that without adding anything to your iPhone you could just snap it in place and it will hold there I will give it this the suction is a lot more powerful than it originally seems because this is actually a pressure trigger when you press this Mount against a wall the trigger detects it and then the mount sucks out the air through this hole here to create something that pretty closely resembles a vacuum seal so yes to do that this thing also has to have a very tiny
battery inside of it this is almost definitely the most secure method I've seen to mount a phone onto a wall with the extra perk of if you decided you wanted to charge your phone while it's on one of these USBC into here and then bam well it works it's actually really good it just can't be $80 for this oh okay I know what's happened here you know as soon as you see like 30 backtack five-star reviews from people who don't seem to have a second name yeah this is a Drop Shipping site which means the
actual product must be from AliExpress mag saafe suction and oh there it is so this is a $7 product for $7 actually to be fair I'd go as far as to say $9 out of 10 for $80 I'd probably say four we're already at a stage where we need this phone cage just to support all of these gadgets but now is where these gadgets start to get really serious cuz this is the shift cam snap grip Creator kit try say that 10 times so this is around $150 and it's designed to be everything you could want for your
phone's camera so this is the snap pod and then below that in this tell me this doesn't look at least a t tiny bit sus pouch we've got the snap grip which is the central product and that's attached to the snap light now that is a camera control Apple I mean it's far from Slimline but if the goal is to make your phone feel like a DSLR camera then that it does oh works as a phone stand too it's pretty cool but if that's where it ended then I would say fun idea novelty Gadget I wouldn't use this where I think
this gets interesting is that this snap grip actually uses this EXT ra space that it's taking up for a battery so "this is a 3,200 Mah cell that actually" uses this mag safe connection to not just secure itself but also to charge your phone up I'd say you should expect this grip to be able to charge an iPhone 16 Pro from 0 to 50% not great as far as power Banks go but a damn good bonus if you are already the kind of person who is going to get one of these anyway there's another trick though when you
look at this thing you would expect that this is locked in place and it kind of is I can shake this pretty confidently but I can actually rotate it because it's a magsafe device and that is kind of freaky it is comfortable it's just quite heavy when you pair the phone and the grip the only downside of doing things this way is it means the grip can't be hardwired into your phone so this shutter button is a Bluetooth button and you can kind of tell there's this ever so slight delay every time you
capture which if you're into your cameras enough that you'd want to buy something like this then you'll alter into your cameras enough that it will probably bother you but we can build on this ecosystem so this is the snaplight oh wow so it's definitely in the better than your phone's flashlight category and this is the Aman which is actually just so much better to be honest it's brighter but at the same time it's softer on my face while at the same time having this temperature control which it
just makes this so much more of a pro tool the only real benefit of the snap light is that it lets you flip its mirror around but then why would you ever want to do that because you can already see your face when you're taking selfie video I guess you might want it for makeup but I mean if this is your makeup mirror the the situation is quite dire but then the final piece to this puzzle is the snap pod so this is the so this is the tripod so pretty cool that you can actually attach all three
parts of this rig together at once I like that so I really like the idea of this you know more and more we film bits of our videos using a phone because of how easy the phone makes it and it feels like this whole hit kind of extends that ease into the professional space like it's so cool being able to take my phone off like this and put it on like this adjust the angle up and down and the fact that all three gadgets work together at the same time does create  Synergy that was nearly a full send this
is actually good timing cuz it's part of my problem with the product who designs a tripod that's meant to carry this much weight but the legs don't extend any further than this doesn't even seem to matter what way you put the tripod legs it will just topple I feel like this whole snap system deserves a 5 out of 10 should probably stop using it before it becomes a snapped system this rig was already looking dicey we about two gadgets off turning it into Optimus Prime not that I care as long as the end
footage keeps getting better and better now if we really are trying to make this the best phone camera ever then there's another angle that we haven't touched on yet something that our sponsor Lexa has just figured out so this is the Lexar professional go it's a portable SSD that's a big deal for three reasons first of all this tiny thing can add up to 2 terab of storage to your phone so very possibly 10x in what you can capture the other upside though is it means that we can set our phone to Now
record in even higher quality so now I can switch from the normal iPhone camera to recording in the prores file format using the Blackmagic camera app and if you want to see what the difference is this is footage straight out of the normal iPhone camera set up on our lovely little rig this is prores footage which gives us so much color control but the the final cherry on top is that the SSD comes with a hub which has four USBC ports on it so instead of just being the thing that takes up your phone slot this
actually becomes the center point of your rig so let me add a microphone here to improve my phone's audio quality and then even if I decide that I still want to charge my phone with a cable to get the maximum speed I can still do that using this port here link below to find out more well now we're just getting to the straight up weird this is the X gun light gun which feels like a not so elegant name name for something that's half a classic very strange as seen on Tik Tok product and then half an
actually very serious Gamers controller this thing was $160 and that's actually on discount supposedly the retail price is320 of course it is but if that were true then that would mean you could actually get a phone and a controller for the price of this controller so it had better be something special so at its base this functions as a normal Bluetooth controller although a normal Bluetooth controller with a rather  it it's pretty responsive buttons are nice and clicky I like the d-pad but
then this is gun mode and I won't lie to you looking at the website description this sounds Bonkers it uses gyroscope and laser for precise positioning but then also it has built-in recoil when you fire it is interesting like obviously I'm not automatically an expert at playing games like this but I could see how it would work work and the tracking is actually pretty accurate even though we could only get the gyro part of the positioning to work on phones and then every time you shoot
well I wouldn't go as far as to call it recoil but you feel a vibration that said would I ever actually want to play a game like this not really it's just like when is this ever more comfortable than just this you're never going to do this anywhere remotely public for embarrassment reasons if not criminal ones and this is just not a natural position to keep my wrist bent into not to mention that the controller doesn't lock into either of these positions giving the whole experience a pretty
floppy feel to be honest and that this whole recoil thing it doesn't adapt to what's happening in your game so whether or not you're using a rapid fire machine gun or a single shot rocket launcher it will react and feel the exact same so I'm going to say 4 out of 10 it's cool but it's not useful and there is no way they should be thinking about charging $320 for this on the subject of gaming though here's a concept that thus far I have never seen work successfully a gaming console for the back of your
phone wow wait what the hell that looks sick and then you turn it around and that's the console not going to lie I kind of just want to put it on like this I'm just so confused how the same company that made this masterpiece also made this but this is kind of useful too it's not just a games console this is "also a 5,000 mAh battery bank which" means that instead of being a drag on your phone's battery it's actually sustaining itself while replenishing it wow that is a bad speaker I also can't
reduce the volume oh my God 500 games this is the kind of dread I feel when I go to a restaurant and I realize the menu has a thousand items I actually think the computational power of this machine is so low that it is struggling to both play the music and keep up with my scrolling what the hell okay there's one called Flying turkey I'm just going to go with it some absolutely inspired design choices here I mean power of game console along the side of the screen is something that Nintendo I dare you to
put on your switch 2 it's a weirdly decent gaming experience and yeah you can play this stuff on the front of your phone and you probably should play it on the front of your phone but I can see the appeal of wanting the physical input experience and while I've been playing this my phone has gone up oh 8% now so I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a good product the speaker is appalling and the mag safe connection isn't the most secure by a long shot but I actually weirdly could see myself running out of
phone battery flicking over to this side playing a couple of games until my phone is ready to use again I'd say a surprise seven now if you thought the light gun screened Tik Tok Gadget well this might just be the most tick Tok Gadget I have ever seen no points for guessing where I found it this is meant to be basically the final boss of wireless phone chargers so this at the top gives 15 W Wireless magnetic charging which is good that's the most current industry standard we've got a watch charger over
here this is an airpods charger the main reason this exists though is this button here how do they not know that it's going to hit the watch on the way down just thinking of all issues this mechanism needed to solve there's an obvious why looming over this thing well I guess it gives you two different ways to keep your phone you can have it flat or you can have it facing you but presumably once you've decided which way you want once when would you actually rotate it it serves its base function
it's just nothing about the way that the product's been designed or even the packaging inspires any confidence in its quality so I'm going to give it a five but coming back to camera gear if you wanted to shoot not just good videos but movies on your phone then you'd want to Veer towards something like the New Year phone cage blow NE this thing is tanky so the case slips onto the phone like this it's actually kind of SM that they' built a quick eject mechanism so that
you're not trying to peel metal off your phone as well they've kept the mag safe magnets free it's got a foldable kickstand me impressed the main reason you would ever even think of going for a phone cage like this is that it has a threaded back plate that allows you to attach lenses put it this way the key factor that makes phone cameras not look as cinematic as proper mirrorless cameras is because they have had to design compressed lenses that fit into sub 1 cm thick bodies but now we can
remove that limitation so just before we get to the crazy Big Daddy lens this is a 60 mm telephoto which we can now just screw into our setup so this is what our phone footage already looks like without this lens and you'll notice by the way how good the audio sounds now given that we have this external microphone but this is what it looks like with the lens it's not just way more zoomed in but the extra space that we've created within the glass allows for that really natural
cinematic background blur I just think this looks so good but if you wanted to take this to the absolute extreme this is a macro Pro blend you don't see phone gadgets like this very often I mean just the way it's packaged makes it look like something James Bond would quietly set up at a 10th story hotel room window before using it to kill someone three buildings away and then pack it up and leave you were thinking that too right so let's be very clear this is not the kind of lens that you would use for
General day-to-day shooting this lens is designed for a very specific type of shot a very closeup but still very high quality angle using a lens that's so thin that it can actually get inside of things which is why you need LEDs on the end to light those things up so it gets more ridiculous we have got it onto a motorized slider to make sure this shot comes out just right the lens does not have very good inbuilt stabilization but get it right and you take something that should not be possible on a phone I'd
give this 60 mil lens a 9 out of 10 so small and such a powerful effect the pro Blends more like a seven just as cool about five times as unwieldy a Moment of Truth for the clean station it's been 5 days since we put the phone through that toaster thing oh my God so this is the sample taken before the phone was cleaned that is actually Grim there is so many colonies here this is the sample taken after cleaning it's it's actually still not great but it's a hell of a lot better
than before cleaning and then this is the control test so this is one where we put no swab in just to check that the experiment works so there you have it not Flawless but a pretty good product so did we just build the most over engineered phone rig ever probably does it also look like a Call of Duty kill streak definitely let me know if you want to see an episode two
