a few weeks ago I switched out my Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra for Samsung's newest folding firms the Z fold 6 and the Z flip 6 and cards on the table I got some bones to pick so starting with the fold on one hand this is nice a neatened up lighter thinner faster version of the last phone but every time I take it out my pocket I also can't help but feel like Samsung hasn't fixed the fundamental issues here and I'm not sure Samsung is even trying to fix the fundamental issues so if you're coming
from a non-folding phone the first thing that you're going to instantly notice is the crease and it's getting to the point where now I am perplexed I am perplexed how even six Generations in Samsung still hasn't managed to just fix this line going down the middle of their screen that companies like OnePlus have already proved can be done better with their gen one folding phones they just need to improve the hinge it's the way this phone is pinching on the screen every time you close it and it's only
going to get more noticeable the more you use it the main rear cameras are good is what I would say if this was an $800 phone coming from the s24 ultra you really can feel the compromise whether that's the more limited Zoom range the slightly less reliable focusing system thanks to the lack of laser autofocus or just the extra bit of graininess that creeps into dark photos and videos because of the smaller sensor here now most people who go out and buy and use this phone probably won't know what
they're missing out on but that's my job having used both of these phones to tell you that what you're getting here stings a little bit especially considering that you can now get a brand new Galaxy s24 "Ultra for like $1,000 while the zold 6" "will run you $1,900 it's two times the" price and it shouldn't be see it made complete sense to me that the first Galaxy fold was significantly more expensive than a normal phm I mean a lot of R&amp;D would have been required to build
all the new parts and Concepts from scratch for something that Samsung didn't expect to sell many units of so they had to recoup the cost somehow but that's not the case anymore in the current market this hinge and this folding screen these are standard Parts this phone almost definitely does not cost more than $200 extra to produce than this but it's like $8 to $900 more expensive to you for no other reason then that's become the default expectation for a fault and they know
they can get away with it paying $1900 for a phone you would expect this to be the place where Samsung throws every single thing they got at the wall but instead you get basically the same camera setup as not even the s24 ultra but the tiny base Galaxy s24 and your selfie cameras are even worse the front one's not too bad it takes 10 megap shots that make you look nice it's standard Samsung fair but the inside 4 megapix camera makes you look sick and I I don't mean that as a compliment I mean
that literally shooting photos on this reminds me of shooting photos on the PlayStation Portable camera like 15 years ago and I have heard a few people saying well this camera is designed for video calling which is low quality anyway so you're not going to notice the resolution but disagree the resolution is so low that you can't record 4K video with it which I have found myself wanting to do a pretty decent amount the camera seems to have a persistent faintness to it presumably because of
the extra layer of pixels on top of it but also since the whole appeal of a phone is to use it while it's open and use flex mode to prop the thing up to record videos I don't think you can argue that this camera is only for video calls at least 20% of the time this is the camera that you're going to want to use to shoot stuff so the quality really matters and it just makes you wonder how did this happen Samsung introduced this 4 megapixel under display camera on the zold 3 it was terribly received then and
they've had the four the five and now the six to fix this and so how have we ended up in a situation where this is "the camera experience from a $2,000 2024" Flagship grade Enthusiast smartphone anyways the front screen is wider than it was before which is a nice Improvement it looks neater they've got rid of all of the weird Corner screen bezels but it does still feel just a little bit like like no man's land it's very close to feeling like you're using a normal phone and that's impressive
considering what this is but it's still just a little worse in every way a little bit too tall a little bit too narrow and a decent amount chunkier than a Barone and this whole structure creates a bit of a thermal compromise too it's not hugely surprising I mean when unfolded you're having to light up a larger screen area which creates more heat and then when folded this is a thicker slab which makes it harder for that heat to escape and this isn't some Niche perk that only affects your gaming
frame rates after prolonged periods of play so many times when I have this phone open and it's like slightly warm outside I'm noticing I can barely see my screen because it's dimming itself to try and prevent overheating and two times it's actually gone one step further and refused to open my apps CU of temperature just to clarify I don't live on some subtropical Paradise Island basked in Sun all day I live in the UK there is no reason I should be getting temperature warnings this severe with
normal usage oh yeah also one of the things I love about the Galaxy s24 Ultra is the battery life that's one phone that I've never had to worry about but this with both a smaller battery capacity and a larger screen to power it runs out anywhere between 15 and 25% faster and that puts it very much in the anxiety Zone I mean I do nowadays pretty much always carry around a power bank so I'm not left stranded but that's just made me realize how much more often I reaching for power here the flip does
kind of fix this issue but I'm getting to that phone there was also quite a bit of emphasis that Samsung placed on the new AI features here of course they did it's 2024 but uh are they good some of them are I'd say the vast majority do still fall into the fun to play with but I won't use often category I suppose the most useful kinds of AI features are the ones that allow you to do things that you already do but better or faster as opposed to the ones that just continuously add more different options
because you know we're only human there's only so many features that you're going to be able to integrate into your life but this is why I love the idea of all of this automatic translation stuff like being able to have a WhatsApp chat across a usually impenetrable language barrier but not not actually having to think about the language barrier anymore and also the new smart select tool it's exactly what I was saying it's making the kinds of things that you'd already be doing
anyways trying to fiddle around and select stuff faster I was also super excited about this new sketch to image and there are moments where it all works the way you expected where you manage to perfectly place a one-of-a-kind dinosaur within the scene of your day out in the park and you feel like the protagonist in a superh hero movie at the single moment where unlimited power has just been dropped in your lap but I would say there's too many constraints right now it seems like there's some sort of
safety restriction when it comes to adding things to faces which I mean it makes sense considering all the Havoc that's been wrought by Deep fakes lately but then at the same time faces are the main useful thing that you might want to add things to and there's also other issues I'm bumping into like draw smaller objects or Draw objects closer together to generate I think Samsung's just not ready for my big Ideas yet and you know what using this feature consistently reminds me of just how
silly it is that the one phone specifically designed to look and feel like a not ad does not come with a built-in S Pen like the s24 ultra does you know the smaller of the two phones so the only real remaining question is then do the folding features make it all worth it I feel like I've made it pretty clear at this point that you're giving up a lot to get these features you're paying twice as much money you're having to deal with a crease a terrible unders screen camera two displays with
unorthodox aspect ratios a compromised battery and no S Pen so should you well as far as the physical act of being able to prop your phone up on flat surfaces it feels cool I've used it a fair bit to record time lapses of things happening or watch movies on a Plane by sitting the phone up on my trade table but it doesn't really matter I would say you'll actually have a distinctly better experience just using a normal phone with a kickstand case since you'll get a bigger more natural screen ratio and
also often times with these cases magnets for better wireless charging I mean there are things that do uniquely utilize the display on this phone the taskbar for starters is an amazing addition this whole one tap to instantly being in another R is a genuinely UNG gimicky efficiency Improvement that you just can't have on a smaller phone but ultimately it's not for me you might know that I spent a few months trying to use an iPad as my main computer and the whole reason that failed was simply
because of the mobile operating system same thing here while it is impressive how much this thing can do for a phone the truth is that for most people this phone is still a little bit too fiddly and not quite efficient enough to be a good main computer which makes it hard to justify given that for this price you can actually buy a good equivalently performing flagship phone and still have the money left over for a great laptop so I fold and if you're looking at buying this please make absolute sure
that these specific folding features are things that you'll definitely use because if you splurge on a fold and all you end up doing is playing Candy Crush but either squeezed or stretched that will be a poor purchase decision I just feel like these Z folds are a little bit stuck not that many people are buying them so Samsung seems to have lost the drive to actually fix the fundamental compromises which in turn makes them persistently hard to recommend outside of their Niche the flip six though is
actually very different and in my opinion a phone that makes more sense if the fold is the insecure teenager trying desperately to be something they're not the flip is its eccentric sibling who sure they're a little bit odd but they understand who they're trying to be through many years of bulking up the specs on these phones ITA Samsung's now got to a stage where the Galaxy Z flip 6 is basically a flagship Galaxy s24 plus that costs $1 to $200 more more but folds in half and that isn't pointless
it's partly just a bit of fun which doesn't hurt in an era where everyone's always saying that smartphones have peaked I can't lie if Samsung ever gave you the option to have their top end Ultra phones also fold without any compromises I take it in a heartbeat and they've really dialed into that fun with all the unique front screen customization and funky case options and this new uh photo ambient feature which overlays real weather effects onto photos that you've taken it's very
pointless but brings me joy it's got a potential lifestyle benefit because unlike the front of the zold 6 which is basically just a slightly less comfortable phone the front of the flip 6 it has a very clearly distinct feature set to the main screen this is much more like having a smartphone and then a completely separate smart watch as opposed to this which is like a smartphone and then a slightly worse smartphone and when I switched over to the zflip 5 last year I did find that
the physical barrier to go from this Smartwatch stage to the smartphone stage actually did make me use my phone L and then you do lose the three times telephoto camera that the s24 plus has so you only get a main and an ultra wide but I would actually say that it makes up for it with selfies see unlike the fold which can use its high-end rear cameras to take selfies here that's actually the default way to take selfies if you want to take good selfies on the fold you have to unfold open the camera
flip that camera tap the cover screen preview button physically turn the phone over being careful not to swipe anything on screen and then take your shot before closing it all back up again here you just double tap the power button and then tap the screen it's not a perfect system because then at the same time anytime you want to take a photo of what's in front of you you do have to manually flip the phone open but the point is this phone is a unique proposition that makes it distinct and
useful for more than 1% of the population now there are a few things that I would say are compromised like you still have to deal with the crease but for whatever reason it is significantly less noticeable on this flip than it is the fold the buttons are a little high up when the phone's open and I do feel like they could quite easily shove them down and they'd still work fine in both unfolded and folded States the screen is a little bit tall not as tall as the cover screen on the
fold but still taller than I'd like and it's only got a 1080p resolution as opposed to the Quad HD that you get on their flat flagships but I think that's okay I keep my phone on 1080p anyways for battery life and temperature reasons and it's got the same chip as the s24 ultra same Ram same base storage same wireless charging speeds and yeah the battery capacity is smaller too just like the fold also has a smaller battery than normal bar phones but unlike the fold which is like a normal phone that
extends into a big tablet this is a normal phone that folds into something half that size which means you save a lot of battery compared to a normal phone and you end up with something very close to that of an s24 plus so my through line for this phone is very much that six Generations in you still have to make compromises for a phone that folds if all you want is the best bang for your buck it isn't this and to be honest it never will be this however if you just really like the idea of a
folding phone then you're giving up surprisingly little to get it here and you also scoop up a couple of little perks while you're at it too so I had a funny situation a couple of weeks ago I was stuck in a plane while England was in the Euros football final which by the way the men's team has never won so this was a big deal and it felt like every single person on that flight wanted to do one thing and one thing only find a way to stream the game but they couldn't the football was being streamed for free
in the UK on BBC player but you know "when you're flying 40,000 ft above the" Atlantic Ocean your phone is going to know that and the app will refuse to play due to Geographic license restrictions I could literally see the lady in front of me searching live for the best VPN deals on this flight so you can imagine how desperately desperately I wanted to grab her and tell her that I had it is this Sur Shar VPN we pulled it up we switched our location to the UK and we managed to watch England fudge
the finals once more live after which we kind of wish we hadn't bothered but the point is I'm consistently glad that I have this subscription and given that with the code boss you can now get it for just $29 a month with a 30-day money back guarantee for an unlimited number of users with four extra months for free it's a bit of a no-brainer
