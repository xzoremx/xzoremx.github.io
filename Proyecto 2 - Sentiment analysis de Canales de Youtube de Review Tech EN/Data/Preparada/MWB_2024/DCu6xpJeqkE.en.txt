let me show you how the Snapdragon X Elite chip finally makes Windows laptops good firstly it enables you to do proper AI jobs like sketch with Microsoft Paint but also alongside it adding an AI prompt so the AI can build well a better version of whatever you're trying to make and live captions which means that any audio that you hear can be translated and written out for you in plain text you could literally have a video call with someone speaking Spanish and you will see the English translation
written on your screen but there's another side to it the power efficiency is crazy which means three things one that you can now expect 15 to 20 hours of usage time per charge which is the first time in 4 years that Windows is actually back on track with apple two that you're going to have like at most 1% battery leakage overnight while on standby but also it means that your chip can always stay on the second you open your laptop lid your laptop is on it's ready to go but you know the thing that
surprised me more than anything else is how much better your camera quality becomes the image signal processor on the Snapdragon X Elite chip upgrades both the audio and the video quality and the difference is not subtle
