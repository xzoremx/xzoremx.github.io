the infinix note 40 Pro Plus is a brand new phone with a secret hidden feature on the back here's why it's an absolute Game Changer starters this is a magnetic charger so it snaps in place onto the back of the case to make wireless charging more efficient and quick but unlike Apple's Magi this charger is also a power bank so at any point you can just uncp it take it around with the phone wherever you go and you have a "total of 6,500 Mah hours of battery" capacity just above that there is the
active Halo when you do stuff on your phone it reacts to it and that includes your charging progress as well as dancing to the music you're currently playing being a better version of your camera flash and when you're talking to your phone's assistant it'll pulse to mimic its words and that brings me on to the assistant because here AI poers you can basically ask your phone to plan your entire holiday feed when you do run out of juice multi-p speed charging so when you plug it in it can start
charging Full Throttle at 100 W literally 50% battery in 8 minutes so then you can also tweak that charger to favor lower temperatures and long-term battery health
