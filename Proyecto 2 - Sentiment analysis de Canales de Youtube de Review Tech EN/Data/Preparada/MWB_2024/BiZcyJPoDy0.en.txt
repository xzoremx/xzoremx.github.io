"I'm about to spend $112,000 in the next" 5 minutes buying the most indestructible Tech in the world and then we're going to compare it to normal Tech to find out just how much it can withstand so I guess we might as well start with the laptop oh my God this thing looks like a beast oh it's not cheap I guess if you want a rugged laptop you can either buy a rugged laptop or you can buy a very rugged case for your laptop and that's $80 we can get both and compare them okay Ultra durable Smartwatch so you
obviously have the Apple watch Ultra 2 oh we should get one of the ultra 2os and then we should compare that directly with the durability of the Bas level Apple watch in theory durability should be the main reason for paying twice as much money and then you've got the Guard Pro Ultra 2 plus does say though that it's sturdier than all competitors you know how much of a sucker I am for the internal desire to prove claims wrong ah and we also have to accompany that with the most durable phone you got black
view oh those bezels are horrendous it seems like on most lists though it's Nokia that tops it we could get this the the new Nokia but then we could also get the old Nokia you know like the 3310 the original brick compare those two to see how much durability has evolved over the years that's that's a fun idea oh yeah in all of these videos I love to get a keyboard in that theme so what can we get for the most durable what maltron single hand keyboard it looks like it'll take about five hands to use wo that 
the all right I found what I think is the best one but $600 I am very curious how much stronger that can be versus just the $10 keyboard you get from Amazon ah how are we going to charge all of our most durable gadgets with the most durable cable of course we need to find something that's like proper industrial grade oh Cy this one's made with Kevlar does like the same material that's used for bulletproof vests oh this one looks like it could take some damage oh it actually says the these
cables are also made from indestructible materials well then you sir have earned yourself a space on this video you may live to regret that comment the same website also has a power brick SL light baked into one indestructible package Ah that's something I didn't think about like an incredibly durable incredibly waterproof camera we can present the testing section underwater please help me you're too much ring apparently someone's come up with an indestructible TV wait what are you doing this is hard
to what would you look at that Ultra tough SD cards that would actually solve a real problem that we have constantly snapping them okay I just want to find the most random indestructible Tech ah yes the indestructible dog chew toy for aggressive chewers says here indestructible puffer 15 times stronger than steel build to keep you warm down to -30Â° cus 30 okay sure why not there's even an indestructible fan I'd guess it's designed for construction sites oh they got a Tik Tok video wao okay it
feels like some sort of like rights violation is from the company Big Ass Fans ah so we've spent all this time looking for indestructible gadgets right well this the Pelican air is basically saying whatever you put inside of it it in itself is such a durable carry case  indestructible someone's actually made an indestructible coffee maker play coffee is an essential DeWall makes a speaker you know that if they've made a speaker they've done their due diligence okay um there's actually no
one here to take the laptop away for me so I'm going to have to self discipline myself but yeah let's uh skip to when the products arrive everything is finally here I've got my tools of Destruction and 17 unlucky products that are about to face them so let's go roughly for least expensive to most expensive first up being our rugged cable which the website labels as the strongest and fastest charging cable on the planet an absolutely outrageous claim that we have to confirm ourselves well it certainly
feels like a cable that could take some damage so let's just go to the extreme "end with it this is a 1,000 kg car can" you tow it with one of them now obviously no one is ever going to actually need to do this but if the cable can take this it says a lot about its ability to take General wear and  one that did not work that did not work at all I think we lost a piece of the car oh yeah and the cable is absolutely wrecked yes this was a tough test but if you call yourself unbreakable you are
kind of asking for it 4 out of 10 and from the same company at $87 the camping light and this is going to help us answer a question that I've always wondered about it's a really common thing in the tech world to see something that's shock proof or impact resistant  that was close but unlike water or dust resistance which are pretty clear what does shockproof mean like is that a shock ow is this a shock oh okay still works but don't worry we have actually gone and hired a
full-on not so secure feeling Boom Lift so that we can find out exactly how drop resistant this stuff actually is so let start with a 5 m drop so a lot higher than it seems 3 2 1 that felt like it did nothing 5 m onto a concrete surface is a very significant drop but look light is on it's barely  marked I can't even get myself to stand up straight 3 2 1 oh there we go that was it okay so the frame is cracked the top is separated does it still function no circuit board's gone as well
game over for the rugged a very respectable showing though 9 out of 10 and while we're here we might as well also see how our DeWalt speak aairs okay so how does it sound ooh not bad at all it's only coming from One Direction but providing you're at that direction you're having a good time with this it's very full sound and really detailed too a 10 m drop onto pure concrete would be enough to end almost All Electronics come on DWT I believe in you let's see if the Music [Applause]
Stops I guess that's why they have detachable batteries okay so technically the music did stop but we need to work out if that's because the battery separated or because it's actually dead the physical damage on the speaker really doesn't look too bad and it does indeed power on well done very very cool that's a strong 9 out of 10 product 10 out of 10 if it had surround sound but if you think that was durable then I don't think I've ever even seen claims like the ones that this next product
makes a notebook but fit to withstand an alien invasion by the looks of it so this right here is a reinforced carbon fiber cover which to be fair you might have seen before but the most shocking bit is the pages these are not paper or cardboard or any variant of it this is pressed Limestone so let me do a little Doodle on this first page and then let's say I decide actually I hate that what Okay so it's not completely tear proof If you're trying but it's definitely safe to say it's tear
resistant you have to put a lot of effort into do that oh and a sub to the channel would be well not terrible okay so tear resistance check but what about all weather conditions wait so if I just like Pat it dry no way the drawing is completely unchanged the paper looks completely intact even while both the pen and the paper are absolutely drenched I can still carry on drawing I mean just for a point of reference this is what happens with a normal notebook when you wet it poor Smiley it
claims to be oilproof which I mean yeah my fingers are not showing up at all but to be fair what if we just did this what if you're just cooking your Italian food and you accidentally spill it okay so this right now looks like a crime scene but wipe and the page is completely usable oh God table's starting to feel like an Italian Kitchen actually I apologize for what is about to happen little salt little pepper this might be the first time anyone has ever tried to cook their notebook wo not
fireproof so the binder and the outer cover completely fireproof Pages not so much should probably stop breathing that in I'm a little disappointed cuz it did specifically say that it was fire resistant that put up no resistance to fire but hey at least it did survive the most important categories no one's actually going to blow torch their notebook 6 out of 10 but as we go higher on the price list things are about to get even more advanced so these are the earphones that allow you to listen to
music underwater if this works the way I think it works it's going to allow me to experience something I've never experienced before and actually to show it we're also going to need to whip out another one of our products the Olympus Tough tg7 the and I promise I'm not making this up the actual Never Going To Give You Up camera oh and then we compare that with the Sony tough SD card oh the synergies here giving me tingles and this might actually tangibly improve all of our lives here cuz we have gotten
through our fair share of SD cards it really doesn't take much so this is a single piece resin molded design that's trying to essentially remove every single one of the vulnerabilities or a normal SD card like the seam in between each half the connector ribs the right protect switch and as a result it's apparently 18 times stronger than a normal SD card so both of these are loaded with top secret files this is a bowl of water blueberries ginger ale don't ask me what cocktail I'm making here do it as well
and then I'm just going to leave that for 10 minutes a few minutes later right let's see if well either of these still work start with the ultra tough SD card oh straight away it shows up let's just make sure it loads properly I love how the SD card is just called tough oh yes there's a good reason why these files are confidential okay so that works although it might not after that  card oh it's not loaded anything just a bit of Ginger oil no that is actually dead so that already
justifies the existence of this tough SD card but I have a sneakier idea an idea that can work out the true break resistance of this new SD card the door slam like I've had a nightmare about this exact situation 3 2 1 oh okay so the tape is completely uprooted there's clearly like a hairline fracture on the SD card itself so if we put it inside of our camera card error I think we might have killed it so these SD cards are absolutely tough but they're not invincible so we'll just stick one of
our normal peasant SD cards into this camera go for a swim oh wow it's very cool that this camera double locks itself for maximum waterproofing now just before I make the jump earphones because as well as the normal issue of waterproofing the design and making sure the sound stays intact and also just stopping the earphones floating away there's a bigger problem that has prevented most Bluetooth earphones from working underwater range while Bluetooth in the air might have a range of like 30
ft because it's a very low power connection it does not fight through water molecules very well so that 30t range in a swimming pool could well become like 4 in so to address that these zygo earphones have a radio receiver and an app that basically allows your phone to broadcast via much more powerful radio waves okay let's hit record on this camera there you go now I can definitely buy that this is completely waterproof by the way they've got this custom proprietary charging pin
connector when I put it on yep that's not going to float away so it solves that problem and then as far as the sound being transmitted in the water it's bone conduction which is why it's got such a clamping force on the sides of my head but now it's time to test the big question is it going to actually carry on playing even as I jump into the  it works it works the sound quality is not the best it just sounds like everything is quite far from your ears but can't do out with airpods 8 out of
10 okay so waterproofing we've established this has but it also claims to be freeze prooof so this is some very real dry ice that is genuinely as cold as - 80Â° C which is absolutely Bonkers look how quickly it turns to gas just as it meets the air which is already pretty cold as it is you eat one of these you're in for a very bad evening so I've hit record just in case this survives I have some doubts and now and you go my temperature sens are saying it's off the scale this doesn't even go past -3Â° C I
can see the temperature of the camera itself falling if you're still alive down there I am very impressed Well Done Right that is 10 minutes the camera has reached below -20Â° C which is well out of operating range now the question is is it still recording the camera feed is still going look at the screen that is absolutely Wild and the wrist strap everything from the screen to the lens is completely frozen over the camera still lives at heart which means I mean a 10 out of 10 products but also
B there's a very specific way we can test this further but it will need a product from later in this video weird kind of day today but now feels like a pretty good time for a coffee break so this is our Makita coffee maker designed for a delicious Brew even in the absolute harshest conditions and is it just me or does this look an awful lot like a video game prop so we're talking things like a cup that almost locks itself in place inside of the machine allowing coffee to come in whilst also
insulating it and keeping all dirt out as well as boil dry protection which just prevents the machine from burning out if the water empties and the temperature inside starts to go up there is a sensor that will turn off the power supply automatically but does it taste good will it keep out all the dust from a construction site what happens if you knock it over I really like the tactil of this design and then your coffee goes in here and the other cool part of this is that this is a battery and now let's
say I'm on my construction site I'm carrying my wood and oh my goodness me does it carry on making coffee no it does not so clearly this coffee machine is extremely durable and it's got all sorts of mechanisms that are going to save it from situations like that but I think it'd be so cool if this mug created a complete allaround seal with this machine so that even if you knock it like that it can carry on dripping coffee into it I'd say Makita gets a four there is some pretty serious damage
on the side here but the product does still work and there is some spare coffee in this mug so thankfully I don't have to drink it cuz now we have our boiling cup of coffee I feel like it's a pretty good time for a type of product whose worst nightmare is normally Cofe keyboards so this is the Vandal resistant keyboard which to be honest I think is slightly underselling it oh my goodness M it's made of stainless steel for starters I mean how many times do you see someone buy an actually steel keyboard it's
environmentally sealed against basically any incoming particle but can it take a boiling hot cup of coffee I know my keyboard couldn't so I'm playing some Red Dead Redemption right now some incredibly wide looking Red Dead Redemption for my incredibly wide keyboard the buttons require so much force to press this is like the worst possible keyboard for gaming but I will say the track ball this thing Glides you do definitely feel the side effect of a keyboard not designed for gaming like
the latency is absolutely atrocious oh no I'm having to fight every Instinct in my body to film this video there's a clear reason why coffee is like the single biggest killer of electronics it's boiling hot it's wet and then if neither of those two kills it when it dries it is sticky so it's pretty clear that we we've already survived the first two of those prongs but let's come back in a little bit to see if it survives the third stepping it up to $800 now it's time for the Apple watch Ultra 2
I'm interested to see how well or how poorly an Apple product something that you'd consider quite mainstream is going to fit into this extreme caliber of indestructible Tech does it Shine or does it just get embarrassed well if you read the spec sheet Apple went hard with the ultra watches rugged Aerospace grade titanium case sapphire crystal display literally 100 m water resistance which is more than well basically any human could do without proper proper training and not even just that military level
impact resistance altitude protection high temperature low temperature dust dirt temperature shock immersion freezing and thawing extreme vibration whatever that's for but okay we get it your watch is probably going to outlive you but the question that I think is more interesting is how much more durable is it actually versus a standard Apple watch and I guess even more interestingly something like the $90 Guard Pro Ultra let's find out now obviously the packaging is far simpler
and less exciting but that's okay I'd much rather for $90 that they actually spent that money making the watch good and at least according to their website this thing would stands - 40Â° F cold and 131Â° heat which is funly enough 1Â° more than Apple and I do not think that is an accident my prediction and I guess also what you'd like to think given how much more expensive this is than this is that these guard guys haven't done anything on a hardware level that should allow
this to withstand more but that they've just been looser with their claims cuz of course they're also less likely to get investigated for them now very quickly just as a watch it feels like strong sturdy solid metal construction it doesn't actually feel that dissimilar in Hardware quality to the Apple watch Ultra but here's the thing my recent trip to India has made it very clear to me that it's not expensive to make a smartwatch that feels good we paid $15 for something equivalent and the
software here is not nice right this is boiling hot water it's hotter than any of these watches are rated for let's do it okay both Apple watches have turned off funny enough the guard is still on you can tell they did not like that every single Watch is completely functional all buttons work the screen works so to some extent they're almost being conservative with their temperature estimates but to be fair if you end up in literally boiling water you have bigger problems than your watch so
probably a more realistic test for most people will be scratches I've got a scratch on my own personal series 9 and it goes right across the middle of the screen and I notice it every single time I look at the thing oh so the guard is quite significantly scratching even with the level six hardness pick but on both Apple watches nothing okay level Seven's a little worse on the guard and still basically nothing on the Apple Watch series 9 and since there's nothing on the series 9 I'm not surprised to see
there's nothing on the ultra either which means it's level eight time this is where damage happens oh yeah it slices through the guard ah pretty significant damage to the series 9 too so what about the ultra wow very very slight damage but almost nothing I know what you're thinking though you want to see the upper limit you want to see Carnage well this is a 13.5 kg iron ball and trust me when I say you drop this on something it hurts 3 2 1 maybe we shouldn't have shopped at
IKEA I mean the fact that the table is more broken than the watch does tell you something about the watch okay so the screen is actually miraculously no more marked than it was after the scratching but clearly serious damage has happened on the inside this is dead I'm a little scared now what  1 but the screen is still completely functional fair play the capacitive touchscreen still works the button still works there's actually not a single sign that anything UNT has happened to this
watch apart from those initial scratches and then finally sorry I it does kind of look like an Apple ad and uh yeah I guess as expected after the Apple Watch series 9 performance nothing absolutely nothing there's less damage on this after that than there is on my daily watch while we do know you clearly pay a premium for Apple products that is one hell of a design to withstand that and so ratings 5 8 10 it's Nokia time and this I am super excited to see how much has this company
in the roughly 25 years since the 3310 improved their durability if at all as far as specs go this new xr21 has the military standard 810h which is like the eighth generation of what the military considers all around stress proof drop resistance rain resistance and an ip69k rating this for this has uh two layers of plastic that's it but something so simple has allowed this phone to basically reach legendary meme Overlord status as famously indestructible so the first test can both phones get wet
oh I near you lost one this is 40Â° C Water by the way with a spot of chlorine 3 2 1 so the original Nokia 3310 oh no o it's powered down is that the end of the line already I'm actually very surprised considering what this phone is known for but yeah the Nokia 3310 is totaled the new xr21 is completely fine it literally has just Shrugged it off so clearly waterproofing has improved a lot since this thing came out but what about shatter proofing yes we're back here again we hired the Boom
Lift we might as well use it for science starting with the old Nokia 3 2   1 wo that was quite impressive okay so the fact that this old Nokia is in three pieces is a little bit of a red herring cuz that is actually how it's designed to fall so that it can absorb more impact but as well as being deconstructed this is also just straight up smashed like there's a crack in the glass and the plastic is also pretty scuffed up it's no Gorilla Glass what is it like Monkey Glass
okay but this right here feels like a bit of a moment of truth that was an enormous drop its counterpart has been shattered the new noia does it survive Moment of Truth oh my God this thing is just blissfully unaware of what I've done to it I mean yeah you've got a scrape up top here but this is a pretty clear sign that Nokia has done some work here this might just be the new meme phone and we don't even know it yet as far as durability is concerned 10 out of 10 I don't know where I'm walking to be
honest now this so-called indestructible jacket I have to say I think it looks absolutely terrible I'm genuinely confused right now did I just pay like $600 for a jacket that comes without a proper package looks like it's made of complete plastic with all the insulation power of a tank top but okay if we just put my personal feelings aside for a minute this is made of 100% dyema black a fiber that's five times stronger than Kevlar and 15 times stronger than steel wait so it says the material we've used
is so tough it was originally used in body armor anti-ballistic vehicle armor and ropes used to tie down oil rigs in violent icc's and then there's me who's probably going to use it for at most a walk in the park it comes with shatterproof buttons that it says are made with the world's toughest nuts whatever that means with claims like this and a price tag like this the thing that's going through my mind is what happens if you stab it does this coat make you invincible okay maybe I was a little bit
harsh having tried it on and having seen it on this handsome fellow so maybe it's not exactly the crime against fashion that I initially pegged it as but it is still quite underwhelming looking considering the price we paid that said this is not a clothing Channel I'm interested in the technology behind this jacket wait what it's dead already and if someone came at you on the street with a flamethrower in hand you'd be well out of luck to be clear this is not just burnt it is on
fire that's a problem we've got a hose I've got a hose oh no come on come on come on oh thank God thank goodness me the ripped jeans look someone's probably into this we were wondering when we first took this out why all the police don't wear something like this are they just hoping that like no one actually tests it and they just assume they're wearing an indestructible jacket right so we've already failed the fire test but I am curious how well this material stands up to other stresses Like a  o
actually that did kind of tear it but not close to as badly as a normal jacket would have been I guess this kind of demonstrates part of the problem with a jacket like this that while the jacket itself may be able to resist various different forms of damage you can't and this provides you no actual padding when it comes to that so while it is extremely cool to wear a material like that it's not actually functional for a normal person in an everyday scenario Mario it provides you no warmth no Comfort at all
"and no real protection at over $2,000" now this is the Traxxas xmax ultimate whose name alone probably signifies how unbelievably excessive it is we did previously test this thing's younger cousin in our fastest gadgets video if you remember that one but this is basically that on steroids oh my goodness me I'm talking energy absorbing "impact cushions apparently over $11,000" in high strength aluminium placed throughout the car in all key is really "$11,000 I have doubts but one thing you"
can't doubt is how unbelievably solid this thing feels it's got belted Sledgehammer tires and so much waterproofing that they actually recommend that you just hose it off if it gets muddy okay then 3 2 1 woohoo oh my God wait can I just carry on steering W this thing may be Invincible I am not you know I feel like the best way to demonstrate just how monstrous of a vehicle that is is to show you side by side with a normal RC car it looks like an ant I'm kind of curious what would happen if these two 
collided ah and I've have not forgotten about this ridiculous Olympus camera if this is truly the authentic Never Going To Give You Up experience it should be able to withstand a full frontal assault from a 50 mph vehicle right if I miss this we get no test and I just take down the rig oh and side note I don't think in my life I have ever seen acceleration and breaking like that on a remote  1 the screen still on Olympus you sexy beast it's still working and as for the car much much
more durable than it seems the endurance claims are no lie 9 out of 10 but now it's time to find out how much paying the premium matters for laptops because entering the firing line is the Dell Latitude 14 yeah their rugged range definitely does not come with as much packaging love as their gaming laptops wait how Earth do you open this is this some kind of LGE oh right I'm just weak but that is a hinge man if this thing is as durable as it is hard to open then we are in for a treat
and it's not just durability it's got dual hot swappable batteries in case you run out of charge in the middle of nowhere the screen is touchcreen so if I tap here yeah that opens but also because it's designed to work in temperature in which your hands might well literally fall off it works with gloves too and these aren't even touchscreen gloves side note the brightness is insane which I guess is especially important for a laptop that's designed to be used out and about and
the touchpad it actually feels a little bit less slick than you're probably used to but that's because this is a resistive touchpad as opposed to being a capacitive one as for what the actual difference is this is quite cool I can show you exactly what it is via the AR AI baked into the Opera desktop browser so what's the difference between a capacitive and a resistive touch panel tell me in two sentences okay so it's got an answer a capacitive touch panel uses the electrical properties of the
human body to detect touch resulting in a more responsive and accurate touch experience in contrast a resistive touchscreen relies on pressure applied to the screen making it less precise and often requiring a stylus or a fingernail to operate yeah that's kind of perfect so the reason the resistive pad feels less slick is because it requires that pressure unlike your phone for example which has a capacitive screen that you can just Glide your finger across but the benefit of this over capacitive is
that water messes with conduction whereas water isn't going to apply the pressure required to activate this one having an AI at your fingertips that literally the Press of a button is one of the most incredible features of the Opera browser and I strongly recommend you give it a go using my link in the description and yes this laptop is completely unharmed but here's the bigger question how does its durability compare to just a laptop case these products are summoning out a destructive
side to my personality okay so obviously you are going to lose out on a lot of those extra like the battery swapability and literally if I so much as put a drop of water on this trackpad it will seize to function properly but if all you want is the impact protection then how well does a case serve the exact same purpose well this one to its credit has a lot going for it it's got a one piece hinge design with what they call an armor shell as well as a soft impact resistant
core and credit Weare credits due they have also thought about a lot of the little things like the reinforced Corners like the rubberized feet like the extra grip around the areas you hold the laptop so that you're less likely to drop it in the first place so we'll start by dropping the cased MacBook Air and then we'll drop this beautiful Dell Latitude laptop Ready set go oh that sound was beautiful and haunting  1 that actually got the hinge to open right starting with the MacBook clear
damage on the case itself that was the least I expected though you can see quite a bit of dirt has gotten inside the case which is not a great sign so dents all over the bottom of the  oh oh it's dead that's kind of a shame considering that most of the body is still intact I feel like that's been one of the ongoing themes in this video even if the outer Hardware is strong enough to withstand a lot of these impacts the technology at its core still has a lot of vulnerabilities what about about this
though a laptop that does look a lot more like it has a reason to be in a construction site like this okay hinge opens straight away look at that screen is on do all the keys work yeah they do holy moly can you even tell what this thing has been through literally the entire damage to this laptop is a scratch that is 10 out of 10 outstanding construction right returning to this keyboard oh it looks horrendous sa to say I have sticky keys turned on but really this is still
functioning as if I hadn't spilled a mug of boiling hot coffee on it and then let it sit there okay so that's good but if you're a real criminal trying to actually steal something you probably  coffee uh how is that not even denting it what about a Hammer Hammer right to the track ball ooh that does no longer work so it feels like the materials of this construction could take 10 times the beating that I'm giving to it but it's just there must be some sort of vulnerability underneath
this trackpad that I've gotten to  curious okay yeah that does somewhat damage it I guess the most important part of a keyboard meant for high security environments is that no one can get inside and that it does achieve very well but wow yeah I mean the thickness of this keyboard is very much indicative of its durability 8 out of 10 and finally the Pelican Air carry case which is apparently designed with a super light proprietary hpx polymer that's 40% lighter than normal plastic because of
course the lighter your box the less momentum it's going to have when it lands and because this is the last product in what's otherwise been a very intense video let's just do something stupid and fun this is an egg I don't think there's any way this actually works but I just want to try so we play inside this waterproof Crush prooof  1 feel like the next city would have heard that one the egg excitement is building there's no way that we don't have scrambled eggs inside here right it's  what oh my
God are you serious we're having omelets tonight
