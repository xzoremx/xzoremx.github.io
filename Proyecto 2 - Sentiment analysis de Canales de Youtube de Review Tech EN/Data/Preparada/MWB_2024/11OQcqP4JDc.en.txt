this is what happens when I turn on notifications for every single app when I first started this YouTube channel 13 years ago I would get an email every single time someone subscribed but by "the time I hit 10,000 it started to get" a little Mar I still wanted to see every single notification but doing so meant I was getting pinged at all hours of the day I had to disable them however now just for science let's see what happens if I enable them now that we have a Twitter a Tik Tok an Instagram and not
one but two YouTube channels totaling over 20 million subscribers okay so I think everything is on we're going to disable Do Not Disturb mode in 3 2 1 there's literally just comments that say 300 people lik your photo oh my watch is pinging too it's absolutely wild to think that every single time I'm getting one of those pings that's one of you guys writing a comment or leaving a like oh and wait I can see new YouTube comments coming in every 2 seconds this is absolutely crazy and I'm just
imagining being able to hand these phones to me 10 years ago I would have been very proud thank you
