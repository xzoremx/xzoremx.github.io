$50 fake iPhone $400 fake iPhone how close can they get to the real thing at "$1,200 starting with the $50 one" underneath the phone you've got a cable plug earphones even a clear case with included screen protector then the phone man the amount of plastic film on this thing let's unbox the $400 F Well the packaging went from blank box to Super convincing the $50 one feels a lot cheaper than the real it doesn't have an Apple logo everything is made of plastic and look at the cameras only one of
those is real the $400 fake feels very similar like even down to the glass on the back and the shiny metal rails on the sides so this is the $50 phone it does feel pretty budget the animations aren't nearly as smooth this bottom bezel is absolutely massive abomination of a dynamic Island happening on top and the camera yikes is that the Samsung gallery logo the $400 fake is a lot more convincing much more bearable bezels around the sides a much higher quality screen too the dynamic Island looks less
like an April fall show you even have the same swipe down to search let's find out the quality of this camera why is that basically just as good that wasn't meant to happen
