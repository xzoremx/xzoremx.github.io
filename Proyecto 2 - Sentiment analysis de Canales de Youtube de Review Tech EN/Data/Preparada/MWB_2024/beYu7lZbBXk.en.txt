these are all the most popular LED gadgets let's find out if they're actually good or not so first up is the deom pixel art speaker it looks like a tiny little desktop computer it actually sounds pretty good to be fair considering the size of the thing underwater disco lights so you press to turn it on and then press again to cycle between the different modes wow that's awesome the glow-in-the-dark t-shirt though allows you to draw on your clothes this entire thing is one massive light sensitive
panel that reacts to the light particles in this UV torch I just probably won't use it because of how quickly it all fades the LED book is a really fitting idea for a reading light every time you open it it's a different color and then if you want to hold it out for more than 90Â° your book do that the LED Cloud feels like a way just to upsell cotton but if we plug it in ooh I think it's the lighting effects that actually really sell the illusion of this being a thundercloud you could just make this at
home how good is the flame diffuser though put it in wo that is extremely realistic looking like having a fire you can touch it's just quite loud and I'm pretty sure it's also leaking
