four times that Tech survived disaster when the actual door of an Alaskan Airlines plane flew off its hinges earlier this year one unlucky passenger's iPhone flew out with it it "fell 16,000 ft but was found 2 days" later still on airplane mode and still working in 2017 a guy called Harry Street accidentally capsized while kayaking and in the struggle to get himself upright lost his GoPro camera until a whopping 4 years later when it was discovered by someone who was working on a local project in that same
river they then uploaded the most recent clip from that camera onto Facebook where gained enough traction for Harry to see it and reclaim his long lost camera but a GoPro surviving lava yeah that happened too Eric storm was busy telling a story on top of an erupting volcano when his GoPro was engulfed by molten lava and completely caught fire when he pulled it out of the lava and he took it home later discovered that it worked the most impressive though has got to be when Tracy kutol tried to film
a lightning storm out of her bedroom window bad idea because in that moment she was struck by lightning but she survived unscarred and so did her iPhone
