I bought the most cursed kitchen gadgets and everyone gets more cursed than the last oh my God the bicycle pizza cutter actually works is two Pizza Cutters in one with a normal pizza cutter you definitely have to go back and forth more times when you need to open your bottles though this is the cap gun this actually works the way I think it's going to work it is going to be an absolute Game Changer it's got magnets on the inside that keeps the cap in the chamber the lemon juice sprayer is very strange so
you apparently screw it into a real lemon and then this is designed to be able to evenly spray that lemon juice across your food it works and of course you can also use it as a refreshing Spritz the caroto is very literally a giant pencil sharpener for your carrot what it actually works and the result is super presentable just that it turns your carrot into a deadly weapon the spaghetti shaped spaghetti spoon is advertised to be the most spectacular way to serve pasta it looks absolutely
terrifying but to be fair wow this thing has some grip
