this is probably the best investment for anyone who's thinking about becoming a content creator it's the hollyland lar M2 microphone kit and it fixes every issue that I've ever had with normal microphones for example this is the really popular $300 DJI mic it's very heavy so it needs a really strong magnet it tugs on your shirt and it droops the hollyland is $150 and9 G you just take the back off and it very easily just snaps to your shirt like that and it just looks like a button oh and also it
actually comes with stickers in case you decide you want to dozz it these work in every single recording situation so if you want to shoot something on a camera plug this in and your audio will just instantly start recording into that clip that your camera is filming you want to use these while recording a clip on your phone you just slip the receiver in you want two people to talk at the same time you take one you give one to your friend and Bulbs your uncle they use laser
antenni which means you can be standing 300 M away from your phone or camera and it will still work the audio quality is exceptional oh yeah 40 hours of battery life
