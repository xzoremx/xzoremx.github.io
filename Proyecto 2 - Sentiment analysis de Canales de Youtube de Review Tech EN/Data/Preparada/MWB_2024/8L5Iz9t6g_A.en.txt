this spray can apparently make anything waterproof so I'm going to see if I can waterproof my entire body so first let me show you how it works with some kitchen roll it's essentially spraying out silicon dioxide which forms an invisible oleophobic barrier on the surface that you're targeting so now leave it to dry for 10 minutes so this is how normal kitchen roll reacts to water it's soaking wear because it's designed to absorb water what about our treated kitchen roll oh my God it
actually works it doesn't matter how much water I put onto that bone dry right now it's time to try on me we're literally going to throw a massive bucket of water all over me so if this works I'll be blown away I should probably take this off so I'm not waterproofing my lungs so this is actually primarily designed for Footwear to extend the lifespan of your shoes and stop you soiling them on the first day now for the moment I've been dreading although the paper towel does give me a little bit of Hope 3 2 1
go did that work so it partially worked but I would not recommend this for clothing
