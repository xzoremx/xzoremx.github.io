you probably know xiaomi for their suspiciously good value smartphones but what you might not have known is the sheer number of other gadgets they make I'm talking smart pillows 3D printers even smart water guns and they're all incredibly well-rated so it's time to test these for ourselves are they actually just the best value for money gadgets that we're not using yet so let's start with xiaomi's motion sensor NightLight which I men get for $9 and honestly this feels like such a win I've
used a lot of motion lights before but never built like this so instead of the light being the thing that sticks onto your surface it's the stand that sticks onto the surface and then your light just magnetically attaches to the stand which is absolutely amazing because it means if you wanted to put this motion light on a bedside table put it like this if you wanted to clip it to a wall using its side you clip it like this if you wanted to put onto your ceiling facing downward you clip it like this so
I'm going to see how close I need to get to get to that light for it to turn on what on Earth I must be at least 5 me away from it that is easily two times the range of any other NightLight I've used this is actually so perfect for either drawers that get a little bit too dark or just sticking it in a bathroom so that when you got to go at night you can see without vaporizing your retinas by turning on your main light look at this you can even mess around with the settings on the xiaomi app so this is
how bright the light gets this is how long the light stays lit up for after it's been triggered that is actually a complete steal for $9 I think we're going to get one of these for every bedroom in the house 9.5 out of 10 moving up to $30 now this is the company's portable electric kettle which is quite a unique idea I don't think I've ever seen something quite like it before so it's like a thermos it keeps your warm drinks warm they're claiming for about 6 hours but the interesting
thing is that when you plug the thing in it turns into a kettle that can actually do the boiling thing so minimalized I can't find the onr oh it's doing it and it's really fast you can actually see it climbing pretty much every second so the temperature increase does start to slow down as it reaches boiling point it's getting there but it's taking just as long to boil one cup of water as a normal Kettle would take to boil like four I mean it's quite well thought out you know it's got steam vents here which
you do want with a kettle I love the fact that it has a screen on it and it actually does add value and apparently I really hope this works it doesn't leak when it's upside down or shaking around  work I saw one robe droplet which to be fair this temperature could be enough to cause a problem I don't know this product feels like a bit of a Miss to me cuz like you wake up in the morning you make your coffee at home you take it to work and it's still hot because it's in your thermos
so why do you need it to be a kettle I mean maybe if you live on your own this would be quite a nice size just to boil enough water for one person but then only if you never plan on having friends over it's not even like you can use it for camping cuz where are you going to get a main socket from feels like a 5 out of 10 to me very competent I just don't get it now let's skip ahead of it all the way to the xiaomi 3D printer just so that we can get this bad boy running while we test the other products
and I have got to say that looks really cool so you might know that the vast majority of basic home 3D printers are filament printers which means you load them up with plastic they have a heater which melts that plastic deposits it in its new Arrangement and then that plastic dries as it calls but this uses liquid resin cartridges yeah chic confirm definitely not solid so you load this resin into the machine and if you look closely you'll see the machine is peppered with
tiny little bulbs those emit ultraviolet light which causes a chemical reaction in this resin fluid and that causes this resin to solidify in position and this is meant to be better than filament printers in a lot of ways because it can create 3D objects without that horrible wiry finish that you get from the way that filament printers work so let's find a model that we like the look of oh this is cool actually get it to print a vase oh doesn't this look just adorable oh wow so you can fully preview the 3D
model of the thing that you're about to print before you hit go just to make sure you're happy with it from every angle oh my God it actually shows you all the supporting structures that it's going to have to build as well to create that model and it's highlighted them in Gray so you know the bits that you're going to have to snap off once the model's made as well as giving you like a full Dimension map of the model this is actually so consumer friendly for what can often be a very complex and
daunting process I guess that means print says open a window that's not really going to be an option in here oh really cool mechanism for this self adjusting arm oh look it's bubbling away so it's releasing resin into the chamber I have a feeling this is going to take a little bit of time to make so we'll come back to this now this one is easily one of xiaomi's most well-received products ever I've heard a lot about this considering it's a cordless screwdriver which also happens to be the winner of
the if design award oh moly I mean I'm not a massive hey come look at my toolbox kind of guy but this I can see the appeal of it's so pretty it charges via USBC which is absolutely awesome compared to the micro USB or Worse still proprietary battery packs that some others use it's really clean you can't actually fittingly I suppose see a single screw in sight on the design and I love the way that it stores these little drill bits the only thing that concerns me is doesn't sound all that
powerful actually let's test Theory so this is a cabinet we were assembling earlier for the house and this is about as strenuous a task as I've needed a screwdriver before yes construction is my passion the drill bits magnetically clip onto the screwdriver and then when you hold the trigger while it's in neutral you get a ring light so that your screws are twitch stream ready and then you flip the dial to the right screw stuff in and then you flick it to the left to you unscrew stuff so I guess if I want
to take this out this is like child to play for it this honestly feels like another easy 9 out of 10 it is every single thing that a screwdriver needs to be for 95% of people apart from being able to stand up on its own why did I do that but clearly xiaomi was not done cooking because after this thing came out and it was such a success they went ahead and topped it with the Precision screwdriver which looks an awful lot like a power  camera it's like the feeling when you're
really thirsty and you crack open an ice cold can of coat and then on the inside the Precision screwdriver is well a lot thinner it's as the name suggests more precise so you could use this to take apart a watch or a smartphone and it lasts even longer this thing does 180 screws per charge which is already enough for like an entire home's worth of Ikea furniture this can do 400 every single one of these draw bits magnetically attaches into the case oh show me it's fair to say these will be
the screwdrivers that we keep around the new house I feel like I could write with this probably actually could oh yeah y you can so far at least I got to say this stuff is really good I actually think I like xiaomi's gadgets more than I like their phones but let's see if that continues with these smart laser measure so first impression the hardware is very much like the screwdriver in that it feels like it's exactly what it needs to be and nothing more so the whole thing is one button you put the
measure somewhere you tap that one button it fires out a laser and then a receiver sitting on the measure will tell you how far away that laser stops okay so 0.563 okay tape me hey so I'm getting that as 0.56 2 A2 is bang on you can then double tap that button and it changes whether you're including the length of the body or just measuring from the end which is quite important because let's say you're trying to measure the length of a wall and the way that you're doing that is by
placing this on one of the ends then to get the full me of the wall you would need to include however much space this takes up PR yes you are 1.58 M away from you right now okay I'm going to keep going back you're oh yeah you're 4.47 8 m from me right now it's God thing is the range is actually enormous this thing can actually measure anything up to 40 m away and it's only now that I'm realizing just how far that actually is you'd never need more than that that's awesome Jo do you want to know how far
away you are from me you are 1.85 3 m from me what you going to say tall and not like not far off one they yeah still a gr lad this is all good stuff sure but the question on my mind is what makes this a smart laser measure the xiaomi app this is actually really cool because the xiaomi app that controls this is the same xiaomi app that also connects to the motion lights and just about every other xiaomi product also look at this there must be like 100 different categories of products in here and if I
click on just one of them like water heaters oh my God this this say water heaters anyways what does it allow you to do on this so you can store your measurements I guess that's handy and how you can attach labels to those measurements so that you can refer back to them at any time you share your measurements with your friends I'll do everyone's shaking their heads at me so it's got a calculator oh it allows you to input all of your previous measurements taken on this and add them
subtract them multiply them divide them to get fast calculations of let's say the area of the room you're measuring yeah really clever drawing measurements oh my God whoa wait so so if I take a measurement oh my God this is so cool so all the measurements I've ever taken with this are at the bottom here and I can just draw lines and then assign those lines to the measurements I've taken it builds the top down view of the room you're trying to measure and it's exactly to scale I feel like a lot of
this stuff is not hard to implement once you've had the idea to implement it but it's the fact that they've had the idea and crammed it into such a minimalist device that requires no thought to use that's the impressive part I have no notes this is a 10 out of 10 product what not the first 10 you've ever given maybe xiaomi smart clock is another product that if it is actually good could well be perfect for this house it could even be a permanent main stay on our bedside tables so at its call it's a
clock tells the time if you hold down on the clock you get 10 different clock V to choose from and then within each one you can customize the colors of them do you know what's particularly impressive about this though is how smooth the interface is like actually slicker than most phones at $50 and then all these other screens are other basic smartphone like features for example weather traffic calendar music from Spotify scroll down play  Spotify okay I mean it's not a Hi-Fi
speaker but there's plenty of thump here you could happily listen to your morning tunes and not be upset let's try something a little more challenging hey  on that was easy turn off the light that's not bad at all H so actually quite capable smart home functionality too you're getting a lot of product here for something that doesn't really cost a whole lot more than like this not to mention the ritual like routines you can set so for example I can set off an entire a chain reaction
just by saying good morning good afternoon the time is 3:30 p.m. currently in ilford it's 15° and cloudy today it'll be cloudy here's a joke to start your morning what do you get when  investigator have a great day makes me want to go back to  oh so welcome to my morning routine guys the only real downside is I would say the display it's LCD not OLED so unlike a modern top end OLED screen which will make black pixels completely black this thing will still emit a little bit of a
glow at night still it does everything that it's trying to do really quite capably 8.5 out of 10 at $75 now we have xiaomi's monitor light bar which is super interesting to me because we have a really clear point of reference back in the old house I used to use a monitor light bar by then Q I talked a lot about how much I loved it in my perfect desktop video but this xiaomi one is less than half the price of it so if it actually is just as good then Game Changer so the reason that I love these
lights so much is because unlike normal desk lamps they don't take up any desk space they don't need a means plug they just use the USB on the back of your monitor and they are specifically designed to just light up your desk avoiding both your eyes and your screen so as not to introduce glare that's actually really satisfying I love this little thing I will say this wireless remote is a little bit on the light side which means that it's not completely stable on a flat surface unlike the Ben
q1 but you've got to love how aggressively minimalist the thing is you can't see a single button and the controls are as simple as just rotate the dial to adjust your level of brightness and then press and rotate to adjust the color temperature that said there are two really important features that I'm realizing this doesn't have that my BenQ light did one that even though you can change your color temperature here the old light used to actually do that automatically throughout the day so when you're
working during the day you have lots of blue light to keep you awake and then in the evenings you have less of it so that you can start to wind down and that light also had a second light on the back to shine onto the wall behind your monitor which further reduces your IE strain by equalizing the brightness of the scene you're looking at so I would say there is a place for this product if you just want a really clean desk lamp but it's not the full shebang 6 out of 10 let's just check on this 3D printer
copy wow that is so cool it looks like Shrek emerging from the swamp and it's saying it is 67% done not long to go now so far with all these affordable xiaomi products I think it's fair to say the value for money has been absolutely insane but now that we're going into the $100 plus luxury tier with their perfume dispenser my question is does the value for money start to deteriorate so again I will say they have knocked it out the park when it comes to design so it's powered by plugging it into your car's
USB port and to be honest the cable being so short and thin kind of disappears it's very elegant I love how this just like every other Gadget here has a USBC connector and the glowing ring that shows you which scent is currently being released oh la la so green is meant to be freshness it kind of smells like walking through the forest just after it's rained in a nice way purple is meant to be soothing does this smell like body soap smells really like a hotel does it does it smells like
a it smells like a hotel lobby yeah says checkin that's what this is and then orange is meant to be Joy I think it smells like oranges oh look you can see it it's got a like wispy little performance here o wow okay yeah it's actually kind of potent really full of joy I got to say it's a pretty smart little Gadget while it's on it will sporadically release scent and then stop and then release more as it's needed it will remember what setting you left it on when you turn the car off and on
again I way prefer the idea of something like this as opposed to the little hanging trees people get here or whatever the hell this thing is can I check the capacity of the cartridges oh yeah look so it's telling me they're all on 100% right now we actually left this running outside for an hour yesterday and so the fact that it's still saying 100% makes me think this will last quite a long time so this to me feels unlike some other xiaomi products not the cheap way of doing things this is like the
most expensive way possible to perfume your car but do you still get what you pay for yes absolutely this is one sexy way to make your car smell good 8.5 out of 10 now the massage gun is another chance for xiaomi to make something just as good for L considering that this thing is $120 whereas some massage guns I've used are $500 ooh this is some nice  peel wow that was not nearly as satisfying as it should have been first thing that occurs to me it's actually kind of cool that xiaomi's design
language is so consistent that the massage gun B basically just looks like a scaled up version of their screwdriver just you know don't get them mixed up you got three different heads you got a ball head that's somewhat cushioned you  you so it's meant to have a super quiet brushless motor oh yeah I I can't even why do you need this fair play though it is very quiet considering what it's able to do although not so much when you start to turn the settings up wow that's amazing though it's almost
like it's reaching ultrasonic speeds it's actually going so fast that I don't even feel like I'm getting peled anymore I just feel like really deep releas but then also it has a smart pressure sentor built in so you actually have to push a certain amount till it lights up white which means that you're pushing the right am out and then it's meant to go red when you're putting in too much but ow ow there's got to be the limit tell me to stop that point I might as well just use
the screwdriver so the ball head will definitely be more forgiving than than whatever this is so if I use that instead I should be able to show the pressure sensing ah see that's nice so you can see when I put a normal amount of pressure on it goes weight and then when I put too much pressure it will eventually come out  okay well I would probably discount the smart pressure sensor as a feature you'll be banking on and that's basically it it's fairly simple but it's not exactly lacking in features I know
some high-end th guns have like red light therapy and a proper screen to allow you to configure your settings completely but this does actually feel just as high quality and the massage it gives you is very much as thorough which is an achievement for something a quarter of the price and also the heat dissipation mechanism here is completely concealed so nothing gets inside of this even if you get a little sweaty while using it can't think why that might be it's actually kind of crazy because this
xiaomi massage gun is actually less expensive than like a Theon mini and this gives you a far better massage than this does it's just that i' still probably prefer to use this on the regular because this actually fits into a small side pocket of my backpack the xiaomi does not so I'll go an 8 out of 10 bolstered by the fact that it has an insane 13 hours of battery life now on first burns the sh we pillow doesn't look like a product that even belongs in a tech video it is very soft like
genuinely this might be the comfiest pillow I've ever interacted with but when you look at it it's not particularly clear what makes it smart I it's got this weird alien looking dongle thing coming out of it but that's because almost the entirety of the pillow's functionality is based on the app so the thing's got a bunch of absolutely tiny millimeter scale sensors baked inside of it to measure changes in pressure temperature strain and and acceleration for anyone who's training
for a marathon in their sleep I guess and it basically uses all these sensors to give you almost all of the same data that you would get from an Apple Watch or an aura ring or a whoop band while being more affordable and also very comfy with its zero cotton material made with a natural vegetable oil extract is that vegetable by any chance spring onion it anyways I actually tested it last night so I slept on this and I also wore the Apple Watch series 10 at the same time so let's compare statistics oh
dear so the Apple watch is saying I slept for 8 hours and 40 minutes and it says I fell asleep at yeah 16 midnight that seems about right the xiaomi pillow is telling me I slept 6 hours and 26 and that I was awake until 3:00 a.m. no I wasn't okay so given that I've tested this quite a bit and it has been accurate in the past and given that I do not remember being awake for the first 3 hours of my sleep I don't think it would be very wise to trust the answers this thing gives you but at the same time man
when I look at the xiaomi app and I see the thousands of products that can all neatly tie together into this one ecosystem it is so tantalizing the idea that I could have a smart pillow that when I wake up in the morning directly communicates to my smart blinds to tell them to open without even needing any kind of middle layer because they're part of this one app is so cool but yeah not too sure about this particular pillow 4 out of 10 now I've tested quite a few water guns in my time cheap guns
fancy guns but never one quite as ridiculous as xiaomi I'm struggling to wrap my head around how a water gun can be worth $250 so let's get testing oh it charges with USBC of course nice turn it on wa I didn't realize that's an LED stroke that is so cool so then you stick it in the water you push the trigger forward  you can actually see the water filling up using the Neds room that's such a clever way to use what would otherwise be a gimmick oh yeah and then the screen also tells you how much of your water
full probably got outside so obviously it is cooler than every other water gun but is it actually better cuz I just bought this for $15 and it's still electric I'm just going to shoot drisha this the second time that I've been shot in a video yeah but see so we've moved house and I left the kind of dummy at home that I was going to use and I don't do this for me I do this for the content okay so where would you like to be you know you can choose choose where you'd like to be
anywhere thank you for offering yourself for this cause Okay so this is a normal  gun it looks like it's barely reaching you yeah it's like a like a garden sprinkler but to be fair rate of fire impressive I'll just carry on trying to and that's basically it for this gun there's no alternate fire modes I mean technically there's an optical scope I don't think it's going to get you very far so that leads us to this so first thing you notice is a display like an actual fairly high resolution circular
display and that shows you the fire mode you're on so if I click this rather unusually named mode Swit button on the side it will take me between single fire mode and burst fire mode so same distance you tell me how much you feel this okay okay I felt that one you felt that 0 to 10 I I felt that like an an eight okay like an eight so let me try burst fire oh God okay okay okay that's pretty cool like a water bullet I think it's definitely coming apart as it's approaching you so it's not like when
you pay $250 for a water gun you're suddenly getting sniper like accuracy at a distance so from what I've understood if I now hold down the trigger I can actually charge up a super bullet of sorts okay let's see so hold down You See This Bar filling up tells me I'm ready to go okay okay it feels like I should feel the impact cuz it's coming so fast yeah it's just yeah it just kind of sprays out yeah it's not  yeah all I'm getting okay it's getting it it's definitely more powerful it's getting
more it's more powerful that's all I want Sor I'm trying to avoid your microphone it feels like the kind of product that is so far beyond what you would normally expect to pay for a water gun that this isn't about being good value for money it's not good value for money it's if you want the best of the best this is that 8 out of 10 a look whoa what are you doing up there buddy that looks incredibly cursed so you meant to unscrew this pull it out like so I got swamp on my hand
wow and we're left with the cutest fell you've ever seen now there are two downsides I can think of one that you've got to use these xiaomi only proprietary single use resin cartridges after which you throw them which it's not particularly environmentally friendly but then also it smells really bad I've actually been holding my nose for the last 45 seconds and we're probably going to need some industrial great stuff to clean this room up still though this is a way better result than I've ever seen
come from a filament printer 8 and now for the flagship Big Daddy xiaomi product this is the one that I'd say xiaomi has the biggest Market penetration in the electric scooter I see these things all the time on the screets but this is their new scooter 4 Pro and my clumsiest unboxing ever oh there we go again nearly face planted the first thing you notice is this is quite a bit taller than the average electric scooter which is great for me because I'm usually ever so slightly
trained over and also the base feels wider it's like the extra leg room seats on a plane let's take it for a spin I'm a little scared for the acceleration holy wow I've tested electric scooters before never before with that much oomph oh I'm A Hazard To Myself and Society with this so I know that the speed of electric scooters is capped in most countries for your own safety that doesn't mean this thing can't accelerate and then when you run out of battery this is another massive Improvement the
charger is magnetic which is really important for something so valuable because it means if you accidentally walk on by it that nearly hit you I'm sorry your scooter is still standing I mean the thing even has regenerative braking which is what electric cars use to recover some of their energy when you hit the brakes which is what's actually increasing this thing's range from 45 km last generation to 55 km this generation squeeze me w I mean this wo has to be the most polished refined
high-tech electric scooter out there even the lights on the front and the back are extremely bright there's reflectors all over for visibility on roads and it's just such a smooth ride and part of the reason why is these tires they're bigger which is good for shock absorption but they're also made of dura gel that's apparently also self-sealing if you get a puncture what as if I needed to make this any more hazardous for myself this is a plank of wood with with a 2in nail sticking out
of it all right off we go oh this could be rip okay that's definitely in there let's go back over let really make sure it's done this is why we can't have nice things here well actually I suppose we can just temporarily I think it's fair to say that's tested so well there's just nothing here so whether the tire has actually broken and self-repaired without me even realizing or has just absorb the entire impact of that nail without even puncturing that is one durable piece of Kit so I got to
say I'm personally more of a bike person I like the idea of if I'm not using a car and having the most convenient way to get somewhere then at least I'm getting some exercise while I'm at it but if you're looking for a scooter then this is everything it needs to be and more 10 out of 10 and I will catch you in the next one woohoo oh my God
