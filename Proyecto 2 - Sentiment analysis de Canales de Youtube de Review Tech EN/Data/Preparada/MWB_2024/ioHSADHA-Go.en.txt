"$1 lightsaber all the way to a $2,500" lightsaber starting with the $1 actually have to inflate it first does this make you feel like a true Jedi Master feel like I'm fine for $10 you get proper thick plastic it's retractable so you can go like this and you can go like this and of course LEDs every single time the saber makes contact it changes color huh but it takes $100 to get something that looks like it could do real damage the attention to detail is way higher it's
got inbuilt motion sensors which play sound as you swing at $500 then this is metal wo this is responsive to a whole of level I feel like I could take on the dark side myself oh nearly the "$25,000 saber though leavs that one in" the dust this is an actual spinning kyber Crystal plus an LCD display at its core it figures out exactly how fast it's moving and adjusts it sound accordingly I ripped him in half and that's how it done
