this is the most expensive bed in the world it's called the Grand vividus and it goes up to a million dollars depending on the size you get oh yeah and it's also the bed that Drake uses okay so there's three parts to this the base the mattress the topper and inside of them there's basically just many many layers of cotton wool Springs and then in between all of it loads of horse hair yes I said HSE hair because this company has decided that HSE hair is the best material to both Wick away moisture but
also act as tiny little springs that all create this supportive structure so in a sense there are very literally millions of Springs in this bed it takes 600 hours to make this there's only 15 people in the world who can actually do it and they went absolutely nutty with the material this right here is stingray leather this can apparently completely remove sleeping noises it can give you the perfect sleeping posture and apparently allow you to feel awake for the first time in your life so let's try it 3 2
1 feel like I've been given a 360 degree hug this is absolutely bizarre but it feels like I'm both sinking and floating at the same time
