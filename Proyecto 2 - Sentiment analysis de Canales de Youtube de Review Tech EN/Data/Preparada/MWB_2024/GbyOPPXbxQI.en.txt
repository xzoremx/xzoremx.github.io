this tiny Gadget could change the way you see the world it's called the imicro Q3 and it's a brand new fingertip sized "microscope with a whopping 1, 200 times" magnification it's pretty cool that it comes in basically a business card so you could always keep it in your wallet and then the lens just sticks to your phone's camera using a nano suction pad so it's actually shockingly easy to take off put back on and be sure it's not going to fall now I've tested plenty of microscopes before but never close to
1200 times so let's try this Leaf here we need to make it as bright as possible when you're zooming in this much oh my goodness this is another level let's try it with a flower wow it is absolutely Bonkers how close you need to get for this thing to focus you wouldn't even think that this exists inside a flower oh obviously what about a phone screen wow you can see the entire Matrix of pixels okay this is a video of something sitting within this Frame right now can you see what it is 3 2 one what my
