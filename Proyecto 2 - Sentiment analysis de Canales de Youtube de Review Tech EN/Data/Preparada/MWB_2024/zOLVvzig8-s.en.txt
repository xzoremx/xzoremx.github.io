the new Apple pencil Pro is absolutely Bonkers for starters there's pressure sensitivity so if I draw really lightly it comes out like this if I push harder it looks like this there's barrel roll which means that you know how with a normal pencil or a highlighter you can kind of rotate it in your hands to get different parts of the tip yep it's basically the same here you can hover so you'll be able to see where you're about to make a mark before you actually do but also do you see the shadow yeah
that's not actually real this is a software Shadow created specifically to reassure you that you are about to write where you think you're about to write but pretty cool considering the shadow even changes based on what tool has been selected but this is my favorite bit you see this neck here anywhere from about here to here well you can squeeze it to bring up your menu it's pretty trippy cuz there's no actual button here it's just pressure sensors combined with a little vibration motor up top that gives
you that little bump when you placed enough pressure to make it feel like you have clicked something and then the added perk of that is double tap to quickly flick between two options without even needing the menu
