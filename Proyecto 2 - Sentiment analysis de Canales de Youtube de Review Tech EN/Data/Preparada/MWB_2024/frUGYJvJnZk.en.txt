normal whistle all the way to the loudest whistle in the world this thing cost 50 cents and you can kind of tell wow that's surprisingly loud already the $6 hand whistle though works by squeezing this pouch to force air through the whistle oh shorter and sharper the $60 Tesla cyber whistle it feels about 10 times heavier thanks to medical grade stainless steel the volume is only slightly louder than the $6 one the ref swistle though is designed for professional refereeing
apparently the range of this thing is up to a mile that was distinctly more powerful the emergency hurricane whistle to Next Level it generates three different tones at the same time you project your sound over greater distances this thing is designed to save your life so it needs that power but none of these is as loud as the hyper whistle which has a 2 mile range and even works underwater I'm wearing ear protection and that nearly deafened me
