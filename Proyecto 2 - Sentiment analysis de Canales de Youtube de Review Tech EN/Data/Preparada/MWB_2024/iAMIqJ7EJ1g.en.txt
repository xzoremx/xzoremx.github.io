did you ever see the Mr Beast video that was trending on Tik Tok last year someone had created a deep fake of him and was using it to tell viewers that "10,000 of them could get an iPhone 15" Pro for just $2 which is exactly the kind of crazy thing that he might actually do but there were no iPhones this was a scam that many people fell for so this is what they should have done they should have added sco this video sponsor as a contact on their phone I've added it to Whatsapp but you
can also add it to Facebook or just add it to your web browser and it's 100% free and all it does is takes whatever you send it analyzes it and then messages you back to say if it's a scam or not and yeah look at this so it takes a total of about 10 seconds for scam to look at that image and tell you that this Mr Beast giveaway ain't the one and you know that you can trust this tool because it is built by Bit Defender these guys have a huge R&amp;D department and they're discovering 487 new Cyber
threats every minute and ever since I set up sco about 2 months ago I've been using it all the time for any email that looks a little bit Dodge or just before I click a link that looks like it might lead me to a bad place it's an elite tier tool
