this is the largest iPhone in the world and it has a hidden feature so obviously because it's a phone you can do phone things like open up a cheeky game of Geometry Dash oh my God this game is ridiculously difficult jump jump jump no one saw that you can do a little bit of social media like this is Instagram and well this is me and you can take a selfie although you do need to move like 10 m back before you actually fit in the photo but because this isn't a phone on the inside and is actually a very
high-end gaming PC it can actually run full windows too this is just crazy I actually can't believe we can do this so you can literally have a four player game of Rocket league on an 8K 88 in screen standing in the middle of a street
