this is my new drone and yes we have basically merged to become one being how well a couple of days ago I received a box in the mail the brand new DJI of V 2 and it became pretty clear to me that this is not a normal drone this is a firstperson view drone which means you can pilot it with a motion controller and I know it looks like a complicated piece of tech but the thing that was most shocking to me is it just feels like playing a game on the Wii like if I do this it moves with me but then you
put the DJI goggles 3 on your face and that's where it properly clicks cuz this kind of feels like using an apple Vision Pro I can see what's around me thanks to the cameras on the outside but because I can also see the view from the Drone it's like an apple Vision Pro if I could detach my eyes and send them flying 13 km into the air it gives me the new option for easy Acro which means that with one button I'm doing Top Gun level stunts oh and the drone's video is also Tac sharp with a 1 over 1.3 in sensor
that can shoot 4K resolution at 60 frames per second
