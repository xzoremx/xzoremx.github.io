so this is the old iPad Pro and this is the brand new M4 iPad Pro and this is magnet paper so a couple things to notice there's obviously tons and tons of little magnets arranged throughout an iPad Pro when you get down to the side here these little rectangular slot shaped magnets I noticed on this new iPad Pro again tons of magnets in lots of the same places but over here on the side they're bigger and uh more cubic now but then famously these big ovals are the quad speakers on the iPad Pro
you can see all four of them on the new one which is thinner they've had to fit these different big circular speaker drivers and they're super super obvious which I think means they're closer to the top I actually think my favorite new accessory is this new folio case which has this like sliding angle of adjustment so the way they did this very cleverly was by adding these new stripe magnets this big rail of magnets through the back of this case having a single magnet line up with that also in case
you're wondering here's an overlay of all the magnets in the old iPad Pro versus the new iPad Pro for science
