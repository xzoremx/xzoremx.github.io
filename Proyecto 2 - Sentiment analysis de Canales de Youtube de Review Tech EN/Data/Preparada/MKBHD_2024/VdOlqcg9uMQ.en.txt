budget phones are fun because pretty much with all of them if you poke around hard enough you will find the thing that they had to cut corners on you'll find the thing that they trimmed back to get it to be a budget phone and so for picking one for you it's just a matter of like picking the one that makes the tradeoffs that you're okay with like maybe you love you got to have good build quality and cameras well then iPhone SE is probably a good one for you and then you know you're not going to
get a great screen or battery life or things like that or maybe you got to have a great big screen Samsung makes the Galaxy a54 or maybe you got to have good software and cameras pixel 7A this phone is 350 bucks and this this is the designer  one so this phone is not going to win anyone over with raw specs it's not going to win by having the best camera or the best battery life of any budget phone the performance isn't going to blow you out of the water but you could definitely argue that it's the prettiest
$350 phone so nothing has had this transparent aesthetic going for a while with their phones and then also the earbuds this one definitely also has that there's also a white version of this I think it looks better uh it also has like black buttons so it's kind of this nice contrast but you know dark version looks cool too and honestly if the mission is to look like a nothing phone and not be mistaken for anything else then yeah Mission definitely accomplished the dual cameras in the
middle near the top is pretty unique kind of like a pair of eyes maybe and the NFC coil actually surrounds the cameras then there are three bars of LEDs making a glyph design around the camera Circle again then it's kind of this split design the bottom half is like a PCB inspired look apparently inspired by the New York City subway map and nothing's already shown people this like there's been some reactions to the design already some people love some people actually hate it I don't know
it's a bit asymmetrical so it's unconventional for sure but I think it's nice not going to lie but even if you don't like it at least you can say it's at least somewhat visually interesting you know there's some textures there's some exposed screws and some text and that little red square it's not functional it's just purely to look cool so I appreciate that and if you do like this look but have maybe a more boring phone that you're not willing to give up then Channel sponsor dbrand has you
covered with their something skins so if you haven't heard of it already dbrand has performed some and these are their words not mine creative plagiarism on nothing's whole design language both in light mode and dark mode so I'll leave a link below if you want to check those out but guess what it's an extremely competitive price bracket so you you get a good- looking phone but you still will have to make some sacrifices to get it so first of all it's clear plastic not glass at the back which you know I'm
sure Zach will get to this phone at some point but I think it'll be easier to scuff and scratch but harder to shatter like glass would be so but I think it's a reasonable trade-off it's also a textured plastic frame as well so it looks like aluminum but it's this plastic all the way around the phone to the point where this phone actually ends up feeling surprisingly light in the hand for how big it is but we should we should just get to that this is a huge it's a jumbo siiz phone it's gigantic
some people might not love that but I think a lot of people like really big screens and you get the natural advantages that come with a big phone which is a big battery and a big screen so this is a relatively giant 6 7 in display corner to corner it's it's literally Ultra phone size and it gets pretty bright too so definitely not Flagship bright because we have some crazy numbers these days but 1300 nits Peak brightness is very visible in bright indoor lighting and bezels are
even all the way around the front of the phone so aesthetically I have no complaints and then even at this price it's AMOLED it has an optical fingerprint reader under the glass its variable refresh rate up to 120 HZ and it even has 2160 HZ pwm dimming so if you don't like the back of this phone at least the front of it that you're actually looking at all the time is pretty impressive for 350 bucks but I'd say an even bigger strength of this phone is battery life so battery always
comes from like three main things basically obviously having a huge physical battery also good software and an efficient chip we'll get to the "software but this phone has a 5,000 mlia" battery that's literally bigger than their Flagship phones from nothing so really big battery it doesn't have wireless charging but it it does have 45 wat wire charging which is pretty good that's zero to full in an hour and the chip it's running is this little thing called the mediatech dimensity
7200 Pro so this was my biggest question mark actually going into testing this phone because you know how nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time so we find out it's a mediatech chip and I'm not sure if this one's going to perform the way I've been used to some other phones like they're showcasing all these you know specifically handpicked benchmarks Mar results of course they will but conveniently they only compare it to a 2-year-old nothing phone 1 which had that mid-range 778 G+ from Qualcomm
now I'm not expecting Flagship stuff for 350 bucks but like what what's it going to land at this feels like a make or break part of the phone and I've been pleasantly surprised now it's not going to win any prizes with raw specs and I definitely don't think it'll earn anybody's money with the benchmark scores alone you look at those numbers you're like okay not a total shock here but as far as actual performance when you use the phone the way I'd put it is it's respectable and I really feel like
that is a testament to the software and how well it's working together so at this point we're on nothing OS 2.5 on top of Android 14 and you already have seen nothing phone software with the dots and the aesthetic and all that stuff but it's clean there's no bloat Weare and there is a solid focus on fast and smooth it kind of feels like a like a throwback to the the old OnePlus magic back in the day but with regular use this phone is quite smooth and snappy sometimes the fingerprint reader
shutters a little bit like when you're first unlocking but for the most part if you're just using the phone doing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple apps email web browsing taking your pictures this is a smooth phone it's pretty similar to what they did with the nothing phone one with the 778 it's it's very solid with everyday use and the second you try to do super high-end stuff like gaming then you'll see where the benchmarks come up short where you start dropping frames and all
that but again this is a $350 phone and I am definitely not complaining about that now nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic and their identity and what they really want a nothing phone to be and I got to say they have a lot of unique really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike but they're all here so aesthetically they've got the dots everywhere so the stock apps have this dots aesthetic and the thin font go with it the back arrow
in Android is made of these dots and they have this extensive built out selection of nothing widgets now most of them with the dots theme as well so you can have this very consistent home screen aesthetic and then there's other little stuff like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid I don't know you might be into that there's also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen also this new thing which lets
you add a glass effect to your wallpaper so it's blurred behind your home screen for better visibility I actually really like that there's also AI wallpapers now so you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen in just a few Taps there's also third-party icon pack support on the home screen with instant OneTouch previews and then of course the glyphs so this phone still has some lights on the back it's less lights than the flagship than the the
phone 2 but about the same amount of function it so there's one vertical light on the right and a small one down here on the bottom left and then the big top one arcing around the top left this is the one that works with the glyph countdown timer maybe you'll find that useful the blinking notification glyph when your phone is down I still wish I could just customize it a little bit more I know they don't want to do RGB but if this was RGB I would totally have different colors light up for different
app notifications and I would go to town with that but you know it still works with just white lights and it also does music visualization to syn up with any music coming out of  so I don't know sure obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks some of this you may find useful like once or twice I almost never use the countdown clock but the one time I use it it's kind of cool side note I couldn't get the glyph composer to work at all on this phone the UI worked but it didn't light up the lights on the
back but you know on super close-up photos maybe the glyph fill flash is decently useful sometimes useless other times but hey while we're on the subject the camera the cameras on the back here are serviceable like it it's just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone and these they're not good but they're fine I always feel like we go into budget phone reviews kind of knowing okay this isn't going to have cameras that blow me away it's not going to be as interesting to test these but
you got to test them anyway and see what they're made of so this has a different new 50 megapixel primary camera on the back and it has the same Ultra wide camera as the nothing phone 2 and actually also the same selfie camera and look it can take okay pictures all right passible pictures I know 50 megapixels is a big number but here's what I'll say at this level even in great lighting the photos aren't particularly sharp the dynamic range or depth of field aren't amazing like you're not buying this
phone to take the greatest most artistic photos and videos the world has ever seen but what you do need is for it to be serviceable to be quick enough for autofocus to work for it to capture a moment document scanning video calls sharing photos with people and it does all that and it's totally fine and I can't complain and really what's left a bigger imprint on me using this is that compared to their other Flagship phones almost all of the features are still here like the only one I'm not actually
seeing on this budget version of the phone is macro mode and that that theme of keeping a lot of the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these like artificial Cuts that's what feels good about this phone as a budget phone to me it it actually feels like they're trying to give people all of the nothing phone experience for less money now we definitely can't say it's one to one there's obviously Cuts especially with Hardware like there's no wireless charging like I said it's ip54 instead
of ip68 it's plastic instead of glass and aluminum but I like that once you start to get to use the phone especially with the software features experience-wise I don't feel nearly as many artificial feeling Cuts as we've seen on other phones like there's no PR mode in the camera that's missing from the budget phone uh all the same advanced settings the experimental features all the home screen features with nothing OS it's all here on this cheaper phone and the crazy part to me
is like they obviously want to compare this to a a lower end phone so they they compare it to the phone one and my natural instinct is like I'm ignoring that of course they're comparing it to the old phone but when you actually look at that 2-year-old phone you kind of see how far they've come and you look at the things that are actually better about this budget phone this nothing phone 2A has a bigger brighter screen with thinner bezels it has a larger battery with faster charging a higher processor
clock speed a higher resolution front camera and a wider variety of refresh rates than the phone one like no wonder they want to show us the phone one but in general if you're looking for the tldw yes this is a good solid all-around budget phone uh and the way nothing has been tracking with software it appears I mean they're promising three years of Android updates with this phone I think this will be a good budget phone to own for the next couple years well done nothing well done thanks for watching
catch you guys in the next one peace
