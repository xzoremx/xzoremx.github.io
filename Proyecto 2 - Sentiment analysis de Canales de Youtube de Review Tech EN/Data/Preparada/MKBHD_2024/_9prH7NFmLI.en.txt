so I've made a few references over the past couple years to that time that the FBI visited the studio and I was asked not to talk about that for what I feel like are pretty obvious reasons so for years I haven't but it turns out I am now finally able to tell that story so here we are so for those of you who don't know we have a studio here and it's in a larger building with more tenants in it obviously it's like an office building it's not it's not exactly like an office building but you
know there's a front desk and security and all that and I've been in this building long enough that we have a pretty good relationship with them so we have this one rule basically so there's the guy at security at the front desk we'll call him Bob just for this but Bob and I have this one rule which is that if anyone ever shows up at the front desk and asks for me that he doesn't let them in I have to come out and meet them to confirm that I was expecting them and then I bring them back to our studio so
if someone just randomly shows up which you shouldn't but if they do and I don't show up at the front to meet them then I wasn't supposed to meet them but if I have someone coming and I expect them I meet them outside that's our one rule we stick to it so in June 2020 it was pretty early in this new space that we have and it's also right around like Peak covid so I had sent everybody home and it was just me and Andrew coming into the studio to work on on basically building furniture and making videos and
recording the podcast every week so I got here pretty early on one of those summer mornings and I'm starting to get all my stuff settled and then there's a knock on the door so I open the door and it's our front desk guy Bob and Bob basically says Hey Marquez uh there's some people with badges at the front desk to see you I of course didn't let them in but if you would like to they're up there and then he just walked away and my first thought is confusion like what what did I what did
I do on the way here that someone with badges would show up asking for me I'm I'm a little concerned I'm not sure what to think so there was a solid minute where I just like stood there in the doorway like okay do I go up there or do I just stay here in the studio without asking who the people with badges are i eh and I just I just went up to the front I went up I went up to the front desk and sure enough there's three people with badges there and they walk right up to me and they
all like flash their badges FBI just like the movies like FBI agent this IRS agent this and uh they're like Marquez good to see you uh we've got some questions for you about the Escobar phone so immediately I'm relieved but I'm like oh oh oh the Escobar phone oh oh because see a few months earlier I had published a video about the Escobar fold if you guys haven't seen that video basically the story goes there's this this company parading around and selling this $400 gold folding phone which
they're going to use to destroy Apple and Samsung and they had these insane marketing campaigns and all this but really what they were doing as I uncovered in my video was covering Samsung Galaxy folds cheaply with like gold stickers and then shipping them to YouTubers and people who they believed would talk about it positively and then not shipping any of the other orders from regular people or the audiences that watch those videos those people were getting scammed out of their money and
honestly in hindsight I don't know how they thought they were going to get away with this like it felt pretty obvious to me but you know eventually their whole plan backfired when I made a video about the entire thing so now fast forward a couple months and it actually makes sense that the FBI and the IR s are interested I just didn't I didn't realize they were just going to show up one day but here we are but you know shout out to Bob at the front desk for sticking to our rule even though they he
probably had a bunch of people like flash FBI badges at him he stuck to our Rule and that was great so I appreciate that uh but yeah so I I came out I brought them back to our spot and they basically then had a bunch of questions about that video and the process of dealing with that company in any way like any and all Communications that I had with them any email I'd ever sent or received from them ever they wanted everything and actually it was funny another tidbit is Andrew at the time had
just started running the business email account here and when they were asking like has anybody else on your team possibly ever been in email communication with this company and I was like I think Andrew might have and Andrew just had arrived at the studio and walked up to the front door of our spot and so I like I go hey hey come come in and you know first thing he sees is like me in an empty studio with a bunch of people in suits like waving him over so he has a pretty funny alternate
perspective on the story so the FBI actually took the half peeled Escobar fold and the scratched gold iPhone from my videos as evidence in the case they literally asked for them and took them away they put them in sealed plastic bags that said evidence on them uh which is why I said at the end of the smart awards that year also honorable mention to the Escobar fold 2 which I also don't have on this desk because it is in the possession of the FBI someday I'll be able to tell that story so as they're
leaving you know they've asked me all the questions as the FBI and IRS people are leaving they're they're like hey uh don't talk about this at all publicly please and I'm like of course yeah no obviously you're the FB of I'm not going to talk about it uh I don't want to interfere with the investigation in any way but also like when could I talk about it like how long do you think before I am allowed to and they said we'll let you know so I've been biting my tongue for years not talking about it
hinting at it a little bit but not anything too serious um but since then a lot of The Dominoes have started to fall you know at first when the scam was happening PayPal stopped working with them so they'd switched to this only non-refundable direct transfer thing with Clara and then they stopped working with them too and then eventually the whole operation starts falling down and the guy at the head of IT named Olaf gustofson this guy finally ends up getting arrested and going to prison in
Spain for fraud and money laundering and a bunch of other things basically for everything that I talked about in those videos so I've been holding on to this not really knowing like okay is it cool now that he's Behind Bars to talk about it so we actually reached back out to those same FBI agents um because they left their cards and uh they're like oh yeah no it's cool now to talk about it you're totally fine so there unfortunately is no footage of any of this incident um but there is these
papers which they provided as proof that they received property to be used as evidence in the case so one Pablo Escobar fold 2 mobile flip phone AKA Samsung and one one Pablo Escobar gold 11 Pro mobile phone AKA iPhone 11 Pro but hey now you basically know the story uh yeah pretty serious business out here making videos about phones sometimes you know apparently also uh if this guy Olaf ever does get charged in the United States then uh it's very likely my videos would show up somewhere in those
court documents which is crazy and also the phones that they took May show up as evidence but yeah I do want to get back into a little more of the more investigative Deep dive type of videos obviously the giant scams don't happen very often thankfully in the tech world but still they are fascinating stories when they do by the way that's not the only encounter that we've had with the FBI in running this YouTube channel but that's a that's another story for another day but hey if you want more fun
stories like this one let me know with the comments but also so the latest episode the bonus episode of the waveform podcast is just stories like this one from the past couple years at the studio Whole Story Time episode it's fun so go over there and subscribe and watch that but yeah that's basically it thanks for watching catch you guys in  peace it's a story of how I became uh a villain for at least 24 hours I was I was hated a couple weeks I would say yeah oh really a couple weeks
well cuz the video had to come out hang on here for a second I'm going to go get him I literally wait there with all my bags and stuff and like this guy disappears into this booth comes back out with another guy he goes hi oh good to meet you and he's filming me now okay oh no so now he's filming me couple weeks later I log into YouTube and everyone Twitter's like why is Marquez such a jerk
