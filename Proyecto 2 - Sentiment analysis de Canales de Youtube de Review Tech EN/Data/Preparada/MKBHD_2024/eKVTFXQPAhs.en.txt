down Samsung Galaxy S one of the most popular names in the world of smartphones and has been for years interestingly it's kind of a long name you might be wondering where Galaxy s comes from and if you think you already know what you're thinking is probably wrong apparently Galaxy comes from a wine often enjoyed by highlevel Samsung Executives and then they proceeded to "name like 20,000 phones after it now" here's the thing Samsung will try anything that's kind of their thing like
this is something I've known about them for a long time from reviewing their phones but just from researching for this video like they have a ton of phones in every single imaginable price bracket or feature set or spec sheet here you can even try to guess these they've had a Samsung Galaxy F series what do you think the F stands for stands for fun then there's the Galaxy Z series Z for zero and Galaxy m is you'd think mid-range but it actually stands for Millennial and then Galaxy a that's
some of their most popular affordable smartphones so naturally it stands for Alpha there's galaxy W for Wonder Galaxy R for Royal the list goes on but then the flagship that's lived at the top of with their lineup is the Samsung Galaxy S and S stands for super smart yeah super smart anyway the first ever Samsung Galaxy S comes out in 2010 just to set the scene like this is 3 years after the first ever iPhones come out so the iPhone 4 is about to come out this is a couple months after the Nexus 1
gets unveiled blackberri is quicking in their boots like the entire smartphone industry if you want to call it that is totally in a reshuffling things are up for grabs and it's still very much in its infancy too the second most popular phone selling by volume looks like this it's a Nokia 3720 classic and so Samsung launches the first ever Galaxy S super smart into the world with over two dozen variations this is going to be a bit of a theme here you know it a pretty basic
phone big touchcreen on the front some capacitive buttons a plastic removable back a single camera today we have Samsung Galaxy s24 and it's Ultra refined tightly packed supercomputer in the palm of your hands with high resolution cameras and displays powerful processors AI features like just a ton of optimizations that have stacked up over the years to get to this point so today I've got every single Samsung Galaxy S that has ever been released they're all in front of me actually it's
every main Galaxy S variant from the S1 to the s24 everything in between and I'm going to review them all and and some of them I've reviewed before and others are like the first time I've ever gotten them working on camera but either way it'll be fun to go back and go through this is the story of how we got to where we are today and where it started so buckle up we're going to Jump Right In also stay tuned for the graphs at the end like usual they're super fun so Samsung Galaxy S this is the first one
summer 2010 and yeah it does clearly look old with the classic four capacitor buttons at the bottom Android 2 .1 and it's a micro USB port at the top next to the headphone jack but I feel like right off the bat you can see Samsung differentiating itself here first of all this is a reasonable display this is a 4-in screen and it's a Samsung made AMOLED display so that's a huge deal back in these days you could see a meaningful difference in battery life just if you set a wallpaper with a bunch
of black in it because the pixels didn't have to light up on the OLED and that was A New Concept back then it's also only a 1500 Milah battery so every bit of savings you can get means a lot also of course this was back in the day when you could just pop the back off any phone and just take the battery out swap it out at any moment have two batteries if you want to swap them in and out real quick while the others are charging we will witness the death of this feature during this video but then using this
phone now like okay it feels slow obviously but it's not really in the laggy or unresponsive way it's just slow like there's a lot of solid waiting for anything to happen especially heavier stuff like the web browser or opening the camera you just have to slow down a little bit give it a second even though this launched with what at the time was the fastest Graphics processing of any smartphone thanks to a Samsung made chip inside oh and speaking of cameras it launched with a single 5 megapixel
camera on the back which was capable of shooting actually 720p video right out the box it asks for a memory card to do a lot of things like shooting videos because it only comes with two or 4 gigs of storage out the box but there's a Micro SD card expandable storage slot in the back of the phone so you could go right up to 32 gigs right off the bat so I never used one of these phones but my favorite thing about it now is it it's kind of got the modern shape already it has like kind of flat sides and a flat
back there is no camera bump uh there is a small bump in the plastic actually over the rear-facing speaker because it was common to put your phone down on a table or something and without that bump it would block the speaker and so that bump literally is just to keep the speaker open so you can always hear your sound now you remember how I was saying Samsung will kind of just try anything that's been true since the first one like this first ever Galaxy S launched with like I said over a dozen variants
and so you might recognize this one as the Samsung Galaxy S Stratosphere and you can tell because this is the one with a little Verizon stamp on its forehead here but you might have had the Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant that's what it would be called if you got the variant that was made for T-Mobile or the Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G which which is what they call the one that launched on Sprint now in hindsight honestly it feels like this was Samsung's way of just getting around carrier exclusives
cuz they basically just made a slightly different version of this phone for every carrier in America with a little bit of a different design and a little bit of different features only Samsung only Samsung little did they know this would be the beginning of a whole empire so the sequel the first sequel is a Samsung Galaxy S2 second gen can teach you a lot so right away a couple things this phone is not bigger and noticeably sleeker than the first Galaxy S and these were back in the days where the
percentage increases year-over-year with some of the stuff they did was crazy on paper like this went from a 1 GHz chip to a 1.2 GHz dual cord chip so that just more than doubled the processing power it also went from a 4in screen to a 4.3in screen it goes from a 5 megapixel 720p camera to an 8 megapixel camera on the back shooting 1080p it doubled the ram up to a gbyte it bumped up to a "1,650 mAh battery and the amount of Base" storage I guess you would say octed from
2 gigs all the way up to 16 and it did all that in a phone that got thinner and it also added NFC so it added pieces and now this is an 8 12 mm phone so this is one of the thinnest phones in the world at the time that it came out now the starting price also did go up a lot from $3.99 to $5.49 but this phone did launch into a relative success this sold like 3 million units in the first two months this was definitely the first one to show up on my radar I never owned one of these
phones but I definitely saw it and thought about it but then this next one the Galaxy S3 in 2012 this is the first Samsung Galaxy S that I actually owned and I remember loving this thing I remember it well too the jump up and size again was very real so it's all the way up to a 4.8 in phone now which believe it or not like this is starting to push the limits of what people considered an appropriate phone size cuz I remember around this time there were a lot of phones that were hitting exactly
4.65 in like that was a popular phone screen size for the big phones at the time and anything near 5 in kind of felt like weird like a tablet size and here's Samsung's flagship pushing 4.8 in of screen and then the four capacitive buttons down at the front are now just three buttons the search button's gone so it's a home button that's a physical button with back button on the right and menu on the left and this is also the first time we got a voice assistant on the phone and they called it SVO
clever I know this is a a pretty direct response to we just got Siri announced on the iPhone the year before but you know S Voice s for Samsung they also use S for a bunch of other stuff S Notes so Samsung voice S Voice Now S Voice wasn't good but then again neither were any of the other voice assistants that were coming out so this is mostly just people poking around asking it to do things random facts just weather things like that what turned out to be much more significant with this phone is just this
super Sleek design design the whole thing is shaped like a thin Pebble that you could probably skip across a lake it's inspired by Nature the whole OS leaned into that it had a ton of water droplet sounds everywhere the lock screen went from swipe to unlock to dragging your finger through this water like it was a pretty strong theme for them but I remember using this phone and reviewing it this is back in college for me I loved it it was also received very well and the combo of like being super
slim and fast and having a huge OLED and S Voice had it starting to get touted like the iPhone killer um but I think more interestingly they thought this phone was big enough to Warrant an S3 Mini cuz this is a 4.8 in screen like I said kind of giant and so they came out with the one with a 4-in display Galaxy S3 Mini at the same time cuz of course they did but the next year we got Samsung Galaxy S4 which was the beginning of a lot of things what do I feel like the fourth generation of any
major new product is like the defining one this is this one's no exception now of course they're still making gigantic leaps on paper with specs cuz these little pocket computers are getting more and more capable of everything they do so goes from a 4.8 in 720p screen to being one of the first phones with a 5 in 1080P screen in the age of a bunch of new retina displays that are aiming for the best pixel density then they also had variance all the way up from 1.4 to 1.9 GHz dual core processors it again
doubled the Ram from 1 to 2 gb and that single back camera went from 8 megapixels to 13 megapixels so this is the first time you could take 1080p videos from the camera on the Galaxy S and then watch them on the 1080p screen on the front of the Galaxy S pretty sick "this also goes from a 2,000 millah" battery to a 2600 Mah hour battery still removable uh a 30% increase is pretty crazy but again they just keep aiming for one day of battery life that's been a theme since this long AG go like yes
these things get more and more powerful every year and they're doing more and more stuff but as long as they can hit one day of battery life they seem cool with that now if you want more proof of Samsung just trying a ton of things this phone had a ton of random features some of them actually are kind of interesting cuz they feel like the the AI features of back in this day so like this is the phone that tried head tracking smart scrolling so when you're reading something you can tilt your head forward
and backward to scroll through the page it's just insane it had smart rotation so this is actually cool if you have auto rotate on but you're looking at the screen while reading something and then turn sideways it won't rotate the screen it'll keep it right side up Smart Pause is fun you're watching a video you look away from the screen it'll automatically pause you look back it'll play again so there's lots of stuff like this some of it sticks some of it doesn't fine but
this was also partially used to justify another increase in price for this phone so S4 at launch I don't know if you remember this it launched at 6 $150 this is also the first time Samsung made an active version of the phone so another variant so Galaxy S4 Galaxy S4 Active so this added IP67 certification and a more rugged design it was a TFT LCD display instead of AMOLED and it traded some other small downgrades for like physical buttons and a slightly thicker phone with some flaps to cover
the ports I'll tell you what was not really a major hit though this was one of the first major incidents of a Samsung phone battery swelling Catching Fire and burning up on someone now it didn't go happen to a ton of people it wasn't enough to become a major Trend but it's something to sort of remember for the future foreshadowing now by the time we get to Galaxy S5 Samsung is starting to hit their stride I think with the Galaxy S another huge battery bump now it's up to 2800 milliamps and
another huge screen bump all the way up to 5.1 in diagonally and across the board this is uh I think fully Flagship in every dimension it's a it's a 2.7 GHz processor on some variants all right 2 to 3 gigs of RAM up to 32 gigs of storage and it's a 16 megapixel camera that now shoots 4K video also the bottom left button has gone from a menu button to a multitasking button to match the three primary buttons needed to operate Android but also says a lot about what it's capable of but then of course
alongside all that is the absolute classic Samsung just trying things and I think the Telltale sign for this stuff like is when you see them try it for one generation just to throw it at the wall and see what sticks and then it's gone the next year like they added this little sensor back here next to the camera flash on the back that's a heart rate sensor so you could measure your heart rate plugs into S Health that didn't last very long they also added this weird texture for the first time to
this plastic back that you know made it a little softer yes but also totally made it look like a Band-Aid plus it even came in this flesh color that also didn't stick around long they also added a fingerprint reader to the home button fun fact back in these days you actually had to swipe your whole finger across the home button to get it read of course fingerprint readers have stuck around but it doesn't have to be swiped anymore so that's improved significantly and you can see this weird port at the bottom
here the Galaxy S5 has a sort of a double Port basically it could be used as just normal micro USB for charging but if you wanted full USB 3.0 data speeds there was a special like double-ended cable you could plug in to use all the pins and get that kind of weird that didn't stick around long either also there was a a flap on the bottom of all these phones for water resistance and they were super easy to fall off and this one also fell off naturally they also released both an
active and a separate sport version of this phone alongside the regular Galaxy S5 of course they did so Samsung Galaxy S6 came out in 2015 but truthfully this was the beginning of a new era for Samsung phones you can look at it and see it this is one they entered the modern age for better for worse so this phone was the first one with a fully glass back instead of plastic which yes made it their first non- removable back cue all the outrage in the comments of every YouTube video at the time but it
also added uh wireless charging and they dropped these metal rails and metal buttons on the sides that felt way more solid than all the plastic we were working with on all the flagships that came before it and this phone is Sleek like footprint wise it's literally the same size as an iPhone 15 Pro from today but turn it sideways and it's one of the slimmest phones ever thanks to having a 2550 mAh battery yes that's actually smaller than the previous year now this is a recipe to make enthusiasts
particularly mad when you go backwards it's not great so they heard that this went from a 2800 to a 2500 milliamp battery and it's not removable anymore and it also no longer has the micro SD card for expansion of your storage and on top of that you also went from that weird USB 3.0 thing down technically to USB 2.0 but aside from that this still did feel like their first really modern piece of Hardware this is also the first time we're getting a 1440p AMOLED display it's crazy sharp
already we haven't seen a higher resolution since then and it's also the first Galaxy S Flagship with Optical image stabilization in the primary camera so this is a really big camera upgrade and it was the first Galaxy S Flagship to use 64-bit processing I do remember there's a lot of positive reception around this phone obviously viously from being well put together in metal and glass now and having good features and just generally being the same price as the previous year I just
feel like there was one thing holding it back especially Among Us critical reviewers from being the obvious best Android phone available at that time and her name was TouchWiz see around this time there were also some other big Enthusiast Android options like Nexus 6p and 5x which were stock Android and then there was HTC1 M9 just down the street with their own HTC software LG G4 was out with their own software and like every Android device seen at this time when it comes out it's like what are the
specs what are the features what's the design and then what is the Android skin that you have to deal with to get it now Touchwiz has gotten better over time it's you know a little less bloop nature sounds but it's still absolutely a skin on top of Android rather than super integrated into Android itself which can make performance feel a little slow it can slow down how quickly updates come to this phone over time cuz they've got to go through Samsung but it gives you a
bunch of extra features in return So at the time if you go back if you watch my videos around the phones at this time I always preferred like stock Android OEM just straight from Google it's always the fastest updates and it just felt the cleanest and most coherent where Samsung TouchWiz just had this this colorful cartoony look to it this feel to it it was a little cluttered but it it it had the features it had What mattered anyway with S6 they also tried a little thing
called the S6 Edge and Edge Plus because there was this war being fought at the time every time you saw a keynote with a new smartphone announcement they always mentioned screen to body ratios and so every Flagship if they can improve the best number they would always brag about the screen to body ratio how thin their bezels are and the best phones at the time were hovering around 70% meaning 70% of the front of the device is screen and the bigger that number the cooler the phone looks so this S6 Edge thing
came along and it's another bit of Samsung Innovation just trying some stuff but they literally bend the OLED display right over to the edges of the phone and use curved glass to make it look like the display is like bleeding right over the edges of the device hence the edge name obviously there's still a bezel but it kind of worked it looked really cool uh this actually came at first from when they originally tried it in the Galaxy Note which they had it on one side of the screen which is some
like software tickers they literally put like a stock ticker on the side of the phone they would try anything to see if it worked and when it did they put it on both halves and now it's on the Galaxy S and it felt like the flagship thing so this phone got up to a 76% screen to body ratio with the S6 Edge Plus this is starting to feel like the top of a flagship lineup now Galaxy S7 was a kind of an incremental year in between you know holding it now you can tell they didn't really feel the need to change
too much like it's the same size same screens and resolutions same storage sizes up to 128 gigs and they actually brought back expandable storage by popular demand so I guess you can talk Samsung into some stuff and you still can't take the back off this thing but they went ahead and added a Micro SD card slot on the SIM card tray which is clever but what I feel like they really realized this year is two things one wow you can really shove a lot of batteries in these things and two The Edge is the
flagship people love the edge people just love the screen melting over the sides things so they're going to do a lot more of it so the regular S7 was "great but the S7 Edge had a 3,000 Mah" hour battery and the S7 Edge Plus had a 3600 mlia battery and then the S7 active "had a 4,000 mAh battery but for" reference this is also the same year that the Galaxy Note 7 came out so you may recall the issues that plague the phone and its 3500 mAh battery the exact issue the reason why the note 7s started
blowing up and having dangerous battery problems was specifically a design issue using a thin separator between two electrodes in a battery it was just damaged way too easily where wild reactions would occur when that damage happened for as many gates as we've had for smartphones like Ben gate whatever this has to be the greatest PR disaster in the history of smartphones like I think by a long way like people this got banned on planes like people would just ask do you have a Samsung phone like I
don't think you want to take that on the plane it was literally recalled worldwide they took all of them back they couldn't sell it anymore it's a big issue and honestly a lot of tech companies would never recover from that but Samsung at this point was established enough they were big enough they were trying enough new things that they could weather that storm which is impressive then Samsung Galaxy S8 this is one of my favorite phones they added a lot of things to this phone now still
classic Samsung thrown an absolute metric ton of stuff at the wall to see what sticks now I definitely didn't love all of the stuff that they tried but I love that they were trying stuff and they tried so many things that these phones just feel a world apart so first of all there was an S8 and an S8 plus and both have fully curved Edge displays so Samsung's realized that this Advantage is received really really well and they can just keep touting their massive screen to body ratios plus
they've refined their Edge screen apps feature it's subtle it's out of the way but it's useful for those who want to take advantage of it then they also tried this new pressure sensitive layer underneath the display right around the home button so the display can always respond to pressures in this area no matter where you are even while the screen is off now this is also as you may have guessed right around the time that Apple was trying 3D touch or Force touch in the iPhone and both of these
didn't last very long but they tried and they also tried a slightly taller narrower 18 and half by9 aspect ratio which actually did nicely keep the ever growing screen size to be pretty reachable uh since they've also gone from capacitive buttons below the screen to all onscreen buttons so now talk about screen to body ratio like we are really cooking they also switched to USBC for the first time sick easy win people were asking for that last year anyway but then with that they also
tried this thing called Dex which is like if you plug that USBC Port into a computer monitor you get this whole computer UI which just uses the phone as like a trackpad and then you might have noticed the extra button here on the left- hand side so fun fact for the entire history of every single Samsung Galaxy S so far they have always had power button on the rightand side volume rocker on the left hand side and that's still true here but they've added a button underneath the volume
rocker and yeah that's that's the Bixby button so Bixby is the new voice assistant replacing SVO on Samsung phones and Samsung really leaned in hard with this one so not only did it get a dedicated button to activate it all the time but the camera also now has Bixby Vision which is kind of like a an awkwardly specific competitor to Google lens and this is Samsung really leaning into the whole AI assistant thing for the first time and I would say to mixed success then they also tried a
fingerprint reader on the back of the phone this time since there's no home button anymore love that and then they also tried this this plastic Snap-on keyboard which I think honestly might be in my top five worst smartphone accessories of all time but even after all of that I think the most important or the most impactful decision for this phone for Galaxy S8 was their choice to use Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in some regions and Samsung's own made exos chips in other regions now at the time
or even in hindsight this was a pretty smart move maybe even ahead of their time because this is Samsung going all right we want to make our own chips for our phones so that we can maximize the efficiencies and all the the power and the things that we do in our phones we want them to all be built by us and also to not give Qualcomm so much money while we're at it but also in hindsight this failed spectacularly this was like an ongoing thing they really wanted to do but because they didn't go all exos
right from the get-go they split it they had some exos and some Snapdragon the Snapdragon phones would consistently and regularly outperform the exos version of the same phone across the board better performance better efficiency better battery better heat it literally got to the point where prospective buyers would jump into subreddits and forums to try to find where they could import a Qualcomm version of the phone instead of the xnos one available in their own country and there are a whole bunch of
tutorials on if you're buying a secondhand one how do you know which version you're getting just based on the serial number just so you can avoid the exos version like I said in sight ahead of their time a bit here but big backfire nevertheless there was lots of other stuff that was so new about this phone it Justified another increase in price all the way up to $750 that's today's prices so Galaxy S9 I'm going to say this was Peak Samsung Galaxy S I loved this galaxy S9 and
again it was Galaxy S9 and S9 plus now this was a relatively incremental update versus S8 but you know slightly thinner bezels same Ram same storage but a slightly improved processor nice colors I like these colors and then they also moved that fingerprint sensor on the back from right next to the camera to right under the camera otherwise you know what basically the same thing but then they had to try some stuff so this time they tried this dual aperture thing with the
camera and it was super cool basically it could snap between f1.5 wide open and f2.4 a variable aperture in a smartphone it's it's a clever little thing that would let you receive as much light as possible in low light situations but when you have plenty of light it would stop down to 2.4 and it would get more in focus it would be a sharper better looking photo and I remember I loved it when I used it other reviewers loved it when they used it and then it was gone from the next phone Samsung we missed
this bring it back but honestly this is one of those phones picking it up now like I've talked about this before if you could bring back any old phone design from whatever year and just modernize it with new specs and new software I think between HTC1 M8 or M9 and this phone pretty good candidates this this thing is Sleek it's just a great size it's a 1440p OLED USB type-c still has a headphone jack obviously the fingerprint reader is in a good spot just a really great overall package and
I said as much in my original review back in 2018 now is it still Samsung software yeah but at this point there are so many features jammed in here that it's kind of undeniable the utility and yeah people are totally willing to live with it as long as you know what you're getting into with a Samsung phone fun fact this is also the year that Samsung unveiled the Galaxy home a small Weber grill shaped speaker designed to be an AI assistant in your house with Bixby "it's been about 2,000 days since that"
announcement no word on it since then I don't think it's officially been cancelled maybe they just want us to forget about that one so then Samsung graduates to the Galaxy S10 this I think could be argued also maybe as Peak Samsung since they've now basically just gone full screen to the point where reviews are complaining about the last few millimeters of forehead and Chin like you see how the chin is just a tiny bit bigger but yeah up at the top we've gone right up to the earpiece and the
selfie camera is now a cutout in the top right hand corner giving birth to a whole new genre of meme wallpapers screen to body ratio is approaching 90% now now and we're basically just looking at Samsung's best-in-class 1440p AMOLED and not much else and now these phones have gotten irreversibly big S10 has a 6.1 in display and the S10 plus would be 6.4 borderline tablet sized 10 years removed from the original but truly entering us into the Modern Age this is the first Samsung phone with more than
one camera on the back and in Samsung fashion they just jump straight to three obviously so there's a primary camera a 2X telephoto camera and a0 5x Ultra wide phones would never look the same after this point every phone up until now so far has had just that tiny little camera bump just a single little circle or oval on the back but as soon as you open this box you're never going back cameras are now a feature on the back of a phone and you'll also notice there is no fingerprint reader on the back of this
phone because this is also the first one that they tried that ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath the display glass and it's they pretty much nailed it right from the GetGo I remember testing it and seeing if it will work underwater and if it was scratched at all it was fine it haven't really improved in much since these days so it seems like they nailed it they still use it but the thing that maybe brought this phone the most into the age of modern smartphones might just be the
price so Samsung's been throwing a ton of stuff at the wall for years and now they've just built out this whole lineup but S10 starts at $900 when it comes out and then they have the S10 plus which starts at at "1,000 they also had an S10 5G which was" an even bigger even more expensive version of the phone with a bigger battery to support you know 5G radios because 5G is sort of burgeoning at this time expensive phones I think that actually is why one of my favorite new releases around this time was this
little new thing they made called the s10e and this thing you know it's not quite a mini but this is where Samsung made a couple little corner cutting decisions to separate the true Flagship from something a little more budget friendly so for $750 it has slightly smaller and slower charging battery and a power button fingerprint reader instead of the ultrasonic unders screen one but honestly probably a better deal than the flagships that it was up against so now on to the next one Galaxy
s20 and no we didn't skip any phones here basically 2020 is the year Samsung decided that they were going to sync up the year of the calendar with the year of the phone so we have s20 in 2020 I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that the number was always slightly behind the flagship iPhone but now this  looks blank boring soulless what happened like this feels like this is a complete blank phone like if you put the S10 next to the s20 and then not to jump too far
forward but the S21 it looks like they took a year off with the s20 like this might be the most generic phone of all time now to be fair there are other phones that have looked like this and again this is Samsung's flagship for years and we know they're going to I start to play it safe but in hindsight this one is pretty dull it also happens to be the first ever Galaxy S since the very beginning to move the volume rocker to the right side that's a choice it also is the first one to not say the
model number on the back at all with the text it's just blank and it's also the first Galaxy S to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone after making fun of them and removing the headphone jack also a choice now I do love that this was officially the first Galaxy S Flagship with 120 HZ display and they actually moved the smaller hole punch camera to the top middle and was the first to be able to record 8K video so it's still gaining capabilities it's not like the ball didn't move forward at all
with this phone but probably the more interesting Dynamic is what was happening at the very top of the lineup see this is the first year of the Ultra phone so s20 still a regular siiz phone th000 phone but they also decided to make a gigantic phone with the most possible numbers and the highest 10 possible specs and make it an Ultra and this was kind of fighting at the top of the lineup with the Galaxy Note because up until this point you know they tried a whole bunch of stuff and they ended up
having this particularly successful high-end phone with a stylus in it that was if you wanted even more than the S could offer you could go buy a Galaxy Note so this phone in this year kind of just like its design just kind of got forgotten until later in the year when they dropped The Fan Edition the Fe of the exact same phone cut a couple things down 10 80P removed like one or two features 700 bucks and this phone was a great deal this one my phone of the year but also fun not so fun fact uh this
galaxy s20 has also started swelling like the battery has started to bulge to the point where it's pushing the back of the phone off of the chassis through the glue so I'll just say I've had a lot of smartphones come through the studio we review a lot of phones obviously and we've had basically a large sample size of smartphones in long-term storage and the only brand that's had more than one smartphone whose battery swells up like a balloon to the point where we have to get rid of
it is Samsung but then the year was 2021 and Samsung drops Galaxy S21 definitely bringing us up to the current design language that is so recognizable as a Samsung phone so this triple camera is now on the corner of the back it's unist able now in fact this might be their best one with the metal piece melting over the sides and specifically this purple and gold color way I think it's kind of iconic this is also the beginning of the base models being extremely boring I'm calling it now like
the the the action's way higher and lower in the lineup like the note fighting the ultra for Supremacy that's crazy also The Fan Edition and the a series kind of fighting each other to be the best overall value but sitting in the middle kind of no man's land that just can't mess anything up and has to play it safe well that's exactly what the S21 did they actually bumped down to a 1080p display they're back to Flat displays now no more expandable storage in this model no more charger in the Box
for this model whatever the industry is doing that's what they're doing like there's no leadership here there's just just enough brand cache that like if they make a Samsung version of the phone that everyone's buying in stores and put it next to that in the store people will just buy the Samsung one so Galaxy s22 is more along the same track slightly more boring colors slightly flatter edges all the way around but on the upside this thing also does basically have perfectly thin bezels all
the way around at this point so I think the screen toider ratio now is well into the '90s and frankly I don't even care what the number is anymore I just feel like there's so little bezel to hold with my fingers that anything less wouldn't really make any sense so the bezel is effectively gone at this point it makes perfect sense to go back to the perfectly flat displays because Samsung has now realized and everyone else has realized that those curved displays they're kind of cool and they look cool
in the past but they were kind of a crutch to make the phone appear to have a larger screen to body ratio than it actually did but now that we have the tech to go right up to the edges and the corners you don't have to curve the display anymore it just looks sick and is flatter and is more durable so actually maybe the most notable change on the outside here is these phones are now slightly smaller than the previous year so it went from 6 .2 and 6.7 in to 6.1 and 6.6 in for s22 and s22 plus and
there is no doubt in my mind that that is specifically to give more room and a bigger Gap to the Ultra phone at the top of the lineup the ultra has been doing battle with the note it's winning it stole the Spen from it and so with these boring default base phones for 750 bucks flat totally fine just just look up there though there's some more expensive phones you can spend more money so the Galaxy S 23 was interesting for one reason and one reason only no more exos version so every single Galaxy s23 and
Galaxy s23 plus and s23 Ultra ships with the same slightly customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy and yeah performance is great you know for all the years that they've been trying to catch up the xnos chip to the Snapdragon chip they finally gave up on it which you could argue is good news because everyone now gets the good Snapdragon performance and efficiency now but it's also kind of bad news because there's less competition there's that much less incentive for Qualcomm to do anything
particularly great here the whole goal for exos chips was supposed to be better customization and integration and while we got rid of that they can still claim with s23 to have done at least some customization because they've like I said they've made it a four Galaxy chip so it's not quite the off-the-shelf one everyone else gets what's different slightly higher clock speeds slightly more powerful because they've got better Cooling in these phones so mission accomplished aside from that
they've removed even more character by getting rid of the signature camera bump and making an even more generic and Universal appeal phone than ever before just same set of cameras same aspect ratio same features just slightly more battery in both versions nobody's saying these phones are bad they're just not making exciting strides the way they used to back in the day which brings us to this year's Samsung Galaxy s24 even more boring colors and even more generic design and even more
playing it safe than ever before this year it's the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and this chip enables some pretty substantial AI features which they lean into it makes the phones really good stuff like live translation and generative photo editing call screening and my personal favorite Circle to search is awesome but a lot of the AI features are now making their way to some other phones and circle to search isn't an exclusive the pixel has that too and frankly aside from just getting
flatter edges and slightly bigger batteries they share a lot of parts with the previous year's phones like the cameras uh the screen resolutions they bumped up a little bit but functionally the same screen to body ratios the same maybe the buttons are clicker maybe that's enough these phones are all grown up now so now we've seen the glow up the different eras the plastic to the glass the iconic to the static but my favorite way to visualize all these different types of improvements is the graphs so
welcome to my favorite section the graph section now before we jump fully in a quick word from our Channel sponsor dbrand fun fact they've been supporting these devices since the Galaxy S4 that is a long time now they're also supporting all the way up to Galaxy s24 and I think this year with these phones a lot of us were expecting to get ch2 support to get kind of like that ring of Mag safe style magnets but for whatever reason the Stars didn't align so this phone doesn't have that but with dbrands
cases for the s24 series they all come with magnets built in so that means basically any ch2 or mag safe accessories will work on the s24 so they essentially give you that easy alignment on any wireless charger pretty sick uh you can check it out at the link below in the description so let's take a look at how far these phones have come these are really interesting and there's a couple of them I think Samsung is the first one that has has notable ups and downs in their progress graphs which is
really interesting it kind of feels like they're going backwards but there's reasons behind all of it also this could be a way crazier graph because they obviously split out and Fork into a bunch of different models The Edge models the plus models the ultra models the active models but I'm just sticking with just the base models just for pure Simplicity of visuals so first up screen sizes so these are the screen sizes of the base Samsung Galaxy S over every single year starting at the original 4in
Samsung Galaxy S then really quickly jumping up into the fives and then kind of slowing down and settling in right around 6 in you can actually see a slight dip where the S10 was 6.1 in then it was 6.2 again then back to 6.1 to make room for the ultra then back up to 6.2 again feels like now there's a sort of a dedicated gigantic phone so this rate of growth has pretty much evened out so the huge phone is the ultra which is 6.8 in which is crazy but here's a fun fact based on this chart maybe it's
not a fact but you can make an argument that the Galaxy s20 was kind of peak Samsung cuz that is the same screen size as today's Base phone but hold that thought let's look now at battery sizes so you know battery life hasn't really improved dramatically we're still at a day for a good phone but the physical capacity of these batteries they able to fit in these phones has improved significantly as well so you can see it "starts at, 1500 Milah hours removable of" course and nearly d
by the Galaxy S5 but then it dips right when they introduce the edge phones then they shoot back up again but again kind of flatlines in line with a certain memorable battery related event but then they eventually got the courage to walk back up the base phone all the way to "4,000 milliamp and what do you know" again you can argue Galaxy s20 is Peak Samsung that's the first year of the "4,000 mAh battery and that is still the" battery size again now the primary camera megapixel count this one's a
little more interesting maybe a little more classic improvement over time of course megapixels don't mean everything but it's fun to see the priorities increase over time at the beginning there was a lot of incentive to just level up from 720p to 1080p video and then to 4K video but once we hit 8K you know there's not any reason to go too crazy with megapixels beyond that of course the highest end Ultra phones quickly blasted the ceiling way up all the way to 100 megapixels and then 200
this year which is nuts but for the Baseline phone you know most people's screens aren't 50 megapixels so I think this is a very appropriate Plateau but then last but not least starting price we all know what happened with smartphones over the years and here you can see it visualized the steep climb through 400 500 600 bucks right up to the $900 ceiling for the base Galaxy S this is the base phone now the most expensive phone has of course gotten dramatically more expensive too so again that ceiling
lifting with the ultra has allowed "Samsung to go way up to $1,300 starting" "and today you can pay $1,660 for the 1" TB Galaxy s24 Ultra but that has at least helped bump the base price back down a little bit to the $7.99 of today so that's how we got from here to here from Galaxy S1 to s24 these videos are super fun to sort of look back and actually visualize that progress over time I also feel like I already know which one we want to do next get subscribed make sure you see
that coming up either way thanks for  peace from two gigs all I deserve that
