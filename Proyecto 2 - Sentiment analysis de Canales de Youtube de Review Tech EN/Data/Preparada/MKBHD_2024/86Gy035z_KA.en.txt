I actually love this thing I love this thing not because it's Flawless or anything it is far from Flawless but because it's actually interesting like don't forget the last two three years of Apple product review comments are just um that's boring oh it's just a spec bump there's nothing really new here oh they hardly change anything or try anything new these days but this this thing is interesting it's risky and most of all it's new now it's actually not fundamentally new it's a VR headset but
it's new for apple and there are a bunch of things in here that are new in a way that only Apple would try and just as interesting as this individual product is the possible future that this implies like when you get a first generation product like this you sort of automatically assume that there are goals for its future that it'll have another generation and another one after that and that there is some goal for what this will turn into 10 years down the road because we saw what happened
with the iPhone and the mac and the iPad and all sorts of other first generation products and on top of all of that as far as I know Apple has never released any other first generation product with the word Pro already in the name which comes with a whole another set of implications so is the world ready for all of  it  so I might be one of the 20 people outside of Apple who has been using the Vision Pro the most over the past two weeks like I've spent hours in this thing with both bands with multiple Macs
in different setups different rooms indoors and Outdoors lightness and darkness there are parts of this thing that are absolutely amazing unparalleled best I've ever seen but the reason it's so interesting is because it's actually new and there are downfalls and flaws and tradeoffs that come alongside all of this stuff so at the end of the last video I gave you guys a sort of a preview of my pros and cons list if you haven't already watched that video it is definitely worth watching almost like a
prequel to this one it is a 30 minute monster all about how to use this thing how it works what's inside what it's capable of and then at the end I got to my upsides which are immersiveness placement and space eye tracking and hand control pass through ecosystem and spatial audio and the downsides which are weight and comfort the eyes on the outside app selection right now battery life and price so okay for starters I want to amend immersiveness to Fidelity I think that's more accurate here I have
used a bunch of different VR headsets now and this Vision Pro has has the sharpest best looking micro OLED display out of all of them the size of individual pixels on these displays is 7 1 12 microns which means you could fit 64 of them in the size of a single iPhone screens pixel you can't see individual pixels there's no screen door effect it's awesome the native refresh rate is 90 HZ and it will crank up to 96 HZ when there's 24 FPS content playing to be an even multiple and apple says
that they calibrate every single one of these Vision Pro displays from the factory for maximum color accuracy they're really good and this is a big reason why this headset is so expensive but then and this is going to be a recurring theme Here The Vision Pro runs up against the technology of today not being quite Advanced enough to accomplish what they were probably hoping as ideal so in the case of these screens right they're amazing there are so many pixels but because there's so
many pixels the computer inside cannot actually render everything in high resolution all the time at 90 HZ so instead it does something clever it combines the insanely fast eye tracking with what's called fiated rendering meaning it's only actually rendering in high resolution exactly what you're looking at when you're looking at it the rest is soft and fuzzy that actually works really well because that's exactly how our eyes work it's really clever like you don't think about it but the
thing that you're looking at at the moment is sharp but then the rest of your peripheral vision is is soft and fuzzy and that's fine so really now all the Computing work is being done to track your eyes as fast as possible so that there's no lag between when you look at something and when it becomes sharp fun fact you can actually see this in screen recordings from The Vision Pro you can see the piece of the screen that I'm looking at is sharp and then everything else around it even parts of
the same window are fuzzy on purpose but to my eye that looks totally natural because I'm focusing on one thing at a time I found that you can also screen record with developer mode in xcode and that will make the clips 4K and it'll render everything in HQ all at once but every time I did that it would be choppy and scrolling would be slow and jittery and I'm thinking that's just because the computers aren't really used to rendering everything in high quality all the time so it looks like a higher
quality recording but the second I did any scrolling it didn't look as good so I just didn't use those recordings as often so the screens are great the position tracking of objects in space are great the eye tracking is incredibly good the one ding against immersion on the Vision Pro though and not a lot of people are talking about this but it's the field of view see the first few times you use this headset you don't even really think about it that much you're so distracted by all the fun and
the newness and how cool it is that your eyes are controlling the thing but eventually you start to poke around the edges and it turns out you know how people are saying this kind of looks like ski goggles from the outside well it also kind of looks like ski goggles from the inside a little bit too again the middle is super sharp and Incredibly impressive iive but if I can do my best here through a YouTube video the edges of the headset are a little bit further in than the edges of your vision and so
there's a little bit of like a cone effect going on and there's some chromatic aberration around the outside so you kind of have this slight feeling of looking into a large tunnel at everything there are actually no field of view numbers published by Apple anywhere about Vision Pro as far as I can tell and I kind of think that's on purpose because I have noticed from using them both that the quest 3 has a better wider field of view just looking inside the headset so if I could change
one thing about the Vision Pro to make it more immersive it would be a wider  question Vision Pro has the best pass through of any headset I've ever used that much is super clear to me and weirdly enough this doesn't actually surprise me either maybe because this is one of the products that makes it so obvious that they're thinking a lot about the future like apple talks a lot about AR and how they want things to just be clear and just overlaying things onto your real world but with today's
technology again that's not quite possible yet so instead they have a VR headset but they are using the highest quality camera feeds possible and the highest quality displays on the inside possible to let you almost feel like you're looking through it at the real world so you put this headset on and the first thing you see is pass through I mean you might as well call it transparency mode and the sharpness and the colors and the very low lat are all so good that I really don't experience
any eye fatigue no matter how long I am in this pass through mode despite my eyes being inches from these screens I can interact with the real world around me pick things up and look at them I can walk around between rooms and not trip on things I tried having people throw things at me and I could just catch them I played table tennis successfully with the headset on which is crazy if you think about what's actually happening here the total latency Apple says is 12 milliseconds that's from the outside
light hitting the outside sensors to the inside image being updated and hitting your eyeballs that's incredibly fast that's and that includes the exposure time of the cameras that's the specially designed R1 chip at work but as Nei from The Verge has put it it's still cameras and screens like the technology of today isn't Magic so you still have to expose a camera sensor and set ISO and shutter speed Etc and you can kind of play around with this a bit just by looking around like at bright objects or high
dynamic range environments and you know what for the variety of situations I've thrown at this thing it's handled it very impressively the whole time mostly prioritizing smoothness and high shutter speeds at the expense of cranking up the iso and getting way more noise especially in Darker environments but you can still see stuff like the hand occlusion break sometimes or look really janky when you put your hand in front of something you can still see objects start to float a little bit more an X Y
and Z space swinger in much lower lighting as opposed to the usual perfect position again it's the best I've ever seen with today's Tech but it definitely  go so honestly the ecosystem is I would say the strongest argument for a regular person going out and buying today's version of The Vision Pro like I I every time a new big product comes out or whatever I get like texts from people oh hey Marquez you know I know you already made like a 30 minute video about it and like unboxed it and did all that but
like what do you what do you really think about the Vision Pro like is it is it good enough should I get one and truthfully probably not but I will say that there are a good amount of things that I do specifically look forward to using for it and uh most of those things are ecosystem related so obviously there's the built-in apps right iMessage works perfectly just like any iPhone or iPad on your account photos are all loaded up in here straight from your iPhone this is clearly the headset that is best for
iPhone users Apple ecosystem people but also little things too like continuity so I can copy some text on my Mac or my iPhone and then hit paste and it shows up in the Vision Pro but there's two really impressive ones to me uh for very different specific reasons FaceTime and Mac virtual display see FaceTime is the most only Apple could ship this thing I've seen in a long time from the personas scanned in from the cameras on the front of the headset to the positional tracking and responsiveness of the
spatial audio it's all so well thought out that you know once everyone on the call gets past the initial like ah what is this the shock the moment they first see the virtual version of you once they first get past that then it actually kind of slowly gets easier and it feels way more like a normal conversation than a normal FaceTime and it trades the downside of not being able to hold up objects to your camera for a button that can switch to a realtime firstperson view where you can use both hands
instead of one does the audio from these speakers still bleed out into the rest of the world so anything over half volume is incredibly audible to everyone in the room around you yeah but does it also still sound really really impressive for not actually being real headphones yeah but the other thing is Mac virtual display this is my number one favorite feature of the Vision Pro even over like watching movies and stuff now first of all yes you can already do remote desktop viewing on something like
a quest 3 it's great I love that too but this this one is way more interesting so this is connecting to your Mac and then intaking and rendering a new virtual display for your Mac not mirroring what's already being shown by your computer so you can use your Mac with all its existing controls you're already using with it but make your new monitor literally as big as you want and then you can open up simultaneous Vision Pro apps all around that Mac display and place them all around the room wherever
you want over the walls floating in midair pin them to other objects whatever you can go nuts now is this perfect no there are definitely trade-offs from even the little things like not being able to see your keyboard when you're in an immersive environment to only being able to have a single virtual Mac monitor at a time to always having to look where you're controlling I keep telling you guys there's definitely extra brain Cycles involved here but I do still think that despite
all that this is this is my number one favorite feature of this Vision Pro the number one thing that you can buy it for and do that you couldn't do with any other Apple product I mean it's the difference between looking like this in a coffee shop or looking like this in a coffee shop pick your poison I guess I also had a moment where I was using the VIS Pro for a while and I had my Mac and some other monitors around me and then I took it off and then I went and did something and then I came back and
before I put the headset back on I looked up at the wall to where I thought a window was going to be but I hadn't I hadn't I don't know if that says more  me but speaking of apps we got to get into the weaknesses and the app situation on Vision Pro right now is one of them so this is the home screen of the Vision Pro it has all of your apps you can't rearrange them it's always alphabetical and this is a developing situation that will record and improve over time but as of right now as I
record this on launch day there are literally 600 apps made for the Vision Pro and that sounds like a lot at first but then kind of not a lot there are also the millions of other apps that are made for the iPad that are compatible with the Vision Pro that will show up but there's 600 apps made specifically for the Vision Pro the few apps that are showing up here are pretty incredible and they all kind of find unique and creative ways to take advantage of the 3D space and I fully believe the rest of
the developers are also kind of still trying to figure out what to do with the 3D space in their own apps or even if it makes sense to do anything at all beyond the normal iPad app but at this point right now today I honestly believe that there are way more cool ideas about VR and AR experiences than there are actual apps now don't get me wrong there are some cool apps and like I said I've shown some in the past video there are some more in this video and there will be more of that pop up every day but
have you seen that video of gamifying vacuum cleaning so that you can actually cover your entire floor space like a game it's not a real app but if it was it would be pretty sick and I would totally use it or maybe you've seen that other video of watching an F1 race in Vision Pro it is so sick it's like there's a virtual track over overlaid into your space so you can keep track of everything happening at once plus the times and you know smaller video feeds of the battles around different points
of the track this looks genuinely better than the actual TV broadcast experience but it's also not a real app yet it's just a concept and I've seen all kinds of other stuff and I I want to watch an NBA game courts side in the Vision Pro too but that experience doesn't seem to exist yet either whatever it is about like apple jumping into this new space and all the implications of like oh okay the tech is going to start to get better now this sort of unlocked this new creative layer for people to dream of
new AR and VR experiences and it'll be up to developers to actually make that stuff happen over time with the constraints of today's technology but as of right now not a lot of apps also no YouTube app no Netflix app there's no Spotify app there's no Tik Tock app yet I hope that Apple can sort of patch up the relationship with these developers because getting those apps will make this a better product but as of right now that is definitely a weakness of  product all right I'm not the only one
who's been saying this but this is not the most comfortable headset and I figured out why so first of all everyone's mentioned the weight and it's true it does weigh like 25% more than a lot of other headsets like take the quest 3 for example probably the most popular one familiar to most people that's mostly plastic and it weighs 515 G so Vision Pro being made of metal and having all this glass weighing in at nearly 650 g it kind of seems like apple just didn't care about the weight but I
don't think that's the case matter of fact if you've seen the tear Downs or if you've seen what's inside this little computer here on your face this is built incredibly efficiently there's carbon fiber in here magnesium all sorts of other lightweight materials now there's still lots of obvious heft on it but 25% more weight shouldn't be the difference between comfortable and like I need to do neck exercises no the problem is this strap this is the solo knit strap this is the strap that's in all the
commercials that everybody sees this is what's on Apple's website it's in all the Apple Stores because it looks so cool and I think when Apple was probably first deciding okay we're going to get into this VR headset Market how do we differentiate ourselves we got to reinvent a few things like the input method and all this stuff I think they thought the strap had to be one of them and that's how we got this thing and I think Dave 2D was spoton in his recent video VR headsets just kind of all look
dumb and the straps on them are all so universally lame looking and this this strap is just so much cooler you put it on it's the quickest to adjust it messes up your hair the least it obviously has this little adjustment thing on the outside so you can scroll this wheel and satisfyingly like tighten the cables inside like this this must have taken a lot of R&amp;D to get this thing to look iconic and actually be functional this is sick but when you put it on you sort of tighten it up against the front of
your face and it's putting it's squeezing it up against your face all of the weight up at the front against basically these two pressure points right above your eyes and right on your cheeks and the more you tighten it to prevent light leak the more uncomfortable it gets and it's just it's so hard to wear this for more than about 30 45 minutes after 45 minutes I really do need to take this off so it's not your neck as much as it's just all the pressure on the front of your face and
apple knows this and that's why they've included in the Box this second band this is the Dual Loop band and it's super easy to pop this one off and pop this one on now it's not as cool looking as a solo knit band and it's going to mess up your hair more than the solo knit band and it's not as easy to adjust as a solo knit band you're literally like trying to find an attach velcro blindly at the top of your head basically it's almost as lame looking as every other VR headset strap but it
turns out they all look like this for a reason and oh my God is it's so much better for wearing it for a long time I just recently did the last episode of the waveform podcast you can go subscribe over there I wore the headset for the entire thing a 2hour recording and I could never have done that with the solo knit band and that's because it's taking a ton of the pressure off of the front of your face and taking the weight and using the top of your head to support it instead it's so much better
so if you're going to just hand the headset to someone to use it for like 5 minutes this solo knit band is great because it's super quick doesn't mess up their hair easy to adjust boom but if you plan on using this thing for an extensive period of time yeah the the  so I don't know if the eyes on the outside of this headset are actually accomplishing what Apple probably wanted them to accomplish I think this again comes down to what we expect Vision Pro to be in the future see-through glasses
way down the line but that's obviously not possible with today's Tech so the closest we can get is a lenticular display that shows your eyes to the outside world and so that you can see them and they can kind of see you I don't know at this point I've tried my eyes but also everyone else here at the studio has also scanned themselves in and tried it eyesight and it's just not very visible like the smooth glass of the headset is so incredibly reflective that there's almost always some light
bouncing off it in a way that makes the eyes hard to see and even if you can see it it's pretty low resolution thanks to the lenticular display and the bottom line is it doesn't actually feel like eye contact most of the time which is very different from what you might have seen in the ads especially for darker skin tones and I was actually thinking about this like this is so far from what I think I expected that I was wondering does Apple in the Next Generation Vision Pro double down on eyesight or do they
get rid of it and I think they have to keep it like it's such an iconic part of the headset that everyone's expecting it to stay so it's got to be there but also this is Vision Pro and it I think that implies that we're going to get apple Vision at some point down the road which is like a less expensive version of this and with that do you take out eyesight or does that still appear in the lower-end  tell so all right look at the end of the day when I'm answering those texts about
what do people want to know what I really think about Vision Pro I think the Vision Pro is a really expensive really fun toy like this is an incredibly fun piece of tech to play with and I am loving watching the pieces of media built specifically for Vision Pro I am loving playing some of the new early games that are taking advantage of the 3D space and the hand controls I am loving the idea of getting on a plane and editing videos on my Mac or watching a movie on a gigantic screen while the
person next to me can't see any of what I'm doing that stuff is all so sick and if you're actually thinking about buying one I think you should be able to expect to enjoy all of that same stuff too but definitely still note that all of the symptoms of a first generation product are definitely also still here it's heavy it's not a lot of apps the battery life is meh and it's expensive so here's the bigger question is the Vision Pro a guaranteed success in the future because
the first generation iPhone had all of the same downfalls in its generation and look at where we are now so also same with the watch same with the iPad but here's the thing you can't just say the other stuff had problems and it became successful therefore this one having problems also means it's successful it doesn't work that way there has to be something about this that people actually like that makes them willing to overlook the first generation downfalls and I think this has it I I think it has
I honestly it's kind of just the Sci-Fi fun nature of like controlling things with your hands moving Windows around the room the sci-fi movie energy you've seen you're probably already thinking of a certain movie that has that sort of energy this has that and the fact that these ideas of what people want to do in VR are so universally well-liked and so cool that means that there's something here there's something that people want even in this first generation now will
all this new attention on VR headsets in general shine a lot of light on all of the other much cheaper competitors that you should probably buy instead of this one like the $500 Quest 3 yeah now will all this new developer attention in this VR AR space bring a lot of way cooler way more awesome applications that will rapidly improve "the value proposition of this $3,500" first gen headset yeah should you go out and buy one of these if you've got the money and you saw one or two really cool looking apps
that you want to try from the videos sure why not it's your money but I'm already very excited for the Next Generation thanks for  peace
