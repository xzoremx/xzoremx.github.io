okay I got to see something really really cool I got to visit some of the secret Labs inside of the Walt Disney company called the Disney imagineering Labs so you know I've seen some people talk about them a little bit before but obviously Disney has all these attractions and theme parks and rides and somebody has to design and engineer all that stuff and there's a surprising amount of tech that goes into it and some of it is still experimental and unreleased where no one outside of
Disney well except for me now has gotten to use them this thing is so cool so Disney imagineering has a bunch of these buildings scattered around this California neighborhood that I got to visit where they make realistic animatronic robots as part of their attractions they literally greeted me at the door with these little droids the same ones that are roaming around the theme parks and these things have a striking amount of similarities to the Boston Dynamic spot robot that I got to
play with a few years ago you know that spot robot was able to navigate any terrain with an Adaptive gate and it followed instructions from a custom but surprisingly easy to learn controller so that it could navigate around and do jobs that humans won't and is also super fun to play with these little droids for the theme parks are a lot of the same stuff they are able to adapt to any terrain they walk around they follow instructions from a customized steam deck as the controller which took me
like 60 seconds to learn and they can navigate around relentlessly all day interact with guests at a theme park and being fun to play with it was super fun and it's also seriously crazy how much Tech is even inside one of these things it's literally it's blending all these animations together from the walking to the standing and looking around it's pretty cool but that's not even what I was there to try I was there specifically to be the first person outside of Disney to walk on the hollow
tile so you might have seen some videos about this the H tile it's this insane one of one 360Â° treadmill like a moving floor basically it's still in an experimental phase and this is the only one that exists but it's already got these gears turning in my head about future potential applications particularly in VR and actually one specific thing that I have reservations about but I'll get to that in a minute now I I don't know that anyone's actually fully explained exactly how
this thing works yet but you can see that they're basically walking across a huge number of these tiny 1-in discs that are spinning on top of their bases like a bunch of tiny treadmills and then turning to match the direction that you're walking so obviously a normal treadmill is One Direction right just one flat plane moving forward and spinning around so you always know exactly where you're going but let's say you want to build a treadmill that's responsive and can go in any direction
well a flat treadmill it would be really hard right it would have to spin around quickly to match whatever Direction you're walking which is just kind of insanee so instead built into the floor is a bunch of articulating cones with discs on top of them with motors inside to spin those discs okay and then the key here is the discs are tilted so only the edge of the disc in the air is the part that's actually touching what's on the floor so it's less of a flat treadmill and more of a bunch of small
blades that are rotating under your feet so when you walk forward they spin clockwise to move your foot back to the middle once it's landed and actually when you walk backwards they spin counterclockwise to move your foot back to the middle so no matter where you go whatever Direction You Walk no matter how long or how fast your stride is it'll always pull you right back to the middle so I've seen these videos that Disney's put out of this guy walking on it but we got to work our way up to that
you know I've never walked on it before and it's capable of some other things so let's let's graduate let's get there so there are three ways to control this thing there's walk on it obviously but there's also using a controller like a PlayStation 5 controller and there's also just straight up using the force and just pointing at it with your hands let's start there so first we put this Apple box on the hollow tile and there's a screen up here that shows in real time all of the inputs and what the
sensors are seeing both on the floor and around the floor and they've actually mapped anything that crosses a certain line in front of me to move whatever object is on the floor so when I move my hand in front of that line the program moves the floor around to match the movement of the object with the movement of my hand and this is pretty sick I assume everyone watching this has seen Star Wars and realizes how dope it would be to have something like this in some sort of Star Wars experience in a theme
park so this is already super cool but then the first time I actually get to get on the holot to myself is in a chair and with a PlayStation controller so I am going to be in a chair chair where the chair is on a piece of wood so it's just flat bottom and then they just handed me the PlayStation controller and  so the left joystick is mapped to control position and the right joystick controls rotation so you can spin around and move around freely and actually get pretty quickly used to this thing and if
you're wondering yes I can steer myself completely off of the floor it would let me I was just kind of trying to be careful to not fling myself off the edge  fast so now after all that now that I've experienced how it moves now they're going to let me walk on the hollow tile all right so I'm going to start with training mode which is a fraction of the normal speed but will still get me used  ready training mode is on so now slowly start to walk I can feel them kind of wiggling a little bit
but not really moving too quickly yet so this is normal oh okay now they're starting to move and my feet are starting to move with the tiles there we go so as I slowly walk a little bit faster a little bit more quickly a  strides I'm getting more used to the feeling of the the tiles so they designed this to be about a 2minute process as these tiny s slowly speed up their responsiveness to my movements and it was slowly turned up more and more basically until it was at 100% real time
it's moving pretty close to full speed now feels like and there's obviously a learning curve but I feel like I'm good enough at it that I can kind of walk around and not think too hard it's good and then there's all the data behind me in real time  legs so walking on this I noticed a couple things first of all as you've heard through this video it's pretty loud like this is going to be something they definitely are going to want to work on especially if it's something that'll be a part of a theme park
someday or maybe even in someone's home but also I found it fascinating you're never actually quite walking in a perfectly straight line like it can feel pretty close if your foot happens to line up along a row of discs that are all aligned in a way from the center but other times you're just kind of Gliding Over the Top of a bunch of these ridges and you're not moving in a perfectly straight line I imagine a future version of this looks like a whole bunch of much smaller and more numerous discs that are
just as powerful as they are which is clearly an engineering challenge or an imagineering challenge so yeah this takes some getting used to I know that because I got to hang out with the inventor of the hollow tile Lanny Smoot he's been at Disney for more than 20 years he's got more than 70 patents including the way the bb8 rolls around the park the real life lightsabers just to name a few he's kind of a legend and yeah this guy's incredible on it he was showing me you can have two people on it
at once they were playing a multiplayer racing game like controlling a bb-8 around a course by jogging around and it seemed to work pretty well aside from being pretty small obviously this would work better if they had more of these floor tiles but then what I found the most crazy is using this floor with a VR headset on so this is what you would expect it to be for for VR right and there's been some other 360 degree treadmill type of videos I've seen other types of inventions used for VR and they
work but the one thing that's hard about these and it's hard to explain through video but the difference between what your eyes see and what your body and brain feel that disagreement so meaning like this has always been true if you look down at your phone a lot in a moving car right your eyes are seeing something still they see your body sitting still but then your brain and your inner ear feels you moving around moving forward and so the disagreement between what your eyes see and what your
brain feel that's what can give you motion sickness that's what feels bad and so if you think about it it's the same thing with this moving treadmill in VR you put the headset on and you start walking and your eyes see that you are walking down a moving hallway you're moving forward but your brain because you're walking in place doesn't feel that it's supposed to be moving forward so again there's a disagreement there so with the hollow tile I got to try putting on an Apple Vision Pro and
actually walking around a 3D constructed environment you can't see it but I'm in like a hollow deck and Star Trek or something and I've got a harness on because it turns out this is really hard my eyes see the movement and my legs are trying to walk forward and my feet are sliding around but my brain thinks I'm not supposed to be moving forward so it's confusing it's hard to just trust it and walk plus there's the extra layer of sometimes it moves you backwards a little bit to the center so I was taking
all these baby steps meanwhile though watch Lanny do it and he's just incredible at it like he had the headset on he was walking around confidently through space exploring a virtual world pretty sure it's like a virtual Disney theme park type of thing but that's the type of thing that feels the most like the future just free form exploring some huge space walking around in the comforter of your own home maybe and that would be amazing and if this thing can continue to be developed maybe just
maybe it can get us closer to that reality someday either way that is definitely dope Tech I'm glad I got to see the first version of this and I'm very curious and excited to see future versions Disney please invite me back I want to see what the future of this actually looks like okay that's it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace p
