all right so this is the Humane AI pin it is a brand new product and a really really interesting form factor of an ultra futuristic wearable computer so in a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro and wearable glasses it's so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot unfortunately it's also the new worst product I think I've ever reviewed in its current state there's just so many things bad about it it's so bad in
fact that I think it's actually kind of distracting to like understand what the point of the device is as we go through it so I'm going to have to separate it out for this video first I'm going to tell you what it is and what it's supposed to do and then I'll tell you what my experience has actually been  so this thing is a small wearable computer with an AI inside that can help you throughout your day it's about the size of a large watch it has a camera and a microphone and can interact with
the world around you but in case you can't use that as input there's also a touchpad and a projector inside with this super new style of gesture control with the projection on your hand it costs $700 plus a $24 a month subscription plan for the data that comes with it and all the services and all the online storage but yeah $700 plus a subscription it's already a fun start but so one of the big things off the top is this does not pair to your smartphone at all this is its own
Standalone device with its own internet connection with its own phone number and so this little AI assistant it just goes everywhere with you it's always connected and that's you can choose how much or how little to use it alongside your smartphone so you know on its face maybe that's kind of a cool idea at least like the idea is you talk to it like a person it answers questions it gives you historical facts or personalized recommendations or helps you out with things like brainstorming
or remembering things it can make phone calls and send text messages a ton of stuff the unfortunate reality though is this thing is too much of a pain to use to actually want to do most of that stuff alongside your phone but we'll get there all right let me actually start with the hardware this this little thing is the build of this thing is actually impressive like genuinely I think if you're looking for a reason to feel like you're not getting ripped off the hardware packaging actually kind of
accomplishes that like this pin is solid it's aluminum it's dense feeling uh there's three colors actually there's all matte black which is the cheapest one or for 100 bucks more you can get white or this black and silver one that I'm using and then there's a lot of sensors packed up there there's a camera there's microphones there's lights there's a tiny Class 2 laser projector so this whole thing is like really densely packed and then the magnets also that connect everything are super strong
so the back of this pin is called a booster it's another battery so it's got its own internal battery but then once you attach it to your clothes it cleverly through your clothes magnetizes there makes a nice sound when you do and that's how you get it attached so you get two of these boosters and since there's the internal battery you can literally hot swap between them so the thing stays alive very clever and then it also comes with this extremely well-made and also very very reflective
uh charging case so you can pop it in there or just your battery in there keep it topped off that charges via USB type-c this thing is nice and it also comes with this like desktop charging puck where you can magnetize in the battery or the whole thing the pin and the booster at the same time so that is a lot of charging and Battery related accessories but they all come with it and this pin you know it's also got these lights up at the top here that light up anytime you're doing anything
and there's also a small pin light notification for when there's something waiting for you so between the weight of the parts and the strength of the magnets how it all slaps together like you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the craftsmanship of this product which I very much appreciate it's the best part of the  okay I want you to forget about the smartphone in your pocket for a second like just for a minute just pretend that doesn't exist ignore it right this
little pin can do a lot of stuff and is very helpful so again think of this thing as an AI assistant that's like by your side all the time with you so you can ask at things it doesn't have a wake word it only turns the mic on and listens when you touch it so you can go how tall is the Empire State Building and then when you let go it starts sending that query off to the crowd the Empire State Building is "1,454 ft tall to the tip the cloud and" then gets you an answer which is great
and it also is multimodal so that means it can look at the camera and see things and interact with the world around you so look and tell me what you see so it'll scan the room use the cloud again that little noise was it taking a little image sending that image to the cloud analyzing it getting it back then deciding what to tell me you are sitting in front of a camera and a laptop the camera is on a tripod and pointed at you the laptop is open and you are looking at it there are three pictures of dogs
on the wall behind you there is a window to the left of the camera there is a boom mic on the table in front of you  floor great the camera can also take pictures or up to 15sec videos which it auto uploads while charging it can also remember things you tell it to remember and all these things will show up in the Humane Center so that it's like this online web portal for all things connected to the pin there's no app it's just the website so there you can see a whole history of who you've called and
texted and what you've listened to and what answers it gave to your most recent requests and all the things you told it to remember it is pretty well-rounded I think probably it's its best tech demo feature though is the translate back and forth you got a two finger gesture you  where's the library so it autod detects the language translates to English and the person who speaks back can translate back as long as you hold on the pin and listen to them pretty cool this is all
voice stuff though so if at any point you're in a loud area or a very private area and you don't want to interact out loud with your voice that's where this projector comes in so it seems crazy but you activate it like that and then you just hold your finger out your whole palm and it becomes a projector screen for the laser projector built into into the pin so it takes a little practice but eventually you get used to holding your hand up in just the right spot and then the UI gets projected in this green
720p Mini screen on your hand so you basically use your hand try to be as flat as possible and then to interact with it there are some movement gestures so there's a Time oflight sensor that keeps track of movement and you move your hand around kind of like rolling a marble around in your hand to select something then pinch to select you can then make a fist to go back and then you literally push forward to move deeper into a menu so this is like a 3D UI you have to learn this is obviously very
brand new for people but I think to be fair it is pretty intuitive I think if you get a quick 60-second lesson you kind of already have learned all the things you need when you first uh connect the booster to the pin you can unlock it and unlocking it with my pin is like this uh move your hand through space to select the numbers thing it's literally like moving back and forth through a Rolodex of real numbers so it's one of those like borderline magic things where the first time you see it you kind of
just get it and it clicks even if it is a little fidgety and a little bit inaccurate and kind of slow but that  review so unfortunately this thing is bad at almost everything it does basically all the time where do I even start so I guess first of all okay it's supposed to just answer questions right it can kind of do that sometimes but one it's often slow because most of these requests go to the cloud and come back and there's just a long wait and two it's often wrong because AI still can
hallucinate and there are still issues with it just not understanding correctly or just saying the wrong thing and that's not even mentioning server timeouts if you have a poor internet connection which happens to me all the time in this studio so when they do most of the demos like on their websites and in their videos they'll ask a question and then they'll let go and keep talking to fill the silence so it's not awkward as you wait for an answer and realize how long it is but even on this fast
Studio Wi-Fi here who designed the Washington  Monument finding designer the Washington Monument was designed by Robert Mills a prominent 19 century American architect from South Carolina the construction was eventually completed by Thomas so you can just hold your hand up to put your answer on your hand and interrupt that it's talking so much but even that was like a pretty good performance for the AI pin in ideal fast Wi-Fi conditions but there are many many times when I feel like it's way slower and it
it seems like it goes to the internet for almost everything I mean there's a few queries I I guess might be local like what time is it 11:42 a.m. like that's pretty fast if I ask the battery life you can tell me that pretty fast but it feels like basically everything else is just shoveling it off to the cloud not Computing on the device and it takes a while but it's also just wrong all the time like I remember asking it days before the solar eclipse when the next eclipse was and it said 2044 I
asked it what's some good Asian food in the area and over and over again it thought I said what's the best Ash for  finding next Nets game the next Brooklyn Nets game is on Sunday April 14th but no specific opponent or location is provided I just Googled it it says it's the 76ers so that's kind of weird what's the traffic to the Empire State Building  here finding directions use the voice command feature of AI pin to ask for traffic information to the Empire State Building and it will provide you with
the details you need I did this stuff happens all the time but then speaking of battery life really bad and inconsistent which is annoying so it's already kind of bad enough that you have another device that you also have to charge every single day but with this it's actually more than that you have to constantly babysit the battery and swap out boosters and charge this thing and keep it charged multiple times per day so like I said before you get two of these things that come with it and I've had a pin
nuke through the entire booster battery in 2 hours while not really doing much of anything I've also had it last like 4 hours while doing a whole bunch of you know photos and videos and requests and Laser stuff and it's also just like constantly warm the whole time just all the time which is a little bit concerning I'll also say multiple times in various situations I've had it just over heat for seemingly no reason and tell me to wait a while for it to cool down I think the heat problem is also
Amplified because of the Gap created by whatever fabric is between the booster and the product that it is actively inductively charging you know it is a lot of very impressive engineering but wireless charging is notoriously inefficient and loses energy via heat and that's what's happening in here all the time so just the fact that it's warm just this warm Puck on my chest all day was just enough to never quite forget that I'm wearing it well that and the weight look it's it's well made like I
said it's really impressive Hardware but it's it's just a little I mean you see that little sag it's just a little too heavy in the same way that Vision Pro is just a bit too heavy when you're wearing the thing you you you just want to make it as light as possible it's why a lot of the stuff is made of plastic so when you decide to go aluminum instead yeah it's just a little too heavy I feel like Humane in a lot of their videos they've got all these thick fabrics and like
heavy jackets so it doesn't really pull down and sag nearly as much but if you wear some lighter weight materials like I do especially when it gets warm outside this is really going to start to be noticed and yes there are some optional accessories that are lighter weight but you never quite forget about it this pin cannot set a timer this pin cannot set an alarm um this notification light they put up at the corner here it's there and it works but it is basically out of my peripheral my field
of view so I almost never see it and you know they also chose this corner for the light which means it's designed to be worn on this half of the body which is fine and you get used to it there but that's also exactly where most seat belts go in the US anyway so not their fault just another annoying thing about using it the photos look pretty bad and the videos look even worse uh they're squarish in aspect ratio very noisy and they max out at 15 seconds uh The Hub that everything syncs with for me just
randomly stops working and I have to refresh it to get it to work again the projector as impressive as a technical achievement as it is it's just not very readable it's not particularly bright outdoors and it gets dimmer the further from your hand it is because of physics and unless I knew what those words were saying I I really can't read very much and there are no apps um there just are no apps there are so when you first sign up with uh your Humane account you get to sync with four accounts there are
your Apple Google Microsoft and title so the first three are basically for your contacts and then the last one title is the exclusive music partner so there is no Uber access there is no Spotify access there's no WhatsApp there's no calendar no Gmail none none of that stuff it's just it doesn't have I can't book a flight I can't buy something on Amazon it just will not do any of that stuff that just do on my phone so I know I've said like a bunch of the downsides and the problems this
device has but I really genuinely think the biggest problem this pin is going to have is that smartphones are kind of op like that's the number one thing I've reminded myself from the week of using this pin trying to get it to do stuff is that smartphones are not going anywhere anytime soon and I think a lot of the comments online have already picked up on this even without testing and using the pin which is okay there seems like a lot of overlap between what this is and
what a smartphone can do but everything that this pin does a modern smartphone does better and faster and easier and in higher quality and just better in every way like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos and you can frame things more easily of course A phone can call and text people more easily you can use it in more places loud places private places use it with literally any outfit also a phone like you can quickly Google things it's faster to message people back and of
course it can email people and use all kinds of app experiences do you know what happens when you try to just send someone a picture from the AI pin you already know how to do it on your phone with the iip pin okay you take the picture then you either try this with your voice or you pull up the picture which is just a green 720p jpeg on your hand I I guess that's a good enough preview sure you go to send it you pick your contact or type in the whole phone number with the gestures eventually you
go to send and it has its own internet connection and it sends a link to view the picture in the Humane web portal like the difference in how easy how frictionless that is here versus here it's it's not even close and there are honestly many times where I would I'd be trusting this pin like I'm reviewing it I'm living that life I'm using it and I'd ask it something and I would wait so long and my phone would just be sitting right there where I could just pick it up and Google the answer and the time it
takes me to get hopefully the right answer on the pin it's just phones are  or I'll just do this I guess ah it's a cyber Tru the photo is of a cyber truck an electric pickup truck  Tesla yep also I got to say when I say phones are op like screens in your hand so sick just for the last like 10% of any UI like you can get almost all the way there with just your voice interaction but but let's say you call an Uber and you say take me to the studio from an Uber even if it could
do that which it can't but let's say it could and as you're waiting you're like I'm going to just go grab a snack from this Starbucks on the corner how do you adjust your pickup location with the with this ah just that friction of I I could just do it in two seconds on my phone or buying something online is another one I've seen a lot of demos where someone's like plan me a trip to Europe plan me an expedition I even want to buy detergent online on this because I need to check all the
ratings and the titles and make sure I'm ordering the right one I do not trust that with just my voice but I think most critically for the AI assistant part I actually love the idea of a virtual assistant that you can talk to like a human like this is something we've been chasing for years with Google assistant and Siri and Alexa and now with this new form factor of you know a little AI in a box that can be with you everywhere maybe that can deliver even better on that specific promise but the thing
about a good assistant is it needs to know everything about you that's that's even true with a human assistant like it needs to know your schedule it needs to know where you go every day it needs to know who you talk to your preferences are personally and for products like it needs to know everything about you and your smartphone already knows a lot of things about you but this is a stand alone device that doesn't talk to your phone and so it doesn't know any of the things
about you that your phone knows so just from that it's already at such a massive disadvantage for the smartphone for being helpful I mean you can you can do what I did fully immerse yourself for several days straight and it to remember everything and call people text people from it but it's still it will always have that Gap and that's not even mentioning this like I said it has its own phone number and so if you text people and call people from this yeah it can summarize all of your messages from
the day and all that stuff from these conversations but it doesn't see any of these conversations so if you're texting here this is not the same thread that Gap is always going to be there so I guess that begs the question why didn't they just make this connect to your phone everyone has a phone that's the question that I think a lot of people are wondering and I I think this is my Theory but I think Humane wants this thing to eventually be a very powerful Standalone device someday and in order
to get it to that future they can't set the precedent now of connecting it to your phone because then that means they have to remove that fature in the future and they don't want to do that so this device as it exists today is hamstrung by its ideal future version of itself it's like Vision Pro like I talked about it in the Vision Pro Pro review it doesn't actually pair to your iPhone in any way it's its own Standalone computer and of course Apple sees down the road that could just be like a little pair of
smart glasses you don't need an iPhone to use that but now today this thing is a victim of its future ambition it was really hard to come up with a title for this video but I will say at one point my working title for this was this product is either the dumbest thing ever or I'm an idiot because yes it's really really really really bad now but every once in a while and I mean a while I would use it and it would do exactly what it's supposed to do quickly and I would I'd get it and I'd really feel
like that is that's how it's supposed to feel and then I'd do another request and it would remind me of reality but here here's an example right I've said a thousand times like your my best ideas Golden Rule they always show up when I can't write them down like when I'm about to fall asleep or I'm in the shower or driving right so I'm using the pin I'm driving to the studio and I have an idea I'm not trying to write it down on my phone while driving or pull over but I had the pin so I'm driving and I
just remind me of this cool ABC outro idea for the Humane review and I just kept driving and it wrote it down and it saved it memory and when I go check the Humane outro idea for the Humane review has been saved voice is kind of annoying but now that's up in the Humane AI Center so when I arrive at the studio that thing that I told you to remember is sitting there waiting for me that was nice or the other thing the unique firstperson videos I could put it in the center of
my chest and take videos I would never want to distract myself while driving taking a video but you know even though the quality is not great that's the most frictionless version of that along with smart glasses that's great and I think number one on top of all of this is if you ask me like who should buy this device right now I mean nobody should buy this device right now but if if there's one person who would most consider it it's the person that wants to spend as little
time as possible with a screen in their hands like as little time as possible on their phone that's me sometimes I don't want to Doom scroll the second I pull my phone out my pocket for that person if they want that at the expense of everything else this device represents just a glimmer of hope for that future now the problem of course is with this device there's just so much more friction and fumbling and annoyance that comes with it that you don't want to do it even though you would accomplish the
goal of left screen time and living in the moment but yeah that's that's the issue with it I literally had a moment like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day which was like a travel day and I woke up in the morning and I thought like I don't want to deal deal with this pin today like I have driving so the seat belt's going to be annoying and then we're going to go to the airport and then probably got to take it off through the metal detector and then put it on again which means I have to log in
with the pin again and just all this and I just was like I I don't want to have to charge this seven times like I I don't want to wear it today so I skipped it and you should probably skip this product too and never buy a product based on the future promise of updates to it obviously this is a product that has a long way to go and there's a team behind it and look I got to say as a brand new product and a team trying to make something new that I respect I respect the attempt because we don't get
a lot of totally new stuff but yeah this is uh this is a long way to go they do have a road map actually I'll say they've shared it there's some decent stuff on there including number sharing but that also has no date and no other information so I'll just say good luck godspeed thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace
