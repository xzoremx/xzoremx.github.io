so you remember like a year ago when Dyson came out with these things the Dyson headphones combo wearable air purifier nightmare Gadget I tested them I reviewed them I gave it a chance it ended up still being the single dumbest product I've ever reviewed still is so imagine my surprise when Dyson unveils a new product a year later and it's just headphones it's just like they removed the stupid air purifier part and Left Behind the giant metal pair of Dyson headphones that were kind of
overshadowed last time this is them and they are $500 so yeah of course I'm going to give them a shot because you know on the off chance that someone out there was turned off by the super spreader air filter thing but was still intrigued by the idea of a pair of super highend and Dyson active noise cancelling headphones I'm dedicated to giving these a fair shake and the thing is the thing is it might not seem to make much sense until you consider that airpods Max also exist
in fact the more you compare them the more it feels like Dyson just saw airpods Max just getting Dusty sitting in the corner no updates after 4 years still has a lightning Port still super heavy just unchanged and still getting sales at $550 and thought okay well surely that audience is looking for an alternative right and when you put them side by side it becomes actually pretty clear to me that what Dyson seems to have done is aimed to basically one up Apple's headphones in as many ways as they
possibly could while still being in the same exact category of huge heavy noise cancelling headphones so like I said these things retail at 500 bucks but that is 50 bucks cheaper than Apples it has replaceable ear cups for 50 bucks a piece believe it or not that also undercuts Apple the rated battery life is 55 hours which is just dramatically better more than doubles airpods Max is 20 hours also Dyson's headphones work the same on both iPhone and Android and of course these also have a real off
button so yeah uh but anyway I think I have to start with the fact that these headphones are somehow heavier even than Apples these are the heaviest headphones I've ever tested 451 G which is not great on paper but the thing that they at least do well is they kind of they distribute it well across your head now everything on these headphones is metal like not just the ear cups but also the hinges the top band and then basically just this top cushion is super soft the left and right
ones actually aren't super soft even though they look the same and that's because they've put batteries in here so the weight now is actually higher off of the ear cups which is how they manag to be I'd say just just as comfortable as airpods Max they feel different but you know not a high bar they're still super heavy it's just they're not super uncomfortable for sitting around and passively listening for a while and honestly there's actually a lot of interesting sometimes clever design with
these headphones the main one really being these interchangeable back plates and ear cushions I'll get to how they sound don't worry but these ear cups are a quarter twist and an unlock away from being totally replaceable and then these back materials is it's just a cap that is also a quarter twist away from being totally replaceable as well so they can both be replaced with different colors and then you can mix and match different combos of ear cups and back plates now
you don't actually get like a bunch of these with the headphones like I said they're 50 bucks a pair so basically when you go to their website you choose between these four base color combos and I'd say Choose Wisely because then any extras you want you got to pay for so you might have seen what people were doing a few years ago with like mixing and matching different ear cup colors with airpods Max Dyson basically I think saw this but took it to the next logical level and just said all right we'll
build it right in as a feature and upsell you and it's it's fine it works is it a bit of a gimmick kind of yeah sure but you can also tell they put in real work with the lock and twist mechanisms so they don't come off easily but you can also always unlock and swap out a new cap which have lots of different finishes by the way there's the aluminum one one which is really shiny and metallic but the colored ones have like a matte finish they almost look like a colorware collab another
clever little design thing and this actually comes from the previous Tyson headphones is uh this clever little joystick on the back on the back right hand side this is almost all of the physical controls for these headphones and it's great because it has a bunch of functionality you can press in to play pause you can go up or down for volume left or right moves you through tracks and it sticks out so it's easy to find blind you don't even have to see it then the only other physical control is
double tapping the left ear cup to turn on and off noise cancellation or transparency mode unfortunately this control is extremely finicky and only works like 50% of the time which sounds insane Until you realize this is not a touch surface it's just the cap on top of the headphones so I imagine it's some sort of like force sensor so you like really have to smack the headphones to change it yeah that's not great but a couple other small observations uh the chime that plays when you first put them
on is super loud every time I don't know why please turn that down but then these headphones also only twist in One Direction so that way that's how you get them to fold flat although they don't actually totally fold at all so to bring them with you you need this this is the case I mean I guess you don't need this case but this is the one it comes with this is it's basically two flat Boards of silicon connected by some elastic you kind of just push the headphones down right in there you do
have to shrink them down a little bit and there is one pocket near the top for any cables you want to take with you sure that's fine these headphones also have on head detection so they can automatically play when you put them on and then automatically pause whatever listening to when you take them off pretty standard for high-end headphones and they also have multi-point Multi-Device connectivity so I had these paired to both my iPhone and my pixel at the same time and the Dyson app is
pretty solid it lets you change A&amp;C modes and it still does that real time thing where it shows you like a graph of the last 30 seconds of how loud it is outside the headphones versus how loud it is inside the headphones so you can see that Delta when you have noise cancellation on fine cool I guess it's not the most useful feature in the world but it's still cool to look at once in a while but then of course how do they sound they're headphones after all that's what people want to know so as
your resident uh non audio file but someone who has listened to a lot of headphones these sound solid but not amazing uh actually did listen to a lot of backtack with the airpods max because that's that feels like the appropriate comparison here and the airpods sound better in basically every single genre but by like 10 10 to 25% and you can play with the EQ in the Dyson app but there's only three presets so there's neutral that is the flattest most honest representation it is actually
surprisingly neutral enhanced sounds closest to airpods Max and it's pretty good that's my personal favorite for listening to music there's nice big range deep subbase and then still has crisp detailed mids and highs and then base boost sounds horrible but it does what it says if you're into that I think the struggle really is mostly to create like an open like wide feeling Sound Stage the inside of the ear cups actually is pretty shallow it's legit touching my ear with the fabric so it's
just not the widest Sound Stage and there isn't as much instrument separation as I was hoping for but in general they sound like any other Rock Solid B+ noise cancelling headphones would for around like a $300 price point there are also eight microphones all the way around for active noise cancellation and they are decently good at getting rid of some white noise but they are not the strongest like Sony's bows and airpods all cancel way more background noise and then the transparency mode is
okay the real strength of these headphones if you must know is definitely the battery life what they've done with like getting the battery cleverly on the band instead of resting on your ears made a surprisingly big difference and it's a lot of battery this battery life is amazing like I've only had to charge it once during this super heavy use of like week and a half testing I've been doing um yeah like 50 Plus hours withc on is like World beating so great battery life plus they
actually have an off button which they can't all say they do but at the end of the day these are still Dyson headphones like why do these exist that's that's the real question that I've been wondering this whole time testing them and I think the obvious business 101 answer is Dyson spent real R&amp;D money making this stupid pair of headphones that have an air filter attached to them and figured they might as well get their money's worth and also ship something that might have a little bit of a larger
addressable Market which is just headphones so now there's headphones so if you aim these squarely at airpods Max which is what I did I feel like that's the closest thing to them then they don't seem as ridiculous I mean they're built just as well they have much more clever interesting customization going on they have decent sound they also have like a solid physical control and they're much better with batteries so yeah I guess since they're cheaper they make sense but however if you compare
them to basically any other high-end normal pair of noise cancelling headphones in the 350 range from any of the other Majors then yeah these are overpriced straight up so that's the verdict now you know at least the people from Dyson can say they shipped something thanks for watching catch you guys in
