did you know there is a secret part in all of Apple's newest products and this isn't the first time they've done this before so fun fact in every single Apple M3 and M4 product and the M2 iPads there's a secret thread radio that just hasn't been enabled yet see thread is one of the foundational radios in matter the smart home protocol that Google and apple and others have helped develop so Apple can and I suspect probably will enable all of these thread radios sometime in the future all at once to
help you more natively control Smart Homes so I'm telling you this now because Apple has done this before uh second generation iPod Touch remember that thing that turns out secretly had Bluetooth radios inside it that just didn't get enabled until an iOS 3.0 update then boom they all had Bluetooth and also last year Apple randomly turned on the temperature and humidity sensors inside the homepod mini which people found during tear downs but wasn't activated until they turned it on so
yeah it's just kind of weird to see apple stick some parts in a phone or a device for no reason but now when they turn it on you can say I told you so
