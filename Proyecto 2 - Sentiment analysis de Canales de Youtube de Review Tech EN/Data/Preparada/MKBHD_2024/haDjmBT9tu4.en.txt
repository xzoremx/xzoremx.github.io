all right we got to talk about Apple intelligence so Apple's made this promise this huge thing is coming that's going to change everything across their whole lineup they've been talking about it for a while and I think that promise is starting to fade this was first announced at WWDC 2024 that was nearly 6 months ago and it's still not completely out yet the new iPhones launched in September with exactly zero Apple intelligence features but then some software updates have started to push
out and eventually it's supposed to be finished and in everyone's Hands by March 2025 that's a lot of buildup so what I want to do now is review every single Apple intelligence feature that's out so far and then also get into whether the promise that they're actually making is even good in the first place so first up writing tools so all these features unless otherwise specified are on iPhone iPad and Mac so no apple intelligence features at all on the Vision Pro their
most futuristic platform that's already kind of fascinating but the writing tools you may have heard about these since they're definitely referenced a lot maybe the most out of any of these and yes it's basically generative AI to help adjust what you've already written so this is easiest to demo on the Mac but basically you have something you've written you highlight all of it and then select one of the writing tools and actually this is one of the first weird hiccups just a strangely repetitive UI
you can access any of the writing tools in one click right here or hit show writing tools which again shows the same list of writing tools okay so I suppose there's a world where you know you write some message to someone and you just want it to be a little more friendly or maybe you've typed out a bunch of stuff that needs to be sent in a work email so you want to get the AI to make it more professional for you sure I guess so I've run it through various things that I've written from you know whole video
scripts to just a bunch of messages and it works technically I think the the friendly mode mostly uses like shorter sentences and lots of exclamation points and then the professional mode kind of does the opposite like it's it's still pretty tur but never uses exclamation points I think maybe concise is the most useful basically it takes whatever you highlight and makes it maybe 40% shorter and then you can hit copy or just directly replace it if you trust it and each of these things takes about 3 or 4
seconds to generate entirely on device so it works offline as well the proof reading is nice because it picks up on extra things like capitalization and proper nouns if you really need that on top of the auto punctuation checker and then summary or make table would be really nice for like really large documents but it doesn't seem to want to work on some of my huge documents that would be nice to summarize or make into a table so unfortunately even as a basically a professional writer at this
point I haven't gotten much use out of writing tools at all so notification summaries this one to me personally I have found almost useless basically it does exactly what it sounds like it does when it's enabled it summarizes your notifications from each app so if you get a long message from someone or several notifications in a row from a single app it will do its best to condense that all into a single message to help you kind of get the gist quickly so no matter how long or how short the
messages are whether it's just a text or maybe a group chat has absolutely blown up and you missed a 100 messages it's going to try to summarize all that into one or two lines the thing is once I enable it and started using it it it basically seems like the notifications that I'm getting are almost never benefited from being summarized or shortened like I've never gotten four text messages that are perfectly summarized into a single one and I'm sure it's possible there are going to be
some instances where it works for people but it's not just me I've seen lots of examples online and there's plenty of memes too of Apple's notification summaries doing some sometimes hilarious work some BR stuff so it works and I guess it's good for a laugh once in a while but yeah this is a feature I straight up turned off then gen mooji so okay believe it or not there was some hype for this one and once again it's basically exactly what it sounds like it's it's letting you generate any Emoji
using AI anything you want so let's say I'm in messages and I want to react to some message with a very specific emoji that doesn't exist you would describe an emoji so you write your text and then hit create a new Emoji give it about 3 seconds again and it will use generative AI to create that image for you that's fun I guess and yes it will sometimes refuse to make what you ask of it if you ask for something like crazy or graphic although it seems to have no problem making a potato with a gun so that's an
emoji reaction you can send sick it's a very specific use case there's no doubt some people will have fun with it I just think I'm not in the Target demographic to use this sort of thing all the time so again over my head cool it exists but that's it so then image playground is another maybe kind of weird one this is almost the same tool but sort of Standalone this is a playground to generate images in a cartoon style of whatever you want so you open the playgrounds app and again just
describe the image you want in text anything really but before you type anything there are also a number of these buttons down here and they're kind of just inspiration suggestions for things or people to include in the image so yes you can choose any of the people that your phone recognizes from your photos app and that'll be the starting point for the image and then add some themes or accessories or background or props or whatever on top of it so here's me with a hard hat on at a disco and it
generates it again in a few seconds on device always cartoon style never photo realistic and it can give you a few options to choose from and once you hit done you can copy and paste that image wherever you want Google and a few others have this on their devices too just sort of a playground to make some artificially generated images again it's of debatable usefulness of course it makes sense that it won't do photorealistic images because that would open up a whole can of worms uh but it's
even supposed to not do some things that could potentially be offensive again like if you ask it for a gun it typically refuses but I found if you add a few more variables like a chef hat and some fireworks to something then it will be a little more likely to actually pull through for you so yeah good thing it says it's in beta and may create unexpected results this is yet another app that they've added to my phone that I predict that I will probably never use again after making this video so then
priority notifications so okay now this is one that I think had some promise or at least I'm in the Target demographic for it because as an iPhone and Android User you start to notice that Apple's weakness has a long time than notification management if it was just kind of had a fire hose of notifications coming in all the time so priority notifications surfaces certain notifications Above the Rest when you're in a focus mode that reduces notifications but this should also work
in the mail app to put AI identified high priority messages up at the top plus some other categories so if you use the default mail app which I don't but a lot of people do then this could be helpful something Gmail has had for many years and the reduced notifications mode mod also specifically tries to do a good job of only letting important notifications through but keeping the rest quiet so then the photos app uh yes we all hate the new photos app everyone you do I do everyone you know hates it
we're all on the same page it's terrible but Apple has added exactly one AI feature to the photos app and in an age where lots of companies are comfortable adding a ton of AI to their photos apps dozens of things but they've decided all right yeah we can do the background object removal thing we can do that so basically the same thing as Google's Magic Eraser tool let's say you've got a picture with a subject in the front and you just want to remove that annoying thing in the
background you hit the edit button and then on the right side you hit the cleanup tool and a lot of times it will automatically highlight in this sort of rainbow glow the thing that it auto detects that you want to remove but if it doesn't you can just tap or Circle whatever you want and it takes a few seconds and then it just gets rid of it and use a generative fill to fill in the background and of course some scenes work better than others it's kind of the same deal as Magic Eraser or photoshop
typically patterns or repeating backgrounds will give you the best results I'm going to say I actually think this one works better than Google it's better at getting a good outline of the photob bomber or the background object in a single gesture which is nice it's really smart so to me this is also one of the more useful features recording summaries so okay this one had promise but then was kind of confusing to me because when I saw it on the list I was like oh this I would have loved
this as a student this is amazing just one place where you can record things transcribe them and then summarize them and keep them for later that sounds amazing but this is not built into the default voice memos app at all so if you're on a phone call you can turn on call recording you hit that little button down there it'll take a second it'll warn the person that you're on the phone with with a little message this call will be recorded and then from there it'll record everything that gets
said and transcribe it and the transcriptions are amazing it identifies each speaker it is accurate I love this part but then if you care about the summary part this is where it starts to get weird again because you go into the notes app this is where it's saving everything and it shows up as a new note and the preview actually summarizes it right here pretty well but then when you click in there's a whole transcript great and then there's another summary button up here at the top you hit that
and there's a different summary uh and this one's a little worse the first one back in the preview actually picked up and included that I said Ridge wallet the second one didn't get that at all but did get best bu interesting but Apple why don't you bring this to The Voice Memos app this is I I want to be able to sit this down in a lecture or a meeting and have it record things so I can summarize them later that's like the main place I figured this would be useful but it's not there so please
please the only way to initiate this right now is actually to go through the notes app to create a new note and then attach and then create a new recording and then record your audio into there but it just feels like it could be one step easier so okay visual visual intelligence so these last two are kind of the big ones visual intelligence is only available on the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro and you get to it by long pressing that button on the side of those new phones which opens it up it's that
camera control button and when you open it up you get a full screen viewfinder with three buttons a shutter in the middle then ask on the left and search on the right so if you point this at any object or subject and you hit ask that lets you ask chat GPT anything about what it sees and if you hit SE search then it's basically just reverse Google image searching whatever it sees so chat gbt or Google so if you hit the shutter button it snaps a photo and then continues to give you those two items or
a popup menu where you can again either search or ask again pretty repetitive if you ask me but okay while this is a very pretty UI and it works pretty quickly it also isn't anything you know particularly new that we haven't seen before like I was just watching my Galaxy S8 review from back in 2017 where I do a demo of the exact same thing I take a picture of something in front of me it looks it up with Bixby Ai and it could tell you if it was a landmark or a product that you could shop for this is
going to be more capable obviously chat GPT has a lot more capabilities and maybe even a little bit more trust these days than Bixby had back then and it's certainly more well integrated but yeah so it's not something mind-blowing or groundbreakingly new but it is ideally more accurate and more capable than before maybe they're going to continue to build on top of this in the future but then there is chat GPT integration the sort of last but not least new thing that Siri works with chat GPT I think a
lot of people thought there was a lot more to Siri like right off the bat because it has this new animation and you see the new Siri animation so you think it's the new Siri but most of the new Siri stuff isn't here yet but the chat GPT stuff is so if you ever make a request or ask a question that's out of the normal scope of Siri maybe ask for a recipe or you ask for it to make a trip itinerary or something big then it recognizes it and it can prompt you if you want to ask chat GPT instead and if
you confirm then it pulls from chat GPT to respond uh this is all free you don't need an account for this Apple has promised all sorts of masking so your data is not used for training models open AI doesn't get to collect any of this information about you through the requests but you can also sign into your chat GPT account if you want to keep a history of your queries or use higher end model or even go over the daily limit of free queries there's even actually a button
to upgrade to chat GPT plus built into iOS now so it's pretty well considered so yeah the new Siri animation might be fooling some people but really it's other than being able to type to Siri more easily there's really not a whole lot actually new yet with Siri but that brings me to the rest of the things that aren't here yet still that are coming soon with software updates that list is right here there are more Apple int elligence features that are in the works coming soon and honestly Siri is the
main one I'm interested in because it's supposed to be able to take inapp actions it should be able to reach into Apps and take action inside of them which I think could be awesome I think developers could all update their apps to work really well with it and it could be really useful it could differentiate Siri to actually make it useful again um but yeah that's still coming but yeah then from there my take is the rest of the AI stuff really not super amazing or compelling to me just to be real like
the writing tools that seems like a nice safe use of generative AI that's the thing they're sort of talking about the most but I don't even find myself needing to rewrite things that often and like I said I'm not in the Target demographic to use the image playgrounds all that much or gen Emojis all the time the visual intelligence is definitely super useful like three or four times a year for me like when some interesting plant or dog or whatever is in front of me and I want to just figure out what it
is but that's actually funny you remember the the clip from the Apple keynote of that person who walks up to a dog and instead of asking the person walking the dog what kind of dog it is they just go hey can I take a picture of your dog and then they ask the phone what kind of dog it is instead of just asking the person and that to me is the perfect encapsulation of so many of these Apple intelligence features you could use them and they might work really well but should you should you
like you can ask for a more friendly version version of this letter to send to your friend or you could try to write it in a friendly way in the first place like like you can ask Chachi PT to plan a whole trip for you with an itinerary and everything and honestly it's really impressive when it works but are you actually going to just go in blind and just follow the AI generated itinerary if you even like packing like I know there's two types of people when packing maybe some people will just follow the
AI generated prompt but I feel like I'm in the type that kind of wants a little bit more than that I think luckily no matter what I'm packing it always fits in my Ridge travel gear so shout out to Ridge for sponsoring this portion of the video specifically I helped design the new commuter bag for Ridge and I actually I've been dailying this creation for the past couple months we got it some really good water bottle holders on the sides now and I also added a tablet sleeve in the back so if
you've got a tablet and a laptop they both have their own padded slot and then I double down when I'm flying because I also have the ridge c car on which is basically perfect it's weatherproof it's rugged it's got you know these aluminum corner protectors it also has the 360 spinning wheels they're super smooth of course it has a slot for a Tracker in case it's ever separated from you it's incredibly lightweight it's the go-to and you already know that they work perfectly together like a little
ecosystem to create a perfect little travel combo so shout out to Ridge for sponsoring this portion of the video and for letting me design some of these products and some more that are upcoming so you have to stay tuned for those uh but if you want to pick up both the carry-on and the backpack you can get them together at ridge.com MKBHD and get 30% off and they also have their Black Friday sell going on right now but yeah I think apple is going to build on and sort of iterate on hopefully all of
these features like we have the sort of standard set that we're expecting from them now and this is this is the worst they'll ever be they will only get better from here but it is pretty crazy to see how much emphasis is in all of the advertising and all the talk about the newest devices on apple.com as if Apple intelligence is this massive gamechanging groundbreaking new thing you know there are parts of it that are really good I think the background eraser tool in photos is probably the
best we've seen it's better than Google's it's really impressive I think the visual intelligence stuff has potential to be really good but honestly the best thing I think we've gotten from Apple intelligence cuz all the stuff is running on device is bumping up the base memory in everything there's more RAM in every iPhone now and the base memory on every Mac is 16 gigs now which made the base Mac Mini an incredible deal so shout out to Apple intelligence for that either way hopefully a lot more coming
thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
