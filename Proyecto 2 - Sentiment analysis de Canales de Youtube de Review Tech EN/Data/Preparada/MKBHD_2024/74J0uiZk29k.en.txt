this video is AI generated so I just reviewed Sora this was like a week and a half ago it was open ai's video generation model and it was really impressive uh was until Google showed up so they've just unveiled their latest and greatest probably inspired by Sora just getting announced but the scary thing is it's already noticeably better than Sora see Sora would struggle with some predictable things I talked about in my video things like physics and moving objects and vo already seem to be
significantly better at that stuff specifically so Sora would often have dead giveaways just in the movement of things or in the physics of things moving around in a frame and vo would tackle the same prompt and make a much more convincing at least physical version of that movement and so with these starting to show up a lot of people are reacting like oh you know well these are just the best handpicked versions that Google is showing us maybe it's not that much better but I've had
access to V2 for a couple of days now and I've been doing a lot of prompting a lot of back-to-back testing with Sora and yeah it's it's better than Sora now it's certainly not perfect there are definitely still dead giveaways in there of AI generated video especially with garbled text that still happens a lot also when you try to do a whole bunch of things in one scene or really really complicated physics things then it can still sort of break down and also this version that I'm testing doesn't have
nearly as many controls as Sora it feels like they rushed it out to match the open AI announcement but there's no resolution controls or picking the length of the video for example but to me this really feels like the difference between using a little bit of YouTube data that they're getting away with versus owning YouTube and just just using all of it YouTube just added that button I think it's in Labs where creators can opt out of thirdparty scraping of videos for AI training but
that's just third party stuff that doesn't say anything about Google not being able to use it but yeah it's clear that things are already evolving very quickly in the video generation space which as a video creator are are we cooked cuz
