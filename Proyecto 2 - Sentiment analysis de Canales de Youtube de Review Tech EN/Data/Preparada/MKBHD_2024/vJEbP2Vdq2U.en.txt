okay I've been waiting for this for a while as someone who's been on the sidelines of the windows game for a little while now and seeing all this hype and this new matte black laptop that's supposed to be generational it's got me thinking is it legit like have Windows laptops actually caught up to the Apple silicon leap from a couple years ago because this is a new Microsoft Surface laptop and it doesn't have an Intel chip inside it doesn't have an AMD chip inside this laptop has a qual Snapdragon
X Elite chip inside meaning it is an arm laptop now years ago Apple went through this transition from Intel chips to arm chips and it was crazy successful like no one could really match their efficiency and seamless integration the vertical integration the overall package of their laptops just took a Quantum Leap Forward now Windows laptops around the same time actually if you remember kind of tried the same thing I don't know if you remember the Surface Pro X that didn't go so well and so we've
continued to have in an AMD laptop since then but it seems like this one has gone way better so I've been using this laptop for the past couple weeks you might have see me with it on the waveform podcast and I've got a pretty good idea now of what's gone well and what is still a trade-off so the big Advantage the mega Quantum Leap Forward was inefficiency which in a laptop with the same size battery means a dramatically improved battery life and this laptop absolutely got a big bump up
so I remember reading reviews of the last surface laptop with an Intel chip which already had a pretty solid battery life and the Microsoft quote was 19 hours this one's quote is 23 hours but what that's translated to for me basically is all day battery life for mixed use with no worries like that's high brightness web browsing email watching videos research type activities and then ending the day at like 40% easily so I I just really don't think about charging much which is awesome for
a 14-in laptop on paper it's getting compared a lot to the m 3 13-in MacBook Air and it even outlasts it on some synthetic benchmarks which is awesome so that's one success definitely check the box great battery life love that and then the other second success that we were looking forward to was just a well optimized performance and it's not like the super high-end gaming performance I'm not talking about that type of performance but I just mean like a general smoothness and consistency and
Rock Solid performance across all your everyday regular tasks that sort of performance now I'm going to get into app support in a minute but I I basically found this to be a very capable laptop now again I've been on the sidelines from Windows for a bit so I don't have as many reference points "but this is a $2,000 14-in laptop that" can basically do anything I ask of it without breaking a sweat photo editing in Infinity not a problem literally anything in the Microsoft Office Suite
no problem whether you're plugged in or not you know I found the trackpad gestures are pretty smooth the graphics of the whole UI in general are consistent from full battery to nearly dead so using the software that runs natively on it is Snappy and a great experience but that very quickly gets you into the conversation about the downside of switching to arm this is what I was curious about repeating from last time and this actually happened in the Mac world too when they made this
transition the number one difficulty to changing the entire architecture of your computer is actually app compatibility so I remember when the Mac went through this there were basically three types of apps there's obviously optimized apps at the top of the list like that's the ideal obviously all the first party apps are optimized off the bat and apple did a lot of work trying to get as many developers on board as possible to get their apps optimized on arm but then there were apps that were built for x86
but would still work on arm through emulation so they not perform necessarily as well as they could but at least they worked anyway and then there were apps that just didn't work at all so right now for Windows on arm you have these three types of apps again and my assessment is that at this very moment there's pretty good support for Native apps as far as things people use every day but it's definitely still not perfect so okay Photoshop and Lightroom CC run native Chrome Spotify Prime video
Dropbox Zoom like there's a lot of popular apps across the board that just run natively and they're super smooth and they're great they don't hit battery hard at all love that so then there are some apps that I use that don't support Windows on arm but do get emulated so they still work technically so Lightroom classic is a big one my to-do list app of choice is Tick Tick you might have heard of it I've referenced it a few times and it's a great example if you go to their website they only have x86
versions of the app and I downloaded and ran the 64-bit version and it works but it doesn't actually run very well I actually notice some real chop and some lag with certain parts of the UI and it's not even that heavy of an app it's just a to-do list app and there's a long list of apps in this sort of limbo phase where you don't necessarily know if there's going to be an arm native app around the corner or not CU adoption is not super high it's not really a huge incentive for them to make one yet but
you can still use it it's just not going to be the ideal experience it might churn through battery a little bit quickly but it still works but then there are just apps that straight up don't work at all yet um Arc browser uh Google Drive on desktop I Rely heavily on that that does not have any compatibility at all with Windows on arm uh VMware doesn't work a lot of vpns don't work and a lot of games straight up don't run like some of them are uncompatible but also a lot of them
which might have ordinarily run have anti-che software that doesn't run on Windows on arm so the game just doesn't work at all and there's even some apps that actually now that I think about it are compatible but their websites for the companies that make them don't actually highlight or prominently show the download for the arm version so that it's kind of confusing and it's hard to find so it's just kind of all over the place right now so my take here is look if you are at all considering a Windows
arm laptop specifically look up the apps that you have to use and make sure they're at least compatible at least emulat cuz there might be some promises of arm versions coming soon or just statements from a developer I've seen lot of those but just check the programs that you know you're going to need to work because depending on who you are you could be totally covered and fine or totally out of luck so there are a couple Windows arm laptops out there this is the one I obviously chose to
mess with the the premium matte black one with the Snapdragon X Elite um so here's a couple more of my observations scattered from my couple of weeks of using it I got to say the build quality is pretty awesome as they have been with surface for a little while now I love the all metal design The keyboard's Rock Solid big trackpad with excellent haptics just really good fundamentals all around the port selection is all right it's still got that full-size usba and then there's two USBC with the
headphone jack my only real downside I would say with it getting as pricey as it can get is that there is no OLED option so instead it's a 2304 X 1536 120 HZ LCD touchcreen with that 3x2 aspect ratio and I love that it's tall it's just it can't quite match the Deep blacks and contrast of an OLED obviously even though it's a pretty good LCD so I just feel like I basically traded the OLED for a high refresh rate here but I would have liked to have seen an OLED option and then just know that it's not
like it's not like a super high-end gaming PC it's very strong in performance across the board it'll do all the other things but similar to Apple's M Series Laptops like it's a built-in GPU it's not going to be as powerful as a dedicated GPU so don't expect I mean you can still play some games sure but you're not getting this laptop to max out frame rates and Elden ring or something if you study the benchmarks enough you'll find that these chips have a lot of cores but weaker
individual performance on like a single core basis so it's good at throwing a lot of cores at tasks and getting things done and that's nice just note that and it's it's generally pretty good at staying cool and not spinning up the fans which I also think is great and then of course this is also one of the very first co-pilot PCS so it's got the dedicated co-pilot button on the keyboard and so yeah this chip has an npu which does specific AI related processing things like the studio camera
effects that are built into the camera or the forced artificial eye contact in the camera and it'll do it without pulling anything from the CPU or GPU and of course you can always hit that co-pilot button to talk to Microsoft co-pilot ask it anything the same way you'd talk to Bing or chat or Gemini but overall this laptop is a good start I think I mean I've been waiting personally for a premium built matte black Windows laptop for a while on arm and this is that it's actually what
we've been waiting for um I think the question really is does the software you use work on arm like that's the main question you should be considering when thinking about if you're going to buy one of these things now before you go here's a question have you ever looked at a laptop or smartphone and wondered what's going on inside it because Channel sponsor dbrand has your answers now you've seen for years now one of my favorite party tricks has been this sheet of magnet paper you just lay it
down on any device to see where a few of the internals are like the mag safe magnet array or the speaker D Brand's x-ray line takes that magnet paper experience to a whole another level letting you see basically every single component inside your device and yes this is an actual legit x-ray of that device yes dbrand took hundreds of devices to a Metrology lab and literally shot each one of them with a special x-ray machine for maximum accuracy and they also made a light mode version of
every x-ray so personally I am into the dark mode version but hey if you don't want to have to choose if you buy any x-ray skin you'll get the other colorway for free with your order so if that sounds like a good deal to you I'll leave a link for you to check them out below it's dbrand.com xray but yeah that's been it let me know what you think of the surface laptop of the whole windows on arm thing I'll check out the comments but either way let me know catch you guys on the next one peace
