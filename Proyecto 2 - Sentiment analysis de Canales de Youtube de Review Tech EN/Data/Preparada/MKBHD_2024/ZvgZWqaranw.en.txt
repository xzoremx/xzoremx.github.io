you got games on your phone so this is the Asus Rog phone 9 Pro it's the first Snapdragon 8 Elite phone I've tested it also has a 5800 milliamp battery with fast charging and 185 HZ display on the front but nobody cares about any of that because the screen on the back is stilling a show so there's four retro games on the back here all with really great not copyright infringing names so Speedy Runner is an infinite horizontal scroller you flip the phone over the air Triggers on the top of the phone are
your controls and there's a screen and you just uh play this game as if you were on the front of the phone snake Venture is exactly what it sounds like it's snake on the back of your phone but with the triggers again now Arrow Invaders is uh pretty classic you've probably heard of Space Invaders but they can't call it that but same thing scrolling flying through asteroids shooting them down leveling up it's great and brick Smasher is basically just brick breaker with a giant Asus
logo this is the only one I've gotten really good at though this is Peak offline gaming
