so I have been using this M1 Max MacBook Pro for the past 3 years since it came out and it's been great I have felt absolutely no compulsion to upgrade since haven't needed to it's funny most of my work is pretty light but occasionally I will have to edit a video on the go which is then when you know the extra horsepower and the screen and everything about this comes in handy and it's great if I didn't have to do that ever I would just have like an air or a surface laptop something like that but
that range of work is why this has been  far so Along Comes This M4 generation of MacBook Pros and it's the first generation that I have actually been tempted to maybe upgrade to you know they stacked a couple of the right upgrades in the right places for things that actually make a difference to me so let's just get right into it nuts and bolts cuz the first big pillar is performance and the main reason why this new laptop matters at all is that it's got the new generation of M4 chips
inside and we all know the leap from Intel chips to apple cic chips for M1 was generational but since then it's been a sort of more reasonable incremental upgrade going from M1 to M2 then M3 and then M4 so I think it's pretty obvious that nobody with an M2 or M3 needs to upgrade but there's been enough improvements now stacking up upon each other from M1 to M4 that the numbers are now starting to get kind of interesting so just to set the stage this laptop that I've been using is the
M1 Max maxed out basically the best you could get at the time 64 gigs of of unified memory on this system and this unit I've been testing of the M4 Max is also maxed out it's the best you can get now it's 128 gigs of faster unified memory but the cores are all better fast stronger on the new one 3 nomers versus 5 546 gigs per second of memory bandwidth versus 400 just the hardware improvements to get to M4 Max are clearly there so to keep the Apples to Apples comparison going Apple in their
own presentation said up to 2.2 times faster CPU performance than M1 Max and 1.9 times faster GPU performance so we're looking at around twice as fast and the synthetic benchmarks I've run "back this up I got over 4,000 in" geekbench 6 CPU single core which is the highest single core score ever in a Mac by a while and the multicore score was incredible too tops the chart and then GPU has improved a lot to the point where it's bumping up against M2 Ultra not M2 Max M2 Ultra chips the one that's
currently in the Mac Pro so it's pretty clear that on paper yeah these M4 chips are blazing they're incredible um but that's just on paper what about in real life what about real workflow stuff so on YouTube you might have noticed a lot of the benchmarking and real world stuff that you see is video editing benchmarks just because that's the most intensive thing most YouTubers do on their computers it's the most intensive thing I do um but yeah that's that's what's going to drive my purchase decision so
that's the first thing I looked into so my own Benchmark is literally loading up a video project in Final Cut Pro moving things around messing with Clips cutting effects tracking and then of course export times this project here is a mix of 8K red raw footage and action camera footage with comped graphics and smaller video files from the Snapchat glasses and not only did this laptop open and flip through Final Cut faster than any other machine I've ever used but it also
exported the final video roughly twice as fast as my M1 Max laptop which is really exciting for me so pretty prime example of the performance unlocking something new is uh Final Cup Pro 11 just came out and I've been messing with it for a little bit and there's a new headlining feature called magnetic mask and my theory is that it's taking pretty heavy advantage of Apple silicon specifically the neural engine because it's AI powered but I have to prove it so so previously to cut a subject out of
a background in a video it it was this painstaking process called rotoscoping where you're essentially manually drawing the mask for every single frame now this one works even better than some plugins I've used like M Roto Ai and it's even faster basically all you do is click the subject and sort of refine your selection and then once you're good to go you just analyze forward for the entire clip and just let it do its thing and it just continues for the whole clip so I ran through this on the M4 Max I
ran through this on the M1 Max but I did some other machines as well and the results well the M1 Max was able to pull this off in 2 minutes 56 seconds the M4 Max got it down to 2 minutes and 13 seconds but then M2 Ultra got it down to a minute and a half but then the Intel zon Mac Pro super expensive with the Dual Radeon Pro gpus took 6 minutes for the same 45 second clip here so the leap is crazy and it just keeps getting better I'm thinking M4 Ultra is going to be as a video editor pretty sick but of
course you might not be a video editor you might be something else you might be a photographer I just watched Tyler stallman's video on his M4 Max laptop it's really good the second half of his video he does a lot of testing against the M1 generation with Lightroom and resolve and not only does it continue to crush M1 Max but sometimes it actually gets close to or beats the newest Mac Studio with M2 Ultra which is pretty insane so I'll link his whole video below it's really good now obviously we
expect Mac Studio and Mac Pro to eventually get their own M4 generation updates with the M4 Ultra chip I'm sure that'll be immense but even so with this it's crazy to see apple silicon is still improving fast enough that this new laptop chip is outperforming some of the desktop chips from earlier years of Apple silicon there's a bunch of other real world benchmarks out there I'll link some more below that are really good but I think the bottom line from my testing and from other tests that I've
watched and read is yeah there there is now a significant bump up in performance from M1 to M4 not just 30 or 40% but like 200% which is pretty crazy but that by itself might not be enough to convince you to upgrade so there's more luckily several other things are updated about this laptop as well so first of all this laptop is space black as you may have noticed which the M1 generation didn't have but it's not exactly new it's actually had the same two colors as M3 space black or silver I do love me
some space black but anyone who has one already knows it looks really good new but then it kind of collects fingerprints and starts to wear over time still the best solution I found is a skin over a case just adds that little bit of scratch protection you'll never see fingerprints again so I'll leave a link below to channel sponsor dbrands glitch skin if you want to check that out it's much more interesting than black or silver but there is another visual Improvement here too and you've
probably noticed it watching this video it looks so good that is the nanotexture display option it is new and I love it it's it's incredible and the thing is I have slight reservations about how it might wear over time but on a laptop like this it it just looks so good Nano "texture started out as a $1,000 option" on the pro display xdr and this is the hardest one to recommend like it's stupid expensive and then it's also it's so delicate to maintain it just picked up fingerprints so easily you'd have to
have the right low pile soft microfiber to actually clean it like it's tough I wouldn't recommend it to most but it seems like it improved since then because now it's a $300 option on the studio display that a lot of people have then they offered it as a $100 option on the iPad Pro which obviously that's something people are touching constantly with their fingers and we haven't really seen too many issues with it so I think on a laptop like this like if it can be jeez if it can be like maintenance
painfree then it feels like a kind of a no-brainer like this is my favorite option on this laptop like you're going to take it all over the place and all sorts of different lighting and just the way this matte finish just eats Reflections and completely removes any lighting environment ractions from anything from an office building to a coffee shop to an airplane with a window next to you like it's actually incredible it's awesome all laptops should have something like this it's a
100 bucks more than the glossy version for the MacBook Pro and I'll take it every time the fact that this is new to the M4 Generation by itself honestly is is very compelling to me so then the only other big thing that's new here is Thunderbolt 5 which it's funny it's kind of uh overrated and underrated at the same time so the outgoing laptops all have perfectly great very fast Thunderbolt 4 USBC ports love that almost every new high-end laptop has that um these new ones here getting
Thunderbolt 5 which a lot of other machines don't have yet and actually the the base 14-in MacBook Pro gets one more Port too which is great so now they all have the three Thunderbolt 5 ports it feels a bit underrated maybe because it is so new and it's in so few laptops but it is actually a genuine capability Improvement like we love more bandwidth we love faster I/O you can do three 6K displays from this laptop instead of two so that's awesome but there are so few Thunderbolt 5 accessories out right now
and the ones that do start to come out you'll also notice are uh pretty expensive so my favorite accessory in the world right now for example I think is the Samsung X5 the Thunderbolt 3 drive it's incredible 2800 megabyte per second read speeds they don't sell them anymore but you can get a nearly equivalent 2 tbyte sandis drive for about 275 bucks right then there's the new OWC Thunderbolt 5 drive and it'll "read and write at 6,000 megabytes per" second damn but it's also 2 tabt for 400
bucks so you know as a video editor who's passing around really large files like I'm going to want one of these at some point I'm going to wait for more options it's it's going to be great but I think the point of Thunderbolt 5 on these computers is that ecosystem of Thunderbolt 5 accessories drives docks interfaces that's going to be built up over time is great for future proofing the thing but it doesn't actually affect most people right away unless you're literally going to plug in three Pro
displays right off the bat so then there's a couple other little smaller things you know the the new center stage ultrawide webcam that will follow you around I actually think it looks better which is nice the battery life is also rated to be slightly better thanks to the m4's improved efficiency so I think this is mostly going to come into effect under lighter workloads but you love to see it same size battery better battery life and then the screen has a higher SDR Max brightness of a thousand nits
over the previous I think it was five or 600 so if you're in a brighter space whether you have Nano texture or not everything is more readable and it turns out Apple quietly updated all these MacBook Pros to quantum dot displays and didn't tell anybody they're probably still on their way to OLED but yeah these improvements to quantum dot and efficiency and especially responsiveness it might just be confirmation bias but I feel like the responsiveness is actually noticeable to my eye so you might not
upgrade just for the performance improvements but they are pretty good you might not upgrade just for the new nanotexture finish but it is really good and you you definitely won't upgrade just for Thunderbolt 5 or just for the slightly brighter display or the ultra wide webcam but I think all of these things stacked on top of each other combined is I think you you actually can justify an upgrade this year if you are regularly pushing this laptop to its limits you can justify this Improvement
or at least that's what I'm telling myself M1 Max is going to be perfectly fine for another year though no question about that I also think it's really interesting that we basically have apple intelligence to thank for all of these new Macs basically having a new minimum of 16 gigs of unified memory it just makes all of the base Macs feel like a better deal now and the Mac Mini is amazing and there's more to come we know there's going to be more M4 chips on the horizon but is's a really good new
laptop thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace
