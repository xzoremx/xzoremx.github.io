you know if you've been watching my videos you've noticed a certain sentence that I've been saying for years I've been saying small Flagship phones are a rare breed and I said that countless times over the years but today that's no longer true that breed is now  phone okay we don't even have to rewind that far to the days when phones were all smaller across the board but then really quickly we shot up to 4in screens then 5in screens were popular then 6-in flagships were everywhere we never quite
got to 7-in phones being mainstream but seems like all the biggest flagships now are teetering right around that but the funny part is smartphone manufacturers have had the same realization over and over again which is that oh smartphone screens are getting bigger and so there's room for the smaller alternative phone to slot in underneath that so like I just reviewed every single Samsung Galaxy S ever the year that they started to get really big they of course also introduced a Galaxy S mini it's the most
Samsung thing ever but guess what now that's dead same thing from Apple we finally got huge iPhones and then sure enough we got an iPhone Mini for 2 years but now that's dead too and this kept happening and happening all over the place until there was basically just one good small flagship phone left the Asus Zen phone The Rare Breed so this thing the Zen phone 9 came out in 2022 and was a nearly perfect flagship phone like seriously Flagship specs incredible performance physics defying battery life
like Rock Solid cameras this phone won my small phone of the Year by a landslide even with the few tiny flaws it had you know the back material being a little less durable and it didn't have wireless charging so then in 2023 they came out with a squel the Zen phone 10 and that took a good thing and basically perfected it they fixed the back material they gave it wireless charging they upgraded it to the latest Flagship chips they didn't lose anything nothing went wrong it was just the singular
excellent flagship phone with a less than 6-in screen in 2023 so now it's 2024 and the New Zen phone is a gigantic 6.8 in Ultra phone now honestly we probably should have seen this coming right when has a small Flagship ever lasted more than a year or two right but it just I don't know it hits a little harder when this was the last small one like here here's something to think about right I think apple is You could argue one of the best supply chain companies in the world right that's how
they built their business that's how Tim Cook took the stock price from here to here that's that's what they do Tim Cook is a supply chain guy so every time they come out with a new product or range of products they have to do the supply chain thing and figure out exactly how many they need to produce so they have these complex studies and their ways of estimating how many they think will be sold of every single skew and then that's how many they need to make not too many just the perfect amount perfect
Inventory management that's the supply chain thing that's that's Tim Cook's thing so in 2020 for the first time Apple decided to release a new lineup of four new iPhones it was iPhone 12 iPhone 12 Pro the 12 Pro Max and the 12 Mini of course the 12 and the 12 Pro are the same size right in the middle this nice little sweet spot of the lineup and the 12 Pro Max just being this absolute maxed out biggest screen biggest price but then the cheapest most pocketable new iPhone in the lineup is this cute
new little Min phone now Apple Tim Cook the all the supply chain knowledge and the studies they've put in they already know small phones don't sell particularly well so they make all of their changes and line up how many of each they're going to produce and then they send it they send it all into production and you know reviews honestly for the most part were super positive across the board people love the mini phone yes the battery life is weaker on the smaller phone but to put a flagship
shape and a flagship chip and a flagship camera in a mini phone it's just such a rare thing so it was it was extremely well received Tech reviewers love it real users are loving it YouTube videos are loving on the thing and the mini iPhone still still sold dramatically less than what Apple had prepared for it to there are some surveys that have the mini iPhone at like 5% of the total sales of the entire new iPhone 12 lineup sometimes even less I mean it was it was really really unpopular in the grand
scheme of things to actually buy an iPhone 12 mini so suddenly it went from being the darling of the lineup to the least successful new iPhone of all time and the headlines were all over this and sort of wondering if they would even try this again and they did for one more year they did an iPhone 13 mini it did even worse than the 12 mini and then it was quietly discontinued and guess what was in its place a brand new plus-sized iPhone because of course so the moral of
the story is the mini iPhone experiment reinforced what we already knew which is not enough people actually buy small phones to be worth it for a company even of Apple size to put in all the research and development to keep making these things like people think oh this thing is getting positive reviews so it must be a success not always true and also the counter if things are getting negative reviews from YouTubers that must be why it died also not always true so now here we go with the Zen phone now
here's the thing not to Discount the Zen phone 11 Ultra it's actually a really good phone in fact it's a perfectly fine large flagship phone it brings all the good things about zenphone 10 to a bigger scale bigger battery awesome battery life the latest chips and specs again lightweight software and smooth smooth performance Rock Solid cameras it actually added a third telephoto camera so it's all here it just loses the biggest thing or I guess the smallest thing that really made it different just
the fact that it was actually small and reachable from corner to corner and didn't require huge Pockets or huge hands to comfortably daily it all of that is gone and now it's just like a Rog phone minus the gamer stuff actually seriously that's basically what it is this is the new Zen phone next to the new r phone if you take away the screen on the back the 165 HZ display the side USBC Port the shoulder triggers honestly it's basically the same phone so this Zen phone just feels like it's blending
into the sea of other giant phones if I was guessing zenphone 9 and Zen phone 10 despite how much we love them didn't sell very well and so they moved on kind of the same way that iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini didn't sell particularly well the last part of that equation the fun fact is even today the most popular new iPhone is still the pro and pro Max the super high-end biggest phone and so what did Asus do they made a super high-end big phone now to be perfectly super clear Asus technically hasn't confirmed
that they're not going to make a regular zenphone 11 but the body language suggests that this is the only one they just sort of rename name it the way Apple just stopped making the mini and started making a plus we just assume the mini is gone so there's no solution to this it's uh right in line with the uh the Enthusiast phone dilemma whenever a phone manufacturer comes along and starts making an Enthusiast phone it gathers a really really hot audience for that specific device but it's small and
so when they end up trying to Branch out and make it more successful they lose the core fans and I don't know if Z phone's going to lose the core fans but people who like it for being small certainly aren't going to like this one anymore and this even applies to budget phones too you know small budget phones are getting bigger pixel 7A is a 6.1 in phone the nothing phone 2A that just came out is literally an ultra sized phone and uh rumors of the next iPhone SE also point to that being not small so
the void is now open you know someone might come along and make another small flagship phone to briefly fill that void but don't expect it to last too long
