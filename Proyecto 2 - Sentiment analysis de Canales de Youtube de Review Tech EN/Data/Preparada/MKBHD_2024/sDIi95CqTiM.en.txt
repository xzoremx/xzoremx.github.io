okay so I was listening to the wired podcast this morning and they said something that really nailed the way I think about a lot of emerging Technologies especially AI what they said was WWDC which we just had from Apple basically proved that AI is a feature not a product and this hit so hard for me because that's a that's the exact question that we've been asking ourselves for so long here about new stuff is it a feature or a product so I'll give you an example do you remember
Clubhouse we've talked about this before but Clubhouse back in the 2020s like the pandemic era it was this meteoric rise to success there was this platform that was just live audio stage events that would disappear after they were over and that's kind of all it was it was super simple but with everybody sitting at home it blew up in popularity it Skyrock to the top of the App Store everyone starts using it it had major interviews happen on it major new weekly shows were created on it there were huge famous
people participating in clubhouses regularly but fast forward literally one year maybe two and suddenly Spotify had built this feature into their app uh Discord had built the feature into their app they built stages uh slack had built it into their app even Twitter had built it into their app they've got spaces now and so suddenly it was just a feature inside of these larger apps so the question became is Clubhouse this huge thing that came out of nowhere is this a product or is it just a feature and it
turned out the success of all the features and all the other apps I built it in meant that Clubhouse would just die like and a lot of the other ones eventually ended up dying I think we still have Twitter spaces but generally it just became a feature and there are actually many examples of these which is why the product versus feature question still keeps coming up over and over again so now the newest question is AI a product or a feature because we got to see what it looked like as a standalone
product like we just had in 2024 we had the Humane AI pin which was a dedicated piece of Hardware specifically for engaging with an AI we got the rabbit R1 another device that promised to be like this physical embodiment of an assistant you have everywhere now both these devices were bad and they didn't work very well but let's say they did let's say they actually worked well and we're fine that would be AI as a product and you could even consider like going to the chat GPT website and using it there
as AI as a product but then fast forward now to just a few months later and we just had Apple's WWDC and we also just had Google IO and very different approach like look what happened with apple just like clockwork they went through and systematically added all these AI features sprinkled throughout a bunch of its operating systems so for example in inside of any app with the ability to write text you now have these writing tools that pop up that are powered by these new language models
that can help you summarize or proofread or change the tone or style of your writing and then there's also a new Siri you know powered by these language models again so it can hold conversations better and understand context better and use a semantic index to parse info about various files and things on your device and bring them into series understanding you can literally generate images as a feature on your device you can generate emojis the list goes on but the point is it's
clearly a very different way of thinking about AI for the consumer where it's just one of the features built into the thing that you use now I realized this isn't a Perfect Analogy I think probably the biggest flaw being that you know when they integrated these features like when slack when when Twitter built spaces when they built these features they didn't integrate Clubhouse into those bigger websites they actually just took the IDE idea of what Clubhouse is which is just a live audio event on
stage and they built it themselves into their own apps so Clubhouse was left to die but in this specific case with apple it's actually a combination of two things it's a them building a bunch of their own models to do a lot of these things on device but then also them literally building a chat GPT rapper into a lot of their OS so chat gbt actually gets more users this way so I thought this was fun to think about now now there is no answer yet as far as is AI actually a feature or a product which
one will win which one will lose we don't know but I think if history is any indication I do think that more people in the long run are going to end up using this AI stuff as a feature more than going to like a standalone thing like I was looking back for other examples of this and I honestly found it really hard to find any examples of the other way around happening where the individual product becomes far more successful than the same idea being baked as a feature into something larger
like I think Tik Tok is maybe the best example of this opposite version where Tik Tok is it's it's a vertical video Carousel with an algorithm that learns really quickly what video you want to see next right that's what Tik Tok is like we've seen Instagram reals develop that exact same thing now it's a huge feature for them same thing with YouTube shorts we've got all of YouTube but inside of YouTube is this vertically scrolling Carousel with an algorithm but I still think today we would say Tik Tok
is the most popular version of that idea so the Standalone version is winning currently over it being built in as a feature and maybe Snapchat is another one kind of like Snapchat stories was one of the biggest features in Snapchat and then that kind of got ripped into being a feature everywhere else like everyone has stories but Snapchat by itself is doing well but anyway the question is do you have to get all the way to the level of snap Snapchat or Tik Tok in order to be successful as a
standalone product to defeat the fact that your thing could just become a feature somewhere but yeah that is now the question with AI it just struck me as such a difference in approach between the product and the feature version of it and uh it also struck me that yeah it feels like rabbit and Humane were kind of doomed from the start because there's no way they would also develop all the other benefits of the big things those being smartphones but also one more quick thing I wanted to highlight that I
don't think got as much attention as it maybe deserved which is all of these models that we've been talking about with WWDC all the models Under the Umbrella of Apple intelligence the diffusion model the image generation model the language models are all built by Apple like there was a whole moment on Twitter with a lot of confusion over just how integrated chat GPT is into iOS I think it's actually not really that integrated at all so Apple had to go through the work of obviously making all
these models but also training them all and so we've asked Apple about this they've had to go through finding publicly available data and Licensing and doing that whole dance and spending the millions and millions of dollars required to make these models work so that is a really higher barrier to entry but it's only the once in a while that the request is complex enough or deals with enough real world data which isn't in Apple's training that it actually asks okay can I go out to chat GPT and
it asks every single time which feels about as integrated as it gets but generally I think this is going to be something that's really hard for other companies for any new companies to pull off this might be the last big set of models we get to see so unless you're Apple or Google or Microsoft or open AI or any of the other massive ones that are safe because they'll get integrated now you probably don't have much of a shot but either way this been really interesting to think about AI is it a
product or a feature can it be both or does it have to be one or the other and one wins and the other loses let me know what you think in the comment section below we'll hang out there either way thanks for watching thanks for subscribing and I'll catch you guys in
