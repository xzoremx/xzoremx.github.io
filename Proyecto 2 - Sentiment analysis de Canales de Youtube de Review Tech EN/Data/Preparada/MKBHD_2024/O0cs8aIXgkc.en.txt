the most dangerous thing about the Tesla cyber Tru is not the pointy edges and Corners it's not the fact that it weighs over 3 tons and goes from 0 to 60 MPH faster than a Corvette it's not even the way that Reflections glare off the stainless steel and can blind people on the highway no the most dangerous thing about the Cyber Tru is the way it makes    yeah okay I genuinely can't tell if the cybertruck is goodlooking or not and I'm being completely serious like if you just check the comment section online
it's actually mostly negative most people are saying it looks horrible looks like a refrigerator on Wheels it's a disaster of a design but once you start living with this thing you drive around with it and you talk to people about it who have never heard of it they're saying things like this this is crazy this is like a movie prop it's sci-fi looks something alien so so there's a lot to it here first of all stainless steel and black plastic that's mostly what you're working with here and
the front I think it has a good angle to be honest I'm a sucker for a light bar but the actual headlights are down here so they stay out of people's eyes and general it's like a square jawline no curves just angles but the back the back not so much you know it's still technically a bar yes but it's a little bit dinkier in my opinion and also just tons of black plastic in the back really high tailgate I'm getting like dump truck vibes from back here I don't think I'm the only one I just I don't think
the back is its best angle but if I had to narrow it down I'm pretty sure the most iconic profile is the side and the two elements of this truck that really stand out are this slope these high shoulders and then the pointy corners on the other side see most pickup trucks have basically this G en shape it's the traditional pickup truck look and so we're not used to seeing this angle right here and this huge slope right here it's unusual it's weird it's very visually interesting so I've been living
with the Cyber truck for about a month now well over 1500 miles and you notice a couple things first of all people whenever you go park somewhere always want to come up to you and talk about it naturally I've entertained a lot of these conversations cuz they're fun and they usually say say two things one you'd be surprised how many people have never heard of the cybertruck I know for Us online people people watching this video you're like how could anyone have not heard of the Tesla cybertruck but
you'd be shocked and two most people just want to know how much does that thing cost and uh I got asked that so many times eventually I just started having people guess and 100% of the people who guessed were too high people were guessing 250 300K 180k 150k they're all way over but you know how could they know they don't know what the rest of the truck is they've just seen this thing they've never seen for the first time and so I guess the conclusion is the looks are really distracting people
from the rest of what makes the Cyber truck the cybertruck okay let's play a little game I'm going to name a feature and all you have to do is think about it for a second and think about if you believe it's overrated or underrated and then I someone who's been driving this truck will tell you the real answer so first feature steer by wire I've seen a few good pieces cover what's actually happening here talking about the complete physical disconnect between the steering wheel you're holding and the
wheels that are moving under the truck instead it's a bunch of sensors reacting to your input like a video game controller but combined with the variable steering ratio and the four-wheel steering this is the most Nimble agile feeling truck that I have ever driven and I don't think a lot of people realize that so I'm going underrated it's one of those things where Tesla definitely didn't have to do this like they've made their headlines already with the looks that could just
be a model 3 underneath but they went through the extra measures and the extra engineering to ship a full steer by wire system and all the redundancies that come with making it safe I I believe they're the first ones to do this but the variable steering ratio is really what gives it all of its utility so at low speeds the ability to turn really quickly gets dialed up it's a much more responsive feeling steering wheel so if I want to turn right here I only have to give it uh what half a turn quarter turn
and I'm fully maneuvering the way you can pull into parking spots and make 90Â° turns and everything is a total game Cher but then at highway speeds it softens that ratio a lot so you have a little bit of steering input to sort of Glide left and right between different Lanes it's much more subtle you kind of need that but then on top of that throw in the four-wheel steering so four-wheel steering is not new lots of vehicles have done it but the amount of steer that you get from these rear wheels is
pretty dramatic to the point where you can look in the mirrors and see those wheels turning and this can also be adjusted with software but that really lets this huge truck basically pivot around a much smaller axis the steering ratio now I think gives it the same steering Circle as a Model S but it feels really really impressive just because of how big the actual vehicle is it definitely takes some getting used to you can't ignore that fact but once you get used to it you you literally feel
like when you go back to like an F-150 or any other truck where you have all this hand overhand steering to do the K turns that feels weird it feels archaic feels like you shouldn't have to do that so again Tesla definitely didn't have to do that but just the way you can drive it like a smaller car and really point the nose I don't know it's definitely underrated all right next feature bulletproof stainless steel overrated or underrated I'm I'm going with you probably saw this one coming I'm going
with overrated now look first of all I get it obviously having a very durable truck is super useful of course but bulletproof up to 9 mm  rounds yeah I'm not going to test that but you know there are some other YouTubers out there who totally will and apparently it can literally stop smaller rounds without being punctured but also the glass windows aren't bulletproof they're more of just stronger than regular glass and then it's regular Wheels regular tires that can still get
slashed so don't go getting any ideas that this thing is Invincible or anything like that but clearly cold rolled stainless steel alloy is going to be much stronger than the regular outside of a vehicle so that's the shopping cart in the back of the parking lot that's fender benders or if someone hits you you'll be fine you'll be fine but guess what it also means your truck is now made of an extremely fingerprinting material and it also doesn't have normal door handles so you
just cannot keep it clean if you use this thing daily and then steel just happens to be really hard to manipulate apparently Tesla had to create new machines strong enough to stamp this material together there's a reason why there aren't a bunch of other cars rolling around looking like this so when I say in the autofocus review that low Vin cyber trucks will have have low Vin production issues that's not actually new to Tesla they've had to spin up manufacturing for different types of
vehicles before and usually the first few thousand of them aren't pretty but then they learn from those issues and then one or two years down the road they're making millions of the thing and they're much better quality control so this particular cyber Tru is the dual motor all-wheel drive this was borrowed from Ridge shout out to Ridge by the way I'll leave a link below if you aren't caught up on my partnership with them but on deliv this one had a pretty big panel gap on
the driver's side door and you know I never really care about panel gaps but this one in particular actually started growing and getting worse it literally looked like the door was open and then it started making weird noises while closing until one day it actually broke so turns out it wasn't a panel Gap it was actually a manufacturing issue where the bolts that hold this latch in place were actually not torqued tight enough and they loosened over time and it fell hell out and so Miles actually had the
bright idea to just Gaff tape the latch securely back in place and now when you close the door lines up perfectly so Elon Musk addressed this on Twitter after my video apparently only 15 trucks had this issue so lucky me I guess so if you are one of the few then you can apparently just take this to a Tesla Service Center and they'll be able to fix it in no time as long as you get an appointment the cyberbeast that I took delivery of under my name has been Flawless so far
but I think the point I'm trying to make is these early cyber trucks as with any other early Tesla they're going to find I guarantee you more issues like this and they'll work on them and fix them but yeah this Foundation series badge right here kind of clouded in the Tesla Community because it basically means you got one of the first few but it also kind of means willing baited tester in a way so you know these materials and this new stamping technique and all this should eventually make the vehicles much
easier to produce in Mass and cheaper but that's eventually eventually all right next feature truck stuff I'm talking about the theoretical reasons why someone would logically buy a truck over any other vehicle like a van or an SUV or a car that would be for towing hauling and off-roading and I know it looks like this truck would be amazing at all of that stuff but I'm going to say that that this one it's overrated it's overrated here and I'll tell you why and don't get me wrong the Cyber Tru very
capable it's much more capable than any other Tesla obviously I can confirm it handles winter weather really well like it has heated windshield wiper and the heated mirrors and the door can in fact open in icy weather they added a Wade mode that lifts the suspension all the way up and pressurizes the battery so that you can drive through really deep water it's insane and it also has off-road driving modes and going modes right here in the settings there's also only one wheel and tire option right now
with cybertruck every single cybertruck ships with the same Goodyear territory Wrangler RT Tire whatever it's a pretty popular tire and they ship them on you know Jeep Grand Cherokees and F-150s all the time and it's reinforced and it's capable of some light off-roading but I think if we're being honest most people will be driving this thing mostly on the street like a glorified SUV so here's a number to think about 63 63 is the percent of truck drivers who admit to rarely or never towing
anything at all and that's just the ones that admit it like look at this chart this is from a survey of F-150 owners so the most popular truck in the country people are almost never actually towing with these things so before you leave a comment that this thing sucks for towing yeah they know we know everyone buying it kind of should already know if if you're buying a truck specifically for towing then you have a short list of trucks you're considering and none of them are electric but I think my main
realization with this thing is there are millions of pre-orders for this thing right now because it's Tesla it's going to be very popular this is going to be a lot of people's first truck and it will come with all of the first truck realizations like to a lot of people the Cyber truck looks absolutely huge but it's actually smaller than an F-150 and these people when they get the truck they'll think they're invincible and they can drive off Road and just go wherever they want without even thinking
about strategically going certain routes or airing down the tires that literally come at 50 psi from the factory they're going to start getting stuck in all sorts of embarrassing situations which means of course then there will be countless articles written about them because of course no other truck has ever been stuck in the snow before and it's just sorry I'm I'm definitely getting ahead of myself but look we will be using a cyber truck at our Video Production Studio for a lot of the same
reasons that we've used an r1t it's got a tow hit it's spacious it holds a lot of gear it's quick it's quiet it's great but I think the point I'm trying to make is most of the millions of people who will end up with these cyber trucks eventually are going to use them on the street just like a glorified SUV just cuz they think this one looks cool and  fine all right next category performance overrated or underrated well you might have seen this little video that Tesla did on their
YouTube channel racing the Cyber truck against a Porche 911 while towing a 911 and beating that 911 and that that was a very clever video it's an ad of course but it also takes advantage of the fact that EVS all have this commoditization of this enormous straight line performance great acceleration anyone can get it but you know I'd normally never compare a pickup truck        so like most drag races this one was just for fun but while we have some time at the drag strip we did a bunch of
these we did backto backto back races and it shed a lot of light on Tesla's video and on the cybertruck in general so first of all EVS are quick right we've known this for years ludicrous mode then plaid mode beast mode this is not new information but cars with gears can be faster so that's there's a difference between quick and fast so when you go to a real drag strip with timing equipment and all that stuff you get one of these after there's a time slip breaks down in both lanes not just
the end of the quarter mile but multiple points along the race and so I've expanded it here so this was the triple motor cyber truck's best run one of the first runs it runs a 10.9 Second quar Mile which if you don't know is absolutely ridiculous there are Bonafide sports cars that don't run in the 10s "and for a 7,000 pound pickup truck to do" it on allterrain tires is just kind of hilarious but when you actually look at and break down each of these times this shows the difference between quick and
fast so first of all off the launch just from 0er miles an hour the cyberbeast with its triple Motors and with its thousand hzz traction control managing the slip at the rear wheels basically in real time is able to explode off the line through the first 60 ft of the race faster than the 911 Turbo S one of the fastest launching cars ever made now from there it holds that lead continues putting down all this power all the way out to 330 ft so you can see that at 330 ft 4.4 versus 4.5 it's still out ahead
but by the time you get to 660 ft which is roughly halfway through the race that's when the 911 has changed gears twice and continues to pull and this is when it shifts and passes the truck around halfway through the race physics just takes over and the lighter car with many more gears continues to shift it passes the truck crazy enough the Cyber truck hits its 114 mph electronically limited top speed probably because of the tires uh well before the end of the quarter mile while my child I mean the
car continues to pull into the 140s no it's not stock NOW Tesla made this video that I talked about and they wanted to showcase the cyberbeast against a Porsche 911 and they know all of this so they had to get clever I'll say so if you haven't seen it I'll link it below their video shows the cybertruck pulling up to the line it's racing a Porche 9911 it beats the 911 in a drag race and then it's revealed that it was towing a 911 the whole time so they're saying you can beat one while Towing one and then it
flashes the quarter mile time on the screen 11 seconds so first of all there's about 50 different models and variations of the Porsche 911 so just based on what we saw and from the performance in the video I'm going to guess that they went with the cheapest and slowest possible 911 so that would be the 911 Carrera t it's a manual transmission it does 0 to 60 in around 4.3 seconds so now the cybertruck with its 2.6 second 0 to 60 has a massive advantage and so they're able to
handicap it by having it tow the 911 "like 3,000 lb okay so then they run the" race and if you watch the video they run it out to this yellow Mark right here which it turns out is actually the halfway point of the drag strip so shout out to engineering explain for doing the math on this one I'll leave the video below but it turns out the Carrera t thanks to its gearbox is still eventually faster than a cyber Tru "especially if it's Towing 3,000 pounds" but it's really an eighth mile race that
they're showcasing here and then they quote the quarter mile time at the end as if they ran a quarter mile race but as we've learned today quick fast people will point out that difference but I'll let it slide it's just a drag race it's fun it's not that huge of a deal but I will say if you can from stoplight to stoplight be just as quick as basically "any other car in a ,000 lb truck that's" incredible that's hilarious that's really fun but hopefully at least now you understand why I'm saying
performance is a bit overrated it's more of a onetick pony in a straight line now that one trick is very fun and very appealing to certain people there are people every day who pick the F-150 Raptor over the F-150 for stuff like this but you know then you get to a turn and it's a truck again but also one more thing I just want to highlight again in our best run we got 10. n95 seconds in the cybertruck is this the fastest is this the World Record for fastest cybertruck quarter mile I haven't seen
any faster so let me know if you do but shout out to mil as a driver mod I think we might have a world record here all right the 800 volt architecture and the 48 volt low voltage system both new to the cybertruck I'm going underrated if only for the fun fact that this this is technically the lightest fully electric pickup truck in the world World which is not the highest bar to clear but yes thanks to the Lesser wire weight it is lighter than the Helmer EV it's also lighter than the F-150 Lightning and it
is lighter than the dramatically smaller rivan r1t so that's an accomplishment I was also hoping it would charge like just as fast or faster than other Teslas but it seems right in line you know 250 kows at V3 superchargers for about the first third of the curve uh you know it looks like less as far as miles per hour that you're adding to the battery but that's in including driving efficiency which is thanks to the aerodynamics of a refrigerator not great now I also want
to give a shout out specifically to the suspension just the suspension on the cybertruck which I think is underrated first of all there's a huge amount of travel between the lowest and firmest and the highest and softest settings and no one's going to say this thing drives like a sports car but it is pretty impressively low and firm in its lowest setting and it's very high and it can move between those low and high settings really quickly and I was also very impressed by how how little roll and yaw
there was typically a big truck you hit accelerate and the nose comes up a lot this one goes up a little not bad but then also we got to talk about just for a second Tesla's minimalism because it's a kind of a staple of Teslas at this point especially with the cybertruck here with the design but also on the inside and with materials and the choices they make I think a lot of us would agree that a physical button in a lot of ways is better than a digital button I don't think that's a hot take
but one of the reasons Tesla's been so successful business-wise over the past couple years in such a competitive market is because they figured out a way to make a profit on every vehicle and they minimize all of the extra pieces all of the moving parts and they've gotten rid of a lot of buttons actually they've gotten rid of basically every button in the cybertruck but because of Tesla's success I feel like audio manufacturers have started to copy a lot of what Tesla does to the detriment of
some of their vehicles I would have liked to have seen in the Cyber truck this big special vehicle maybe a cool key fob that has access to a button to open the front trunk or maybe real climate control buttons or maybe we all know they should have done a mirror that's actually a screen so you could see out the back of the truck without looking down at the screen but they didn't do that so I'm saying Tesla's minimalism kind of overrated here but I also do need you to know that despite
all the other interesting technical stuff that I've talked about in this video this is still a Tesla under the hood and all of the things that we love about that and all the other stuff that comes with it that means it works with Tesla superchargers all over the country that also means it has a super heavy 123 KW battery in the floor it means that the quiet interior of the vehicle makes the speaker system sound way better than it probably should and it also means a bunch of things are missing about these
early trucks as they deliver them the super heavy additional range extender battery in the back isn't shipping yet and nobody knows when it will the screen also has no carplay or Android auto but the software is really good and super fast but there's also no autopilot right now even if you paid for it no light bar right now even if you paid for it no Arrow caps right now and you did pay for those the locking differential at the rear axle doesn't work in the dual motor version of this truck yet and there's
only one tire option for a truck all of these are decisions that Tesla makes knowing the priorities of the probable buyers the millions of pre-orders of the Cyber truck they know what people are probably going to do with these they know what people think they're going to do with these and they know what people want when they buy one of these things it's a Tesla under the hood so I was driving to the studa the other day and on my way there I'm coming up over this hill and on the other side of the hill
is this biker across the street and as I came over the hill he looked up and he saw the truck for about two seconds and then he reached out and he just did this as he as he biked past me but later that same night I was on my way home from practice around the the bridge somewhere in New York City at night and slowing down in traffic this car pulls up next to me kind of in front of me and all four of the windows roll down and these super happy faces all stick out and just like give me thumbs up and they're
grinning the entire time and i' say that's about the ratio of joy to Absolute disgust that you bring into the world driving the Cyber Tru around it's probably like 8020 so what's the verdict with the cybertruck right I think there's a lot going on between those four corners a lot of interesting choices and materials and Technologies and steer by wire and 800 volt systems and all this stuff but a lot of it frankly is overshadowed by the design again so we keep coming back to the
design and uh I feel like we can use that word again iconic I would say as a product person I do think this is already an iconic design now that comes with a lot of baggage I feel like when you say that word it's kind of like joining the rare air of like the the bedroom poster of some on some kids wall it's like the Lamborghini Kosh or the Bugatti veun or something like a Tesla cybertruck but the thing about those iconic cars is they're also almost always rare and that's the thing like if you
saw a Bugatti Veron on the street that's probably the only Bugatti Veron you're going to see on the street for a long time there's not that many Lamborghini koses out on the world now the cybertruck today is super rare and there's all these articles about you know celebrities driving them around and when you see one it's an event that's why people are reacting the way they are it's probably because it's the first time they're ever seeing one but the cybertruck is slotted to be
mass-produced so I feel like this actually has to wear off after a while like obviously it hits different seeing your 10th or 50th or 100th cyber truck of the day right so how how does that match up I think there's like 2 million plus pre-orders of the Cyber Tru and more coming there were only ever about "2,000 Lamborghini caches ever made there" was less than 500 Bugatti verons ever made so it's kind of hard to find a comp for a vehicle that starts off its life as iconic but then is mass-produced and
there was this really interesting comment on the autofocus video I made about this truck on owning the PT Cruiser when it first came out and I wasn't really old enough to remember this so I'm purely taking their word for it but apparently it was a crazy enough design that it got a lot of attention when it first started being made you know it's a weird shape had some odd material choices and all that but eventually Chrysler made over a million PT Cruisers but now we know exactly how
cool the PT Cruiser is you know it gets humanized more and more the more you see them on the road you see them get an accidents and have to maneuver through traffic and they're just regular people and regular cars and they're everywhere and I guess the question is is that the arc for the Tesla cybertruck like we don't know but it has to go from being this crazy unobtanium that it is right now to being something only time will tell thanks for  peace
