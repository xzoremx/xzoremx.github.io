so there's two types of people in this world either airpods fit in your ears or airpods don't fit in your ears there's two types of people in this world you either love silicon tip in earbuds or you hate silicon tip in your buds there's two types of people in this world people who really need noise cancellation and people who don't really care about it but Apple wants both people's money so there's two versions of the new airpods this year it was kind of confusing the way they announced it
at the keynote but essentially for 129 there's the base airpods 4 but then for 179 there is airpods 4 with noise cancellation but that is not the only difference between them so now that I've been testing them for a few days I can give you the verdict on them what the differences are and if they're actually worth it so first of all let's just start with the airpods themselves they've tweaked the shape of these buds again and so they've gotten some new curves and some new angles and the
driver points a little bit more directly into your ear with less Reflections the stem is also a little bit shorter but otherwise I mean yeah it still look like airpods they're very familiar they have ip54 dust and water resistance up from ipx4 last year and they still have the in-ear detection there's still microphones all the way around but my biggest question personally before anything else was actually just does this slightly new shape actually fit better in my ear because I have not had
any luck with hard tipped airpods ever really since they first came out the latest version was the closest like I could put them in my ears but if I jogged for more than about 10 seconds they would just slowly fall out so are the fours actually better for me uh slightly but not really I I put them in my ears I was trying to okay let's see if this is actually better I kind of twist them a little bit do the classic like you know get them seated in my ear but it's not for very long they
still slowly even when I'm just sitting around slowly feel like they're coming out of my ear so I think if you had problems with previous airpods you'll probably still have problems with these but if they fit in your ears then these will also fit in your ears now all of what I've said so far is true about both the base airpods and the active noise cancelling version they're the same size same shape and everything like you can't tell the difference from the outside of the buds where the differences start
though is this new case so let's look at the case the case is a little bit smaller it is USB type-c thank God but with the base version that's it it's just a case with USBC with the noise cancelling headphones the case also gets a small speaker at the bottom so it can chime when it's charging and they make a noise when they're lost and they have wireless charging on the back as well which is super convenient one thing I've noticed though it doesn't have mag safe anymore I think because this case is
literally just slightly too small now so the last generation of airpods the case with wireless charging would actually align and stick to the back of a MAG safe charger which is really convenient for just like dropping on the charger not thinking about it but this year's case you know slightly smaller I think it's just a little bit smaller than the magnetic ring so that's gone so it'll still charge on any chat charger but it does not stick to it for any sort of alignment which is kind of a bummer so
if you got one of those upright Chargers and you try to stick it to it it'll just slide off now um so USB type-c upside mag safe gone downside I also have noticed and maybe it's just because they're brand new but it feels like the magnets holding them into the case are just feels more secure I think that's a good thing and this case still works with Apple watch Puck Chargers by the way fun fact this isn't a normal chat charger at all it literally only charges Apple watches and airpods but hey they
still do magnetize so maybe that's worth something and then for the hidden feature that nobody's mentioned in any of the presentations or Keynotes or anything uh remember the back of airpods 3 there was a little pairing button so if you were manually pairing it to a phone or something like that you would hit this button that uh is gone from the new airpods 4 case so where did that go and it turns out now it's a hidden capacitive touch area kind of right underneath the pairing light on the
front so you can double tap here then it starts blinking and that initiates the pairing mode and actually a triple tap will allow you to start a factory reset of the buds so no longer a physical button kind of a hidden trick the more you know but the biggest question that I'm sure most people are actually wondering is how good is the active noise cancellation on these new air ODS should you actually choose to get it without going airpods pro with silicon tips is it actually good so my point of
reference is going to be airpods Pro to you know obviously there's lots of other earbuds that havec but just sound quality apples for apples wise that's probably the most direct comparison and I'll say while these are impressive they are definitely not as good as the pros they're just not and this is most definitely because of physics so since the hard tip doesn't AB absolutely perfectly fit inside my ear one: one it just means there's a little bit of air gaps around the outside of it just a
little there's a little bit of sound that can make it from the outside into my ear literally around the earbud so whether it's white noise or Street Sounds or voices the ANC clearly works and it does a good job of basically lowering the background noise so you can hear whatever you're listening to better but it's not quite gone so I feel like if airpods Pro are like an 8 out of 10 for noise cancellation just based on how much of the background noise it's removing these hard tipped airpods are
around like a four maybe four or five it's less noise cancellation and more noise reduction if that makes sense like still very useful uh but it's most useful in particularly loud environments like if you're on a train or on a plane or with like a lot of loud voices or Street Sounds around you that's when you'll most appreciate the reduction in noise because you can hear what you're actually trying to listen to better but if you're in a quiet room or a library or something like that it doesn't
actually make that much of a difference but then probably just as important as noise cancellation is every pair of headphones that has that should also have transparency mode and these do and this might be the best transparency mode I've ever heard on any airpods sounds Supernatural probably because literally some of the outside environment noise is already getting in and so what it boosts in through the microphones should sound just like it some other small tidbits about these uh battery life does
technically get slightly worse with andc on so it's rated for 4 hours still respectable um but a total of 20 hours with the case with noise cancellation uh these also now join airpods Pro with USBC as the only other headphones to have the ultra low latency support for Vision Pro so thanks H2 chip and then Precision finding is useful but that speaker does really help if they're kind of underneath something or inside a bag or you need to find it but don't really have a visual on it love having the
speaker on the case and then if you were paying really close attention in the last Apple keynote you might have caught that there was actually also an airpods Max refresh alongside these but I use the word refresh like very lightly just because all they really did was make it USB type-c and some new colors and that's it literally that's it they didn't do any other no mesh updates no case updates no onoff switch no material updates no driver updates no sound quality changes no new features no H2
chip just USBC that's absolutely ridiculous and I will not be reviewing those headphones but what I did see is some comments of people asking likeit wait what is the H2 chip even all about like does it matter that the new ones didn't get the H2 chip so let me just break down what that's for the H2 chip inside these airpods is basically doing all of the processing especially from these microphones so all of the improved background noise reduction for phone calls all of the active noise
cancellation transparency mode and adaptive audio and it also now lets you nod or shake your head to answer Siri questions so if there's like an incoming call and it announces a new call you can literally Nodge your head to answer it instead of talking out loud or if you get a text and Siri asks do you want to respond but you don't want to you literally just shake your head it actually works super well but then it's also just a matter of principle like there's no way your brand new flagship
$550 overear noise cancelling headphones shouldn't have all the latest and greatest Parts internally and externally but here we are but anyway the sound quality of these new airpods is perfectly solid some people were surprised at my opinion about this last time but the airpods 3 did take a pretty respectable step up and while there still is no EQ anywhere and there's not a whole lot of customization to the sound they do a good job of sort of being decent at every everything cuz
these have to do phone calls and podcasts which have a lot of vocal frequencies but they also have to do movies and they also have to do music and they're kind of just tuned to be solid at everything so overall 129 for the Bas airpods 179 for the airpods with active noise cancellation now you know all the differences now you know what they do and how good they are at it and you can choose which one you want for yourself me personally I'm still a silicon ear tips person just for my own Earp pods like
they fit in my ears so much better the seal is so much better it makes a noise cancellation dramatically better so I'm still leaning airpods Pro for myself matter of fact you can get airpods Pro on Amazon for like $1.99 right now so it's only 20 bucks more than these but I still think people will happily save the 20 bucks and get the hard tip ones they still get beat in individual categories by others in the wide world of other earbuds available out there like some will have a better fit in the ear which
will be better for working out and running and stuff some others will have better battery life and even some others will have better sound quality especially for music but these are still airpods which means they work best with the ecosystem with the seamless switching between all the Apple devices in your life and they still have that sort of generic useful frequency response across the range for everything that's what they're good at now if you're thinking of picking up a new pair
of airpods but you don't love the dental floss look well then Channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with their new Area 51 case and this isn't just some regular printed Design This topographical pattern has a crazy like 3D printed texture that you can actually feel I honestly I'm not sure how they did this but the 3D ink is it's super durable it adds this extra layer of grippiness that's hard to describe and this isn't just some random pattern apparently dbrand put an actual
topographical map of Area 51 on here because of course they would so there are three different colorways of it there's red yellow and black and I'm usually all in on matte black but this is a nice yellow looks pretty sick and these new Area 51 Skins are available for a ton of different devices so I'll leave a link below in the description if you want to pick one up for yourself but that's basically it thanks for watching and I'll catch you very soon in the next one peace
