all right so cmf phone one by nothing is kind of a confusing name but what this phone's trying to do not confusing at all love it or hate it this is one of the most interesting new phones in the world at the moment because nothing came along a few years ago and said hey what if we tried to make an average budget phone but with a focus on software and design and it kind of worked those phones are pretty good and so now cmf is the budget sub brand of nothing and they've come along and said hey well
what if we did the same thing but even more so that's how you end up with this this is a $200 Android phone that on paper doesn't really stand out specs wise in the sea of other $200 Android phones that can get but it absolutely does stand out with its software and design and I just want to start with the design first because that's the most interesting thing about this phone by a mile so this is the cmf phone in black and on the surface it's nothing too crazy right it's got flat sides pretty
average bezels all the way around this big AMOLED display and dual cameras up in the corner on the back but then you realize two things first there's a knob like a dial down here at the bottom corner corner of the phone and second there's also a bunch of these metal screws all the way around the outside and that's because this plastic back is completely removable and replaceable in a couple different colors there's black there's also orange there's a blue and there is a light blue which also kind of
has a little green Hue to it depending on who you ask so right off the bat this idea is pretty unique like for any phone especially at this price I remember back in the Moto Maker days a while ago you could sort of customize your phone but that was also much more permanent and it's been many years since we had removable backs on phones and even though nothing else comes off and the battery isn't removable and the back still feels super cheap and flexible because it is but once it's on the phone
it feels pretty rigid and sturdy and it's still cool to see the ability to change the color and it's it's a convenient little upsell for the company that's selling the phone itself for so cheap so then in the Box for the cover you also get this little orange combo Sim ejector tool and flathead screwdriver since you'll need this tool to remove the SIM card tray and all of the screws to get the back off and then it comes with a matching SIM card tray and dial to pop on the back so that
everything matches up but you can also totally mix and match if you want it kind of makes the phone maybe feel a little bit more like your own so the color changing back is one thing but then there's also this knob I keep pointing at down here in the corner and this is a separate feature so I remember when they first started started teasing this on Twitter we were trying to figure out like on the waveform podcast like what is this going to be is this a volume knob is this going to be just
like a fidget toy or is it a mappable thing with the software like what's the what's the knob uh and it turns out it's a mounting attaching point for some accessories so it's not like something that spins freely it's kind of just a fancy thumb screw with a colorful cap and if you take it off you can replace it with one of three accessories that they've made so far there is a kickstand which lets you prop up your phone on like a flat table or a surface there's also a card holder wallet which lets me
put up to four cards in the back and then slap it on the back with magnets and carry it around with me and there's a lanyard uh not sure how many people are going to put their phone on a lyard but you now at least have the option to you can securely attach it to the corner of the phone so is this a gimmick I'm going to vote no I I think that kickstand is the one thing that I would actually want to have on my phone or at least the option to have on my phone whenever I want it's kind of nice
that that's available for it but in general it's just the main point of it is it's one more useful thing to separate it from other phones at 200 bucks in the design Department I was going to say it feels kind of like an ultra budget version of Mag safe where instead of having magnets you literally have to screw the thing onto your phone but then I realized wait this magnet accessory which is the plate that you screw onto the back of your phone for the wallet connects with this
suspiciously familiar looking ring of magnets in the middle so Just for kicks I slapped a MAG safe mount on there and it's stuck like really well so I actually think if you want to buy uh like a car mount or some accessory to attach to this phone I actually think you could buy a MAG safe one this is the moment mag safe Puck and it will hold the phone from the back so the more you know now it obviously takes a bit of work several screws the SIM card ejector tool and the twisting and all that to
take these accessories off the back of the phone and put a new one on so this isn't something you'd probably do every day or multiple times per day or anything like that but it works you have the ability to and then when there's nothing on the back of the phone this dial actually kind of protrudes the exact same amount as the camera bump in the opposite corner so it prevents it from rocking back and forth at all well played cmf well played so they've got lots of neat little Hardware
customizations but the other important thing about a phone is what it's actually like to use so I've been using the cmf phone one for the better part of about a week now and to be honest it feels just like I'm using a nothing phone which is a compliment matter of fact it's literally running nothing OS 2.6 and aside from the light up glyph interface it's not missing a single feature that the more premium nothing phones actually have it's got the cloned apps feature where you can have more
than one instance of a single app installed uh it's got game mode it's got the clever little one-handed pull down gesture where you can pull down the notifications without reaching and of course all the Aesthetics you know the icon pack the home screen widgets the dots font all that fun stuff you still have that spot where you can view all of your notification history underrated feature you know just it behaves exactly like a nothing phone and using this phone I can honestly say that there were
stretches of time where I'd forget I was using an ultra cheap phone like it's it's a fairly bright responsive display it's typically 5 to 700 nits but it's an "AMOLED that Peaks at 2,000 nits and it's" adaptive between 60 and 120 HZ with a 240 HZ touch sample rate so it's decently smooth and quick so you know just flipping around through the daily inconsequential stuff like scrolling through social media or or reading emails or light web browsing for that stuff of course this phone is totally
fine super smooth the chip powering everything here is the mediatech dimensity 7300 5G it's about on par with the Snapdragon 7 gen 1 as far as benchmarks and they pair it with either 6 or 8 gigs of RAM depending on what spec you get it's really decently well equipped for 200 bucks but you can definitely get this phone to show its price though like it's not perfect these aren't complaints these are just facts about the tradeoffs you obviously have to make to get a phone to be this cheap
"so like this phone has a 5,000 mAh" battery and a really solid battery life but there's no wireless charging and of course there's no charger included in the box if you're wondering though it supports up to 33 WS but then this phone also has no NFC it has a really crappy cheap vibration motor it has a single mono speaker down here at the bottom that's surprisingly easy to just block with one finger the IAL unders screen fingerprint sensor I actually think that's pretty impressive for this price
range but it's also been noticeably on the slower side for me and sometimes asked for multiple reads before unlocking and then these plastic backs you know like I said they feel fine when they're attached to the frame of the phone but like a car bumper when they're not attached to the frame you can really feel how flimsy they are these are plastic the buttons in here are they feel like they're literally held on by elastic that I feel like I could snap at any moment I mean they haven't yet but
they just look like they could and of course with removable backs the whole phone can't be super water resistant so it's just ip52 rated basically just good for a splash and we all know budget phone cameras have never been anything special this phone is rocking a Sony sensor it's a 50 megapixel primary sensor for the camera and it takes I would say serviceable photos they're not terrible I would say you know it's an IMX 882 so it's actually the same sensor that's in the Poco F6 and the real 12
Pro and some other pretty budget phones and also the Moto Edge for some reason but anyway there's also no ois so when the light starts going away it gets rough pretty quick and then that second sensor up at the top uh well that's not a camera at all that actually it almost never really does anything turns out it's just a depth sensor for specifically shooting 2x portrait mode photos to get a bit of a cleaner more accurate bokeh cutout but it didn't o complain much at all when I took photos
with it covered or anytime while shooting actually so hey budget phones make sacrifices that's not a New Concept here but I like the set of tradeoffs that they made with this one I mean squinting back at it it doesn't look bad for a $200 phone and I think the set of trade-offs that they made in the name of really good design and software I like it now this phone is mainly targeted towards India that's the market that it's supposed to be most competitive in and in that market yeah
there's other cheap phones they're a little more expensive than this but they will also have like the two years of software updates and three years of security updates they will also have you know big screens and relatively thin bezels and mediatech chips they're usually not ameds though so that's good about this one and a lot of them will also have Micro SD card expansion which this phone also has probably the only notable missing thing is NFC but but just the sheer amount of time I was able
to enjoy using this phone and not thinking about its price because of how smooth it is all the software features it has that's pretty sick it's the $200 phone engineered to look cool basically and cmf has also just introduced a bunch of other stuff as well there's a new smartwatch $69 nice also a new set of earbuds $59 so to give you an idea of what they're working on but let me know what you think that's my review of the cmf phone one thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
