a widescreen iPod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communication  device profound new intelligence capabilities that will make our platforms even smarter so this is the iPhone 16 and this is the iPhone 16 Pro brand new and I've been testing them for about 2 weeks now but you know what I've been doing way longer than 2 weeks weeks working on a new app that we are finally launching you guys have always been asking me where I get my wallpapers like it's
frequently the number one suggested search result under my name has been for years so now we've put them all in one place it's called panels and it's finally live in the App Store both on iOS and on Android feels really good to be able to say that so if you're wondering where the wallpaper on these phones and the review came from panels if you're wondering where the wallpaper in the last video came from panels matter of fact almost all the wallpapers all the devices and in backgrounds
you've seen in my videos for the past year have all come from panels which is pretty sick we have a bunch of awesome artists over there that we are splitting profits with 50/50 and there's already a ton of great collections of Art and much more incoming and we have some pretty big plans for this thing so it's starting off as a wallpaper app now I don't want to overpromise too much but it's going to be pretty consistently improving over time which is part of the reason why we're offering a subscription
to support it so go pick it up now poke around find your new favorite wallpaper your new favorite artist and let me know what you think it's kind of fun to be on the other side now on the development side where now other people are going to review what we make which is always exciting anyway so the meta with new smartphones these days is a bunch of incremental Hardware improvements and then a whole bunch of AI features that also are being added on top which is where the real value is and while
they're a little late to the game Apple has hit that chapter 2 with the iPhone whether we like it or not so the iPhone 16 is a minor minor update over the 15 but with a ton of new AI stuff labeled Apple intelligence except that stuff's not here yet which is a little awkward considering basically all of the marketing for this phone is Apple intelligence stuff like I've seen Billboards touting that as the new thing here their whole event was about how it's glow time which is a reference to
the new glowing Siri animation but none of that stuff is on this phone none of it so the only way to square the state of this phone right now with everything Apple has said about this phone is that it's unfinished like this is the most unfinished I've ever seen a new iPhone launch so until we actually have all that Apple intelligence stuff we are left with a  so there's not a lot actually physically new with this year's iPhone but it's not nothing so the iPhone 16 looks a little
different from the iPhone 15 there was a moment in time not that long ago where Apple removed the headphone jack and then there was a ton of speculation about them maybe removing all the ports and all the buttons but instead it's gone the opposite way and they've added the action button from last year's pros and yet another button called camera control which we'll get to in a second aesthetically though there are some really poppy new colors and slightly larer protruding cameras lined up on the
back of the phone and okay I know everyone puts a case on their phone so this is probably nothing but I think this is the wobbly slab phone I have ever seen or at least that I can remember but either way the rest of the general shape and flat sides and dimensions of this phone are basically the same very familiar iPhone the pro phones are even harder to tell apart but they do have new displays and they are great so they're slightly bigger 6.3 and 6.9 in respectively and the bezels are I think actually
noticeably thinner and still even all the way around so both sized phones are just a little larger than last year and fit bigger batteries too and we should talk about batteries so when Apple unveiled all these new phones they made kind of a big deal about how they all have slightly larger capacity batteries across the board and that the new Pro Max would have the longest battery life ever in an iPhone which I mean I would hope that your newest most expensive most high-tech big biggest phone ever is
the longest battery but still they didn't give any numbers to support that so we don't actually know how much larger and milliamp hours the battery is or how much longer the battery actually lasts all I have to go on is Apple's websites comparison tool which only measures in video playback hours so it has the iPhone 16 at 22 hours of video playback up from 20 and the 16 Pro Max is all the way up to 33 hours versus last year's big phones 29 unfortunately this means almost nothing to me because
that video playback can be optimized with like cores on a chip who cares but now the phones are out and people have gotten them and torn them apart measured them turns out the batteries are about 6% larger across the board and 9% larger on the pro and I found battery life about the same as last year to be honest like not noticeably better not noticeably worse I end up saying a lot of the same things about it like it lasts me a whole day on the pro heavy use no problem what actually did make a difference to
me though is faster charging less people are talking about it but all of the new iPhone 16 lineup supports up to 45 watt wired charging now Apple never talks about fast charging they never brag about like how fast you can go 0 to 100 or 0 to 80% but when their phones do get slightly faster at charging it's pretty nice it's too bad it doesn't come with the fast charging Brick In The Box but I have a fast charger I am loving the new fast charging and bursts and also mag
safe supports with the new Puck up to 25 W wireless charging instead of 15 on the inside these phones have the a18 and a18 pro chips and again I'd be lying if I told you I just noticed any difference right out the box and I think basically anybody would but yes they will Benchmark 10 20 30% faster depending on what you ask it to do but the extra power is definitely more about Fringe activities high-end stuff future proofing I was actually more curious though to find that all of the models
have 8 gigs of RAM now so the pro phone and the non-pr phones which usually have different amounts no doubt this is because the Apple intelligence features when they eventually ship are going to need every last bit of it but for now hey you can enjoy more RAM for all your other apps too iOS 18 launched with these new phones too so I made an entire separate video about iOS 18 all the new features that's what's rolling out to everybody's older iPhones as well now too so you can put your home screen
icons wherever you can color your home screen icons you can change your lock screen shortcuts basically customize the iPhone a bit more than ever before you could argue this makes a bigger difference to the iPhone than any of the other Hardware stuff but yeah I'll I'll link that full video below but speaking  button so I guess nobody at Apple is allowed to call it a button but I'm going to call it a button so this is the new camera control button on all of the new iPhone Ione 16s I've used and played
with and thought a lot about this button and actually it all comes down to smartphone cameras in general my take is that smartphone cameras are like headphones EQ like you get a new pair of headphones out the box and you listen to them you don't like them oh no no don't worry that's just one of the ways that these headphones can sound you can change the EQ and it'll sound like a totally different pair of headphones and that's also true with smartphone cameras this year more than ever with the iPhone
so the default photos from the iPhone look more iphony than ever remember how every year in the blind smartphone camera test the iPhone loses because it kind of overly brightens all the shadows and it doesn't have as much contrast yeah it's still doing that especially in photos with people in it but the purpose of this new button has been made very clear and it's kind of a theme for the whole phone which is well camera control this year Apple's kind of just giving back control of the camera to users in
an interesting way but you have to know how to use it like you have to know that it's a double half press with just the right weight to bring up the sliding menu of camera controls for things like exposure compensation and zoom and photographic Styles and tone and then play with it enough to realize that tone is actually maybe the most important one where turning up tone actually removes Shadows even more but turning down tone brings real Shadows back but it doesn't seem to have a memory so you have to
remember to set it every time you open the the camera app but you also have this d-pad that lets you change even more elements of a photo including undertones and mood and color and really mess around and dial in the look of the photos you want and this one does have memory so every subsequent time you open the camera it'll remember your color Hue and tone so I found that tone at around minus5 is a nice balance for most photos that I've been taking feels less flat more contrasty this is all really useful
to me and combined with the actual new cameras on the phones this has risen the iPhone back to the top of my personal favorite rankings of smartphones to shoot with I just like having more control over the camera camera control but it is really finicky like the placement on the side of the phone for the button is mostly ideal for landscape but would definitely be easier to reach if it was closer to the corner but for being honest most people take photos and videos in portrait these days and the
corner would be horrible for portrait so they split the difference and moved it up a bit so you could reach it but it's still not great and the half press sensitivity takes some time to really get used to I'm on week three now and I'm still accidentally taking pictures by tapping too hard and the scrolling it has momentum physics and you can accidentally scroll too far and go past the thing you were targeting in this more continuous scrolling interface it is just finicky enough and just hidden
enough that I I honestly think like 99% of people will never use this for anything other than just a camera shutter button and I guess that's fine too I personally did quickly get used to opening the camera quickly with the camera control button and so I remapped my action button to something else my tasks app and I've also remapped my lock screen shortcut so it's now flashlight and my tasks app again and you can always just swipe over sideways from the lock screen and get to the stock camera
app so if you really want you can map the camera control button to open any other camera app on your phone or just keep waiting for app intelligence features that this will probably make more sense for so yeah long story short one it's a button two it's also a customization slider three is just going to be a button for most people but also four there are new cameras on the back so there's a bunch of new cameras across the line for both iPhone 16 and 16 Pro best way to summarize it okay so
iPhone 16 cameras are nice like they're pretty solid main cameras very much in character with iPhones of the past but not noticeably better than previous years and then the 16 Pro cameras with the much bigger main sensor and the higher resolution Ultra wide and the 5x telephoto are a significant step up in my opinion the main camera I think is my favorite primary sensor in any smartphone to shoot with right now it's really good at basically everything the ultrawide is also better but kind of
only in detail during the daytime since it's the 48 megapixel sensor now but the sensor is not bigger enough to matter at night though and now my night Ultra wides all look kind of vignetted for some reason I mean look at that it looks like I added a filter but then the 5x telephoto on both the pros is also nice now and there is some chatter about it being worse at the 3x to 4X range because you're still having to do digital zoom and technically that's true but I find the 5x to be a pretty useful
zoom and it's also better at resolving all the detail past 5x than before even without AI shutter speeds are super fast and freeze action better than ever before this is kind of underrated but I love this like this shot came from a moving car at highway speed and so did this one so that's sick and the ease at which you can get a shallow depth of field with a close-up subject is on par with any other big sensor Android Flagship like s24 Ultra or pixel9 Pro and no apple has absolutely not fixed
the lens flare issue with Point lights at night so for those who are wondering sorry but aside from that video is very impressive I'll be publishing the next autofocus video on the Silverado EV pickup truck pretty soon so subscribe over there for that first of all but that's going to be shot entirely on iPhone 16 Pro and I've been very happy with it and apple also added a 4K 120 FPS mode to the pro phones and it's sick it looks great it is really convenient to shoot and edit
the only thing you got to be careful with is storage cuz it can really eat up storage like you can get up to near a gig a minute and that's before you even do 4K 120 Pro res or prores log but yeah I still love shooting it anyway it also proves to me that they have the processing power and the sensor readout speed to do 8K 30 they just choose not to and I wonder why sometimes this also the first year they're using the term Fusion camera and you kind of have to dig in a little bit to try to figure out
what that means turns out it's basically the same thing as last year's like punch in Optical quality Zoom but with a slightly updated image processing pipeline cool but also that Zoom is not technically one: one Optical quality because the photo sites are smaller in that smaller crop nevertheless iPhone 16 camera good iPhone 16 Pro Camera great  there is something truly weird about this product being launched at an Apple event called glow time and not launching with the thing that glows the new Siri
there's something weird about people happily going out to a Fifth Avenue Apple Store this week which is literally glowing with rainbows now and walking out with a brand new phone that doesn't have that like there's something just off about Billboards and marketing material and all highlighting Apple intelligence and Tim Cook saying this was the first phone built from the ground up for Apple intelligence the next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple intelligence from the
ground up yet this phone does not have apple intelligence at all it's all coming soon and coming later this year and into next year eventually with software updates but if I've said it once I've said it a million times never buy a product based on the promise of future software updates buy it for what it is right now when you buy it that's been the golden rule for forever but yet here we are times have changed this has been a common Trend alongside Ai and you think Apple might be immune to it but they're
not they're a public company and just like lots of other public companies they've sort of caved to this pressure that they have to appear like an AI first AI forward company like a leader in AI so they have presented a ton of AI stuff that they working on and they've done the song and dance of like hey we are AI first and the phone's built from the ground up for AI it's our whole theme this year but the fact of the matter is it's not good yet it's not it's that's actually not even finished
if it was they'd be shipping it but it's in beta and they're still working on it and they'd rather keep working on it than ship it to you now so how do we Square this do we even Square this you remember the rabbit R1 the rabbit was a little AI in a box pretty classic 2024 product when I reviewed that rabbit it was basically useless like literally almost none of the functionality was working as it shipped and so I said so in the review same with the Humane AI pin really really really
bad product missing almost all of its functionality worst product I'd ever reviewed for now both of those products have started to get some updates since I reviewed them but again I can only review what's in front of me like I got that thing in the mail just like real customers are going to get that thing in the mail and now it feels like the new iPhone is suddenly in the same boat so I guess the difference between the rabbit and the Humane pin and the iPhone is well one the iPhone is a fine Standalone
product even without the promised stuff and it's buyable and usable where the other two not so much but two is that Apple at least now has some element of a track record of developing and shipping things that they promised where Humane and rabbit didn't so you could argue there's some dimension of trust to this and that apple is really leaning heavily on how much you trust them because to be honest to me it's really bold to be shipping the product like this without any of
these big things that you're promising like they must really believe in themselves to eventually ship this stuff so that people aren't mad but yeah there's that's the AI world we live in I guess is that everyone has this pressure to feel like a leader in Ai and be shipping all these new features and stuff but a lot of it not that good yet not that done yet so I'm planning an entire separate review of Apple intelligence as a whole when it comes out I've been using some of the
features in 18.1 beta on my 15 Pro but even this is really limited like it's basically just writing tools and the new Siri animation but they have a long way to go I'll say get subscribed to see the Apple intelligence review when it drops when it's done because clearly it's a big part of this  phone so you made it this far into the video or you skipped ahead to this chapter because you just really wanted an answer on if you should buy these phones or not fine either way so okay
you should buy the iPhone 16 if you're on an iPhone 13 or older and you know that phone is on its last legs and you're really looking for an upgrade to a new iPhone fine anything newer and it probably won't feel like it's worth an upgrade and you should buy the iPhone 16 Pro if you really want a better phone in cameras or displays that's really the two places where the pro shines over the regular phone the cheap iPhone really has never looked better honestly it has the camera control it matches the ram of
the more expensive Pros it has the more interesting colors if you're into that it has the action button now too and it has the same brightness of a display and it also goes all the way down to one knit just like the pro screen now I personally cannot use a 60 HZ $800 phone in 2024 I just can't do it and there are lots of people just like me who will immediately have to upgrade to the pro just for that but there are also tons of people who don't even notice or care about promotion which I know it's it's
kind of hard to WRA my head around too but for those people yeah this phone is the base phone is going to be great but then it's someone who shoots a lot of photos and videos and you know Social Media stuff the autofocus Channel between all that the cameras are better enough on the pros for that to be worth the upgrade for me but yeah I still say buy it for what it is today not for what it could be tomorrow and even without any of the AI stuff maybe ever coming to these phones they're still Rock Solid
very very incremental upgrades thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
