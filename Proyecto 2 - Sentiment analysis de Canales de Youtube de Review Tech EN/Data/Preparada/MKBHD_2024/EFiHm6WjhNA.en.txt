headphones headphones are a way for you to hear some audio and then no one else can so you put them on Boom mission accomplished I can hear the audio but you can't open back headphones are specific type of headphones that let the air go through them which allow you to also hear the environment of the room you're in so this is what a normal pair of open back headphones looks like just so you have some context this is my daily driver pair of cizer hd650 these I wear these at my desk I use them to edit
and so if someone in the studio wants to get my attention they don't have to tap me on the shoulder they can just say something and I can still hear them so this is what they normally look like but over the past couple weeks I started getting some emails with some very different looking open back headphones which to me is exciting because I wanted to check them out but also kind of weird because they're not that common of a type of headphone why am I getting all these emails all of a sudden but I just
started saying yes to all of them and they all started showing up and they're just as weird as I thought they would be so first up is these These are the Sony link buds open the link buds actually have been around for a little while but this is the newest generation and they're called the link buds open for a reason they are open back earbuds and they basically accomplish the same thing by having this little ring this little circle the wing tip helps it fit into the rest of your ear and so it just kind
of goes in your ear like this and you can probably already tell it's it's a little bit inset into the ear but the ring with a hole in the middle lets the sound get through but it still plays sound and it's it's kind of trippy these were basically the first non-traditional open back thing to show up in my inbox they've existed since like 2022 I've had link buds for a while now essentially the rest of them works the same way as normal earbuds there's still an app there's still controls on the bulb so
you can double tap the bulb to play pause uh USB type-c on this little sandwich looking case thing here and honestly the the circle sit so far into your ear when you put them in that I think you wouldn't even notice that if I walked by that I'm wearing open back earbuds even though I can totally hear everything as if I'm not wearing headphones so I think that's probably an upside that they don't look that weird you only have to use these earbuds for a short amount of time before you get
really good at just putting them in your ears just like normal earbuds you get totally used to the way they feel in the ear and honestly out the box they sound decent the thing about these open back headphones is they're never going to create the same feel in your ear as closed back so they will never have the same Basse response especially but you know Sony's app has this really interesting feature where you can blind test yourself through a bunch of different eqs to pick and I naturally
picked one with a bit more base to compensate so they sound closer to regular headphones overall really the only downside for me is long listening Comfort I'm just like not comfortable wearing them for a couple hours so I'm giving these a three out of five for sound and a four out of five for how transp apparent they are so then next up you have these these are a lot less normal looking these are the Bose Ultra open and that's what they look like now they look like they're in a normal
earbuds case but then you take the bud out and right off the bat uh it's different looking I don't know if it looks like a lapel mic or what exactly it looks like it definitely doesn't look like earbuds but the point here is this section is flexible and if you're wondering why it's because when you put it on your ear the back part goes behind your ear and the front part goes in it like that and that's how you wear it so if you have like a piercing or an earring up there you can't wear these
like the way they're supposed to but now the earbud part is technically in my ear and then the back section that would be the button the battery the microphones and the rest and so yeah it looks it looks a little different it looks like you're wearing um a not so traditional thing on your head and I don't know it's kind of not that weird actually from that point on though they really get treated like normal earbuds they also have an app you can change EQ stuff they have immersive audio support where you
can move your head around and hear the different instruments kind of stay fixed in place spatial audio if you want to call it that and they do feel very unobtrusive like I I really after just a few minutes kind of I can actually forget I'm wearing them they're not like squeezing very hard they're not very heavy I bet if I did a run or shook my head around a lot they would fall out but it would take a lot they're actually pretty secure so this one I ended up liking a lot for two reasons one it's
the most comfortable to wear for long periods of time and just forget that they're in your ears which is awesome and they sound just as good as the link buds with a little EQ adjustment but two these are the pair that I think people looking at you might actually understand the easiest that when they talk to you you can still hear them which is worth something uh downside though they do lack multipoint Bluetooth for the price which is crazy but yeah I find myself really enjoying how comfortable these
are as far as open back earbuds go and the angle that they are at the back of the ear means they don't really block as much from The Real World getting in so again almost no seal they can't compete with the sound of normal earbuds but I'm going to give these also a three for sound but a five for transparency because you can hear everything also Pro tip the battery lasts way longer if you turn immersive sound off so then we have the nothing ear open and these have a bigger case than the others but they
still get treated like earbuds you might have seen these cuz nothing does all kinds of marketing and they're kind of everywhere but you got the transparency look you've got the the right side is the the Red Dot which is a nice touch but uh these are again different and there are a bunch of other earbuds just like it but this is the kind that gets curled behind your ear so here's how it works you curl this back section behind and then it goes over the top and sort of floats in your ear like that so
there's a definitely an ear an air gap between my ear and the bud which is floating uh and it also looks different I would say I mean this is not going to trick anybody in thinking it's a normal earbud especially because they're white so they're they're contrasty on my skin but that's what the nothing ear open looks like and this one I just I feel like I don't like it as much it doesn't feel as secure in my ear I don't know if that's because there's so much play in in how much it can move around or if
it's just that doesn't fit my ear shape particularly well but it feels the most likely to fall out by far and of course yep there you go you still have on bud controls though you can actually squeeze this stem here and there play a little click sound and that controls the media and answers phone calls and everything it gets treated the same way as normal earbuds uh there's also an app where you can control EQ and mess with sound and compensate and add base and sort of mess with the way it actually
sounds but there's always going to be that air gap and that's always there's always going to be this sort of dangling feeling I've never worn uh earrings before but it kind of feels with the dangling kind of like I imagine earrings feel like I don't know these get the specs right uh they just happen to be in this form factor that's pretty common that I just don't like as much with the whole hook behind the ear thing this is though a bigger driver covering more of the opening to the ear
so you actually do get a bit more bass and a closer sound to normal earbuds I will say too nothing's X app has the most advanced equalizer of any of the ones that I've tried tons of detail you can get into with specific frequency response ranges and everything the downside though has turned out to be these have a lot of bleed like even more than usual in the open back segment and they also just they feel like they're always going to fall off my ears I don't know if it's just me but it just feels
like they're never quite secure and they also may be the most dorky looking kind of depends on who you are but the the transparency Motif is cool for open bag headon phones but also the white colors and accents are a bit much so I'm going to reward the sound Department with a four out of five and transparency is also a four good price tag too so next up is the nwm open back headphones and these now they're not earbuds anymore they're really headphones and maybe the most
open back that you could possibly have so you put them on and they look a little something like this the band goes over the top like normal and then the driver in the middle sits floating but obviously is not sealed at all with your ear and I can just hear everything else in the room like normal it kind of sounds like a there's a speaker floating next to my head which I think is actually a success and actually personally I'm a I'm a big fan of this design so the cushion here is is pretty
small it doesn't have this huge ear cushion because again it's trying to be thin they're not trying to create this seal with your ear it doesn't have to be some amazing cushion but it's pretty soft and then when you put put it on your ear it's super lightweight like this is the lightest pair of head I mean they look lightweight but this is the lightest pair of headphones I think I've ever worn and so because of that you can also kind of start to forget you're wearing them but they are wireless and
then they have this interesting feature and I've been trying to figure out why they did this and it's still not super clear to me but they can pivot like that and that sort of tilts the driver backwards when you're listening to music or when you have a phone call going and you tilt the drivers it tilts them away from your ear and so it becomes really muffled and I don't hear it very well anymore but if that's supposed to be some sort of like conversational feature where I I'm I'm
talking to someone so I'll just turn them like this I don't think the person I'm talking to is going to know what's happening all that being said I think this is my favorite set of weird open back headphones super light super open uh there's still controls on the left side and a volume rocker it supports multiplay and Bluetooth it has a 20h hour battery life on a single charge and the bonus is you can also still wear these with behind the ear hearing aids underneath them fun fact I did also play
with the the pivoting thing a little bit more turns out you can kind of put the headphones right over the middle of your ears and point them straight in or kind of move them forward a bit and then pivot them back into your ears so both work and you can play with the height too to kind of get them just right so that's probably the point of the pivot so what's not to like well they do they just feel kind of cheaply built for the price you're paying and and this is also the case that it comes with here it's
just packaging there really is no carrying case so that could be a worry for people trying to travel with these things but overall they're well done and they're getting my highest rating yet this is a four for sound and a five for transparency so then last but not least there's these which are not officially out yet but I did get an email from I believe the founder who sent these out these are the move engine m600 and and they are also open back headphones but you can see that they
look a little bit different because of the hole through the middle of them they serve the exact same purpose in the exact same way when I put them over my ears they are also pretty lightweight and they look actually from most angles kind of like normal headphones until you see them from the side and then you may notice that you can you can see the ear of the person wearing them but they're pretty comfortable they're also still lighter than normal headphones and I imagine they're trying to make them look
like this so that they're not as uh unusual as the other sort of non-traditional ones so I felt like initially these might have had the most potential to have the best combination of sound quality and transparency CU When you look inside here like you have all these all this room for these these big drivers and all the sound can come in here but the issue is basically that your ear is in the middle and you want the sound to come through the middle and it doesn't which is why these end up
sounding better which is crazy but it's because they point the audio directly into your ear so these they have this interesting look and it's so cool because yes it works I can hear the outside world when I put them on but it's also now a little bit more muffled because there's still this cavity around my ear and it actually suffered for that so as much as these look like they'd be better and more like real headphones these were better at almost everything I wanted to give these the benefit of the
doubt so bad just from being you know brand new almost not really even a product yet there is no app there is no EQ adjustment the sound quality is really bad and they're just kind of built like a 3D printed prototype but hey the upside is they are a proof of concept a proof that the ring design with the hole in the middle is actually worse than the driver in the Middle with the air all around it sound quality two transparency two now I got to end with this look these are are fun openback
headphones are fun but modern-day headphones have sort of tackled this Niche directly because you can put in today's modern earbuds or headphones and then the microphones on the outside will pass through the sound of the outside world straight through into your ears it'll sound like you're not even wearing headphones at all because of transparency mode and then they build features on top of that like automatically attenuating super loud damaging noises or even being able to to
turn your earbuds into hearing aids like apple just did with the airpods Pro 2 and then you can just hit a single button and turn them into noise cancelling headphones also which none of these could ever do so that makes the modern headphone much more versatile it's literally two pairs of headphones in one but I will say the thing about transparency mode is not all transparency modes are created equal so if you really wanted to argue for these you could say you know airpods have
really good transparency mode and I've heard some others get close to as good but some others which this requires compute some others aren't as accurate some others are a little bit muffled they have a tiny bit of a delay they don't sound as good as like a normal pair of transparent headphones so you could argue that if you want the best transparency mode possible then you'd want something like this because nothing beats actually hearing the real world around you so if transparency mode is
virtual reality headset then open back headphones are AR glasses think about it it makes sense thanks for watching check out another headphone video right here and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace
