all right I want to know what the most accurate wearable is for counting steps so last time I did this Thousand Steps thing I had a bunch of different SmartWatches on and this was the most accurate one it was the pixel watch but I want to know about the whoop which has step counting in beta now or potentially the Galaxy Ring smart ring or maybe it's a phone in a pocket I've got an Android phone in one pocket and an iPhone in the other pocket and I've got a pedometer here counting real steps also an Apple
Watch for good measure everything is counting my actual steps let's see which   "1,000 let's count all right so we've got" all final numbers and subtracted the starting numbers for each to get exactly how many steps accounted for my thousand so I guess don't buy a $5 pedometer on Amazon if you really want to an accurate step count buy a smart ring
