all right so there is just one thing that's starting to feel a little bit weird with this new pixel but I'll get to that by the end of this video let's just start with the obvious stuff what's actually new here so I just got some Hands-On time with Google's new budget phone the pixel 8A and I can confirm they are mostly sticking to the script here keeping it simple last year's phone was already really good making a few key improvements where it counts and keeping the price the same $500 500 bucks isn't
cheap but it's also not a flagship it's definitely in this nice little mid-range territory and I feel like that pixel has been slowly catching up their Hardware to the rest of the competition in this price point so at first glance it is well pretty unmistakably a pixel with the camera bar up top but there's a little change there's a little bit more rounded edges I really hope I'm not the only one getting round SpongeBob vibes from these corners but that's definitely what I see but that's the main design
change back here and then also around the back it's still got wireless charging it still has the same main camera sensor as the 7A with an ultra wide next to it but now there's new colors and this new matte texture so there's a black and a white that are called obsidian and Porcelain which look pretty tame but then there's also a new green and blue called aloe and Bay and they are definitely more vibrant the rails and the camera bar are all aluminum still it's still IP67 rated and
then there's a slightly larger battery but I mean it's we're talking very slight here I think it goes from 4385 milliamp hours to just over 40 400 but it still has wireless charging too then on the inside it's been bumped up to the new tensor G3 chip from last year's flagships so we know it's decently capable if a little inefficient but then it'll also start at 128 gigs of storage but for the first time they're also going to offer a 256 gig version of the aone as well and then around the front
an improved display so it's the same size still 6.1 in still has the middle hole punch cut out for the selfie camera still has an optical fingerprint reader but it's now an actua display so the peak brightness is 40% higher than before and I think it's noticeable this is one of those things that makes a big difference to everyday life and usability just being able to see it outdoors and it's now a ped that gets up to 120 HZ instead of the 90 HZ like last year now before you even type it I know
a lot of people are going to argue immediately this is not something that makes much of a difference to most pixel buyers and you're right in fact many of them will not notice this Improvement just because smooth display is actually off Again by default so it's a 60 HZ phone out the box and then you have to know to go into the settings and turn it on knowing it'll impact battery life and then even once you do it's not like locked at 120 HZ it's Dynamic up to 120 HZ so I played around with this phone
for a little bit it did feel very smooth to me it feels nice at 120 HZ so I'm personally happy about that change but I won't dwell on about it for too much longer so from there you already know what a pixel is right this is the mid-range SL budget version of the phone with great software like this is the one with the really smart AI features like call assist and pixel VPN and Magic Eraser audio and all kinds of other classic Google features it's the one with easily the best speech to text
transcription speed and accuracy I've ever used on a phone it's reliable enough to just write whatever you want emails texts notes whole paragraphs as fast as you want it's also the one that's promised 7even years of updates OS updates security updates feature drop updates and it's the one with really good cameras mostly basically unchanged from last year but all the pixel 7A did was literally get the highest ELO rating on our recent blind smartphone camera test with millions of votes up against
other top tier Flagship phones so I'd say that's a pretty good Baseline so it seems like a pretty safe bet pretty easy bet if you're a Google or pixel fan but I'll just say here are my worries with this pixel so first of all this is the first a series device that they're going to enable Gemini Nano on and Nano is the one that can go locally on the device entirely which is great they're probably going to make a big deal about it at the event and talk about it more at Google
IO and all this stuff but there's also now like this weird inconsistency with different assistants on the pixel phone it's not even just this phone but now you've got the Gemini app like showing off prominently on the home screen on these pixel 8 a which is the latest available and most capable voice and multimodal AI search that they have but then the Google search page right next to the home screen if you tap the mic there that's going to a totally separate but also very capable Google Voice
search with Google Assistant Google is literally now developing two different assistance side by side with overlapping but not fully congruent capabilities is just a little weird a little inconsistent and we saw it coming and we knew this would happen but I think they'll eventually have to consolidate them all into one I think Gemini will do everything at some point but then hey I guess the other thing to keep in mind is the price so again it's this phone's launch for $500 US mid-range phone
mid-range price everything seems reasonable here but let me remind you you can still buy last year's phone of the Year brand new pixel 8 for 550 bucks so this 8A right now is not that much cheaper than the 8 and if you do go with the eight while it is a couple months old now sure you're also getting a phone with thinner bezels and a brighter higher quality display arguably even better cameras with bigger sensors a bigger battery faster charging ip68 and it's the same tensor G3 like is that not
a way better feeling deal I mean if you can find one used that's even better pixel 8 was just such a good phone for that price that it makes phones both more and less expensive feel like worse buys like I talked about how pixel 8 Pro feels like such a hard sell cuz it's $250 more but now it also kind of makes the pixel 8A look a little too high priced so either way I'm sure pixel 9 and 9 Pro when they come out will shake things up but uh as of right now pixel 8A is just it's a solid mid-ranger solid
it's got all the stuff you kind of already know you're getting from a pixel and if you also plan on picking one of these up then Channel sponsor dbrand also has you covered with their hydro dip skins now I've been using dbrand skins literally since 2013 so that's over a decade now uh and the biggest thing for me is they basically add no thickness obviously to the device like a case wood but they can still totally change the look and feel now Beyond just the pixel skin and case dbrand also
supports with the hydro dip skin almost 200 devices so there's phones but also laptops tablets consoles you name it and there's four colorways of this one so Gold Rush solar flare toxic waste and cotton candy I'm thinking Gold Rush is the best looking one out of the bunch like I'm into the black white and gold combo super clean but honestly they all look pretty unique so if you have a favorite I'll leave a link down below so you can grab one for yourself but yeah that's basically it let me know what you
think of pixel 8A versus pixel 8 in this weird 6mon release stage thing Google's doing I'll check the comments either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
