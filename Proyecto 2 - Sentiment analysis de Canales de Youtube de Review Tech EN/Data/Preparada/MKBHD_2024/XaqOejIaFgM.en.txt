"all right you have $1,300 to spend on an" Android slab phone in 2024 why would you get any other phone no seriously why would you get any other phone this s24 Ultra has taken the best things from every other Ultra highend phone and stuff them into one place so anything that you could possibly value it has pushed to the Max and there's just multiple cherries on top just sprinkled all over the place   so the formula for Samsung's Ultra phones has evolved a little bit over the
years at first it was just the most numbers the biggest megapixel count the most zoom and all that then it added the S Pen and got a little more refined and it replace the note now it's just everything it's just everything in one place it's all the best Hardware all the best software I can think of all in one phone so on the outside like I said my early Impressions this phone looks almost the same as last year's phone but if you think this phone is almost the same as last year's phone turns out
you're missing a lot so the more you use this phone the more you look for weaknesses the more impressive it gets so maybe what you're a you're a screen snob right you like to pixel peep maybe you were thinking about getting one of the ultra high-end Oppo or xiaomi phones just for an amazing screen all right well look no further literally one of the best screens in any phone s24 Ultra has dropped in a class leading 6.8 in Quad HD AMOLED display and it is awesome these Ultra phones have had you know 120
HZ ltpo for a while and they've been this really sharp Quad HD for a while now too but now on top of that two new things one is it's completely flat and two is it's much brighter so there's "been this whole new batch of like 2,500" plus knit phones in the past couple months that I've seen this I think is the best looking one that I've seen so "far so now it's up to a Max 2,600 nits" which is awesome Outdoors or anywhere but it also gets extremely dim at night too without any of the weird banding
I've seen in some other phones and they flattened the display completely and brought the display right up to the very Corners with some of the thinnest bezels we've seen all the way around plus there's also this new anti-reflective coating on this gorilla glass armor that makes a noticeable difference with certain light hitting it at off axis angles and then there is a crazy fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader under underneath to top it all off and you know maybe I wish the touch Target was a
little bit bigger but that's about it honestly if you're a screen snob it doesn't really get better than this one right here this is the phone you should get okay so what if your primary concern is battery life well you could always get the Energizer phone that we saw at CES at one time but as far as reasonably sized Flagship slab phones go it doesn't get much better than this again they're "keeping a 5,000 mAh battery in one of" the best performing battery phones from the past few years despite making it
thinner and keeping the S Pen so you might as well get this one still got 45 watt wired charging you still have 25 watt wireless charging and just battery LifeWise I was able to have long days with no problems with six hours plus the screen on time I was able to baby it into getting two full days that's at 1440p at 120 htz and with high brightness use so yeah why why get anything else so okay what if then it's just performance is the main thing that you care about okay so we're seeing all these phones
with a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 starting to come out and they're looking really good great high-end performance there's efficiency games all over the place plus this phone pairs it with 12 gigs of RAM and it is a multitasking champ and if it's a stylus you're into I already know you weren't really considering any other phone the SP pen is basically the only high-end stylus still going in slab smartphones it's really good for not taking drawing highlighting all that stuff but if you're like me and you
hardly ever use that there's still the gaming performance performance and the everyday performance there's the newly added Ray tracing plus a 90% larger Vapor chamber to cool the phone for much longer stuff turns out it's an A+ now you could always get a gaming phone and squeeze 5 to 10% more frames out of a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 with some huge badass cooling setup and that's great but then you also have to accept all of the sacrifices that come with said gaming phone over this and do you really want
those extra frames that bad depends on who you ask okay cameras there's a lot of other phones out there "that you could buy if your, 1300 bucks" specifically has to go to the best cameras you know the pixel just won the blind camera test Sony has the best manual mode like there's other great camera systems but here's a way to simplify it I think in evaluating smartphone cameras there's basically two ways to review them there's the utility the actual technical evaluation and the Aesthetics the art of it the
subjectivity part and I think utilitywise like on paper specs wise this this camera's got it all like you've seen this camera array before there's four cameras on the back of this phone turns out they're basically the same cameras as last year's s23 Ultra except for one so there's a primary camera an ultrawide and a pair of two different telephoto cameras the primary camera is still the ridiculous 200 megapixel sensor with all the same pros and cons it's consistent and versatile
across the board it has great dynamic range it's a quick shooter with quick autofocus and it's also always binning down to 12 megapixels and you should almost never switch it to the 200 megapixel mode unless you have incredible lighting it has an ultra wide with a bit of distortion near the edges but it's actually meaningfully wider than the primary camera so it's really fun to shoot with even though the automatic macro mode from it looks like trash and you should just turn it off
anytime it turns your pictures from this to this Pro tip and then it has a medium range 3x telephoto camera that kicks in smooth smooth L and matches the colors and exposure from the main camera really well and so the one new thing in Hardware this year is they've gone from a 10 megapixel 10x camera to a 50 megapixel 5x camera so technically shorter optical zoom range but I would say with the extra resolution it is actually more powerful it means all the photos in the gap between 5x and 10x
look sharper than last year and then you can literally put the 10x photos side by side from the s23 ultra and the s24 Ultra and the new 5x cropped in actually looks better plus you can still Zoom all the way in and shoot at 100x if you still want to take Ultra stable pictures of Far Away objects like the moon but basically what I'm saying is utilitywise this camera system checks every single box it has everything so from there you get into the more subjective aesthetic
differences which you could always lean one way or the other I think I mean looking at these photos they are still very much Samsung's slightly extra process looking a little bit extra contrasty a little bit higher exposure a little brighter colors that still happens with these photos so you could still convince yourself to lean pixel or even iPhone but if you just want to be able to check every single box why look anywhere else honestly the changes that you notice more aside from the actual
camera quality are just like features using it like the s24 ultra shoots everything HDR by default now it's actually in Google's new Ultra HDR format so when you have you know specular highlights or big dynamic range differences in a photo it will Tastefully crank up that stuff for a more dramatic looking picture on the phone screen similar to what pixel and iPhone already do and this passes through all the way from capturing the photo to viewing it in the gallery and then one more step to actually
publishing it on social media so Samsung has worked with Instagram and Snapchat for Native quality photo and video uploading pipelines because at the end of the day once you take the photo what are you 99% of the time planning to do with it share it and I think this is this is important for a lot of people this is one of the reasons I have carried an iPhone for years is one of the things you can always count on is the photos and videos in third party apps are going to look just as good as
if they were captured in the main camera and now you can actually say that that is true now about photos and videos from this phone at least in Instagram and Snapchat all right maybe your a software person maybe the top of your list when buying a new smartphone is you want the smartest smartphone it's got to have all the software and AI features and honestly it should have a nice long road map ahead of it of ontime software updates sounds like I'm describing a pixel but turns out this phone now has a
ton a ton of helpful AI features built in that are actually good they make a meaningful difference to Everyday Use now the funny part about a lot of this is a lot of these features are made in partnership with Google as you'll see and I can't help but keep thinking like it feels like Samsung needs Google to have all of these features in their phone to compete especially against the iPhone but then Google Now their own phones are a little bit less competitive but it's probably worth the trade-off
because now technically they're helping to compete against the iPhone it's this weird like thing where they need each other I I think it's fascinating and probably worth its own separate video maybe let me know with a comment or by subscribing if you'd be down to see that but that's all the background all this so we were just talking about photos a second ago the second you're done taking a photo and opening it up in Samsung's Gallery app there's a ton of useful AI driven
stuff that you can do with it and it's kind of all based on what sort of scene it autod detects that you've taken so lots of photos just end up with a remaster button where you click it and then it can add some contrast and brighten things up a little bit as needed and gives you a solid before and after but if your photo has some glass or a window it'll show you an erase reflection button and then you can literally go in and circle the reflections you want to get rid of and it'll generative fill what should
actually be in the glass and it works pretty well now with this photo I didn't take it in portrait mode but it's recognized that there's a subject and so it'll offer to add background blur and even without a bunch of extra depth information it analyzes the subject and it lets me add a little bit or a lot of background blur with a pretty damn good cutout if you ask me to just create a portrait mode shot out of thin air but if you ever really really want to go crazy there's a whole separate magic
editor that feels exactly like what we just got with the pixel minus any restrictions it's never told me it can't do something so you open any photo hit that edit button and then there's this little blue green button with the Stars that's Samsung's new magic editor and once you're here you can just go nuts you can move the subject around a photo and have a generative fill in the background or you can have it remove things entirely from the foreground or the background of a photo like Photo
bombers or just unnecessary random objects I actually found this super useful but probably actually my favorite one underrated you know how normally when you need to tilt a photo like fix the Horizon you end up cropping in and losing some of the outside of the photo you can still do that but with this magic editor you can open it up and tilt The Horizon to whatever angle you want and instead of cropping it will literally generative fill in the outsides of the photo which works very
well because usually the outside of the photo is the least important part of the photo you can get away with generative fill and by the way literally all the stuff works with photos you download to the phone too not just photos you've taken on the camera but photos you just get wherever just like the pixel now I also find it hilarious that if you use the magic Editor to alter a photo on this phone it'll add a little Watermark to the bottom corner with this little stars so that you know that this photo
was AI manipulated which is good that's a good responsible thing to do especially if you're going to upload this to social media but then you can also immediately erase that watermark with a built-in object removal tool in Samsung's photo editor app there's nice little section in the settings where Samsung's tucked all of the AI features of this phone it's called advanced intelligence instead of artificial intelligence still AI though uh that's where you get stuff like the live phone
call translation feature or the new voice recorder app getting much improved speaker labels and summaries and transcriptions the Samsung browser will now do uh summaries of web pages this might all sound very familiar but the best new one in my opinion is circle to search now Google Lens has been around for a long time in my opinion one of Google's most underrated products so people might have already known that you could basically do this already but it would take several steps
Circle to search just makes it one step and it's much faster it's pretty awesome you literally just hold down on the home button or the gesture bar at the bottom and then Circle or tap whatever on your screen that you want to Google search and it just immediately Googles over the top of whatever you were doing without leaving that app and it's so useful just even during the week I've been using this phone I've searched pictures parts of pictures before it almost always works just like uploading it to Google
Lens I've searched objects right in front of me through the camera viewfinder I've searched random landmarks you can also search text and you can even append text to your search and I was just constantly impressed by how fast it is and it basically works as expected every single time the one fidgety part is sometimes selecting text to gets a little weird using the Spen can solve that a little bit to just get a more precise selection but yeah once you do do it it's much faster than if
you're going to use Google Lens having to like take a screenshot and then upload it through lens and then maybe have to crop it and the whole thing this is just fast now real ogs will know that there used to be a feature on pixels called now on tap it was like the same exact thing hold the home button and it would just Google whatever was on your screen and help you out but that was everything on your screen and they kind of ended up wrapping that into Google Assistant this is just so much faster
and more selective also pixels are going to get this feature very soon as well but then bonus points if you really love software Samsung is now promising 7 years of security updates and seven generations of major software updates on this phone on this s24 lineup I assume seven generations of software updates is basically 7even years that means this phone will be up to date in 2031 loving that so we know the common wisdom was that if you wanted four five six plus years of software updates or if
you want every single little software and AI feature you basically had to go iPhone or pixel but now that this phone also has that why get anything else but speaking of the iPhone they're going at them too now I know I said in the "beginning of this video $1,300 slab" Android phone so I know the iPhone 15 Pro Max was never really on the table but if we're being honest Samsung has never been shy about competing directly against the iPhone so why not take some of the best stuff from there too they
weren't being subtle about it so they've got this shiny brand new titanium color with titanium rails on the s24 ultra just like the iPhone they have flattened the screen and the sides and made box your Corners all the way through the lineup just like the iPhone they have moved to a Max 5x telephoto lens like I talked about earlier also just like the iPhone they also have this new always on display that doesn't just show the time but shows your whole wallpaper now kind of like it's half awake just like the
iPhone thankfully you can also turn that off and save some battery just like the iPhone you can so now long press to select an object in a photo that automatically cuts it out and makes it a sticker you can use in other apps just like the iPhone and there's even these new lock screen widgets now that look exactly like the iPhones like like copy my homework but don't even worry if they know you copied it these two are going to keep copying each other till the end of time none of this is a surprise it's
just at the end of the day we are technically winning because they're making each other a little bit better bit by bit but at the end of the day s24 Ultra I really do feel like feels it feels like Peak slab phone there's also a whole bunch of stuff I didn't even really mention with this phone the haptics are really nice I didn't even get to that there's AI generated wallpapers a whole section for them if you're into that and it's nice that the AI stuff is mostly kind of tucked away
in ways where you don't ever have to use it if you don't want to but if you notice it and it's helpful to you bam turn it on could be your favorite feature really the only things that I miss from the pixel specifically are call screening and and now playing so really the best argument not to buy this "$1,300 phone is the fact that it's a" "$1,300 phone and the truth is you can" get 98% of the phone for much less money you can see it in Samsung's own lineup "Samsung's own s24 plus has a 4,900 mAh"
"battery instead of 5,000 it has a 6.7 in" display instead of 6.8 and it drops the Spen and one of the telephoto cameras for $300 off and you know you get uh the regular s24 again for much less money with almost as much phone so you don't "have to spend 1,300 bucks on a phone but" if you are going to and you put the word Ultra in the name and you stuff as much stuff in one phone as you possibly can this is the one that you should get this has all the things it's reliable it's
fast it does everything it checks all the boxes this phone's great kind of feels like an ad when I just say all these positive things about the phone but it's not until right now this video is sponsored by Ridge the ridge wallet is Iconic at this point it's a minimalist modern wallet it's like the opposite of those old school wallets it's got the patented dual track design that expands to hold one to 12 cards while being as Slim as possible and at this point there's like 30 plus different colors
