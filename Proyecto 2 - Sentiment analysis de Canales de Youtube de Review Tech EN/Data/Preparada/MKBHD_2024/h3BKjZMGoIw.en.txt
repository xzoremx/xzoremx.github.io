so it's a bit of a tradition around here to unbox the newest iPhones on the day they come out and we're upholding a tradition this year to find one single difference versus last year's unboxings so we've got four iPhones here in new colors iPhone 16 and 16 plus which the boxes show the back of the phones and then 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max which show the front and I'm totally going to start with the base phones the crowd favorites this year finally some colors back in the iPhone lineup so I'm going to call
this one the flagship color this is the ultramarine iPhone 16 and in the Box you get the USBC cable again braided in high quality and then a tiny little bit of paperwork in this pill shape and then you'll notice no SIM card tool same as last year and no stickers this year there are no stickers included in the iPhone 16 box at all truly the end of an era they just can't stop removing things they can't help El but let's get a look at the pink plus-size phone too these phones are the
same sizes as last year 6.1 in for the base 6.7 in for the plus but with the bigger batteries inside that's something I'm really happy to hear about and very curious about in my testing but really I'm just happy we finally have colors back so the back of the phone it's a little more pale but the glass around the camera is a bit darker the rails of the phone are a bit darker so this is nice same stuff in the box now with these Pro phones I think there's a reason they show the front of the phone
on the box because if they show the back you literally could not tell the difference versus last year but hey at least this one has slightly thinner bezels they can show and yeah this here is going to be the natural titanium 16 Pro and aside from the lack of stickers in the Box it's going to look and feel basically exactly like a titanium iPhone 15 Pro same USBC cable as the base phone as well great but then this is the new flagship Pro color the renders we saw at first were kind of weird but this is the
official desert titanium color and you know all of Apple's phones are again a bit more pale on the back but they have more color on these rails and that's definitely true again here it's kind of a like a light sand color but also feels similar to the gold of the past but there you have it that's the iPhone 16's unboxing experience so by the time you see this uploaded that means I am deep into my iPhone 16 testing and working on the full review so definitely get subscribed to see that when it drops but
if there are any things that you specifically want to see talked about more or that haven't been talked about enough for the review of the phones let me know in the comment section below but I can still give you now some quick things that I've noticed in my first couple days my first week of testing some FAQs so first up there is a size difference versus last year the base phones are the same sizes like I said 6.1 and 6.7 in in the same body sizes but the pro phones are are both bigger
the 16 Pro goes from 6.1 to 6.3 in and even though it has thinner bezels yes the phone is slightly taller and slightly wider and then the 16 Pro Max goes from 6.7 in to 6.9 in diagonally which is now just an absolutely gigantic phone I mean it was already huge but it's now even taller and wider biggest phone they've ever made if you look at it next to the Galaxy s24 Ultra that's another absolutely huge phone for some context and that phone has a stylus in it so obviously Apple's put more battery
in this phone which is great to see I'm glad they're not going the opposite direction of like making it thinner or shrinking the batteries but yeah just it's definitely get to know if you're going with the new Pro Max this year you getting a truly huge like borderline tablet size phone also random tidbit thanks to these new cameras up in the corners these new iPhones are big time table rockers like big time uneven camera on the back it's annoying to me cuz I type on the table sometimes anyway
I've also been taking some pictures and videos with the new cameras I'll be taking and posting many many more if you want to follow me on Instagram that's where you'll see some more in the next couple days but I'll link that below my first impression is it's it's kind of remarkable how consistent Apple's image processing pipeline is to get the same look every year like a lot of times you see companies switch sensors even the pixel switch sensors after using the same old one for a while and the whole
look kind of changed but it really feels like year-over-year no matter how many Hardware changes no matter how many sensor changes these phones go go through they still just have very much have the iPhone look which I mean makes sense this just shallower depth of field from the larger physical sensor I have also run some benchmarks so these are the new geekbench six scores for the new a18 and a18 Pro in these phones which are new versus last year really not noticing like a huge difference in
performance with these brand new phones obviously you're going to feel that more at the very high end and in the long term as these phones age but what geekbench also did reveal is all of these phones across the board have 8 gigs of RAM now so there's typically been different amounts of ram in the Pro phone versus the regular phone now there's not now they all have 8 gigs of RAM so Apple was giving us a lot of talk in that keynote about how these are the first phones built from the ground up for Apple
intelligence is that what this means I mean you clearly need a lot of memory to run these AI models and there's also a more powerful neural engine on all the phones versus last year so maybe that's a part of it too but all that talk and these phones all launch with iOS $18 o which has exactly zero Apple intelligence features on them at launch out the box but that's a rant for another day but clearly the biggest physical new change on these new phones is this added button here and apple refused to call it
a button in the keynote and then doubled down they also they did a bunch of like executive interviews on various YouTube channels that you can go watch from that day and even in those interviews they continue to refuse to call it a button it's so weird just put out the biggest burning fire right up front in the discourse it is a real button right it's it's it's a physical thing that depresses right I think it's a first of its kind it's there is a there is a a tactile switch that gives you
that that final click so just to clear it up it is an actual moving clicking physical button that is called camera control but it's also it's more than a button it's also made it to all these phones not just the pros so let me jump into that this camera control button as the name implies only controls camera related things so it's not like another action button it's a camera control button you can hit it once it opens up the camera you can hit it again to take a photo and then you can hold it down to
start recording a quick video but it's also a large capacitive touch sensitive surface with a vibration motor underneath so it doesn't actually half press but with that vibration motor it can mimic the feeling of a half press like a real camera would have and you can double tap to flip through various camera controls like Zoom or photographic Styles or tone it takes some getting used to I mean these swipes they also you can see have momentum physics too so you can swipe too fast or
too far and go past what you were aiming for or Zoom past where you thought you would so it can feel a bit finicky and silly as you start using it especially since you can literally do all this stuff with the buttons already on the screen but when you use camera control all of the rest of those buttons just fade away and disappear kind of of encouraging you to continue using the camera control to find what you're trying to do it's really interesting uh the placement feels like it was made
with landscape in mind but landscape ideally would have been at the corner uh but they also know a lot of people take photos and videos like this so it can't be all the way at the bottom so they moved it up so it's kind of splitting the difference here uh and also thirdparty apps will be able to plug into it if they use the camera so this is already working with Kino and it's supposed to start working with Snapchat pretty soon as well and you can imagine other apps that use a camera will just
decide what they want to do with it I was also curious though and I said this in that original Impressions video how cases would deal with this new button surface thing so it turns out there's basically two options option number one is just a cutout in the side of the case uh just cut it out expose it to the finger so it's fine that's probably what most cheap cases will do but that also means it's no longer going to be flush with the side of the case but then there's option number two which is what
Apple's first-party cases do which is putting in this little insert which has glass and transfers the capacitance from the button outside of the case to the camera control of the phone itself and maintaining that flush feel and it feels like it works pretty well the half press still works fine the swiping still works fine the vibration motor transfers through and the Beats By Dre cases also already have this yeah I'm just going to say that again real quick in case you were just phasing out for a second
there's Beats by Dre iPhone cases now like since when does Beats make cases like why does Beats make cases I thought I don't know there was a theme of like beats being audio products but there's something new going on here maybe now they're just iPhone accessories I don't know but yeah they've got a nice little camera control button thing on their new iPhone cases which is nice I kind of wish and I'm not alone uh that this was also Touch ID but then they couldn't call it camera control I guess I I
wonder if that's in the future of this button but anyway speaking of third party accessories that's where dbrand stepped in to sponsor this video so for this sponsor segment we're going to be doing something a little bit different see uh screen protectors not my favorite thing they're kind of a chore to install between the dust and the alignment and getting it perfect that's a big part of why I don't use them all the time um but that's where Channel sponsor dbrand comes in they seem to believe that I can
install their prism 2.0 screen protector blindfolded so that's what I'm going to try to do uh instructions have been told are pretty simple to just get the screen protector get the phone and then line it up which is like  and then just swipe down the middle to  down give it a couple seconds and then that should be it let's see take this off and that doesn't even look like it's installed but it is it totally is it's and it's perfect nice okay yeah every every pris comes with two of these so if you get the
first one wrong you can get a second try but if you want to check these out for the iPhone or any number of phones that they make for it I'll have a link below all right that's been it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace
