so if I build a new lens and my lens only works with my camera then that's vertical integration or if I build new headphones and my headphones only work with my cable that's vertical integration now if I build a new smartwatch and my SmartWatch only works with my smartphone be careful that might be illegal that's a bit of an oversimplification but let's  it so this is a developing story and will continue to develop for years but I feel like it all comes down to something
that I've at least noticed in talking to all these big companies all these very public multi-billion dooll companies they always have two reasons for any public facing statement that they make there's the reason for the public and then there's the real reason so there was just some news this past week of the US Department of Justice suing app saying that they are an illegal Monopoly in the United States the iPhone specifically now whenever there's legal proceedings obviously things get very
complicated and I won't even pretend to be diving into this at a super deep level but this is also interesting to me because of all the stuff with the things that we talk about every day with just smartphones and gadgets and of course this is a pretty us specific thing like that obviously they're being sued by the us but also their dominance Apple the iPhone is the most popular in the US so I think these are some numbers we should keep in mind in the US the iPhone is at
like 60% market share and it's even way higher up near 90% with young people like it is ridiculously dominant but worldwide the iPhone is at about a 25% market share so the iPhone is specifically trending towards a monopoly  States so here's where it gets really interesting I would like to live in this analogy for this video which is you've heard about people describing Apple's ecosystem as a Walled Garden before this could not be more true right there's this really really nice beautiful
luscious garden and in the middle of that Garden is the iPhone and it has these really tall thick walls all the way around it so in an Ideal World right you are just picking between different options for a product based on its merits based on its features so you just look at the whole lineup and you go yeah I like this one the best and that's how you make your choice right sick but with this one the claim is Apple is making it really really difficult once you've chosen Theirs to ever switch to anything
else so with this analogy again it's really the walls of the garden that we have the issue with so I'll give you I'll do two examples so take the Apple watch right this is this is one of the examples in the department of Justice's 88 page PDF that they've submitted the the iPhone and the Apple watch work perfectly well together and only together it's a feature it's by Design that's how they are so two parts of that are sketchy one is the Apple watch works really well with the iPhone in a way
that no other Smartwatch can and two the Apple watch does not work with any other smartphone so look I don't think it's a surprise that when Apple built a watch they gave it all kinds of Integrations with the iPhone so you can see them working perfectly together you can see and dismiss your notifications you can reply to messages track your Fitness you can even use it as a shutter for your iPhone's camera all these features that they just plug right into the iPhone they work great and I think that's even
what Apple would tell people they would agree like this is how we made it so that they work amazingly well together this is vertical integration it's awesome but there's also the real reason because the truth is now if you try to use any other SmartWatch with the iPhone you just don't get nearly as many of those useful features from being super well integrated if you try to use like a Garmin Smartwatch for example you don't get the viewfinder for the camera you don't get the fitness tracking through
Apple Fitness you don't get quick replies you don't get even image previews to your text messages you don't even get to choose which apps show you notifications it's just all or nothing so if you choose an iPhone then next when you're looking for a smartwatch to buy there's kind of only really one good full-fledged option which is the Apple watch this is also True by the way to various degrees with airpods and air tags and various other things in Apple's ecosystem because they all are great
when you have an iPhone and work super well with it but work horribly or not at all when you don't so that is part of the that's the walls around the ecosystem that make it really hard to leave because if you now want to switch from the iPhone to the Android phone you're not just switching phones you have to now get a new phone and a new watch and new headphones and a new tracker and all this stuff because they all worked so well with the iPhone and so horribly with anything else so that
is a real barrier to people leaving this ecosystem once they get into it so another example is the whole blue Bubbles and green bubbles thing that they do I've already made an entire video about this Dynamic if you haven't already seen it I'll leave a link with the like button below if you want to watch it but basically today when iPhones message other iPhones they have tons of features and typing indicators and highres media and those are blue Bubbles and when they message Android
phones it falls back to SMS which is slow low reses unencrypted trash that is green bubbles and apple just refuses to make iMessage work on Android the Department of Justice actually literally references a video of Tim Cook on stage at a conference where he he says this it's tough uh not to make it personal but I can't send my mom certain videos or she can't send me certain videos and so we bu your mom an iPhone all right and this this is so poetic just because you know obviously
he's got this smile of like you guys all know it's true but also it goes back to what I said at the beginning which is with any of these public facing decisions there's the answer that they give the public and then there's the real reason you know originally iMessage was built back in the days where text messages were basically paid per text like every SMS cost money hence the green so iMessage would work over the internet and be unlimited and it would offer way more features and they'd build on to it
over time adding encryption and reactions and typing indicators all this stuff and apple people and apple themselves would probably all agree like this is it's just a thing that Apple built that's way better than SMS like it's not their fault SMS sucks they just made a better thing uh so yeah of course yeah they're going to build their their own version of a thing and it's not illegal to not also develop it for Android they just made their own thing for the iPhone but also Tim Cook's quote just
buy your mom an iPhone is the other equally valid point it's the real reason there are plenty of internal emails that have surfaced over time with apple Executives openly talking about how giving iMessage to Android would make it easier for people to switch to Android from the iPhone iMessage is clearly one of the walls of the ecosystem and it's it's probably one of the biggest thickest walls like ask any Young person in the US today why they use an iPhone and I think a lot of them would probably
tell you something to do with imessage so is this stuff that they're doing illegal I guess is the question or maybe even another way to phrase it is is Apple making other products worse or are they making their own products really good and then not letting other things outside the ecosystem have access to those things it's kind of both honestly but the thing is they're not the only ones doing a lot of this stuff they are just the ones that happen to be in this pseudo Monopoly position right now like
the pixel watch for example does not work at all with the iPhone it just works perfectly with Android phones but is anybody that mad about that you know RCS is announced to be coming to the iPhone at some point in 2024 but I can almost guarantee it'll probably still be green bubbles it will probably be the absolute bare minimum of supporting RCS and they will probably still be delineating very clearly between iPhone to iPhone iMessage and iPhone to Android something else and there's even more to
this lawsuit like Apple pay is another one how no other services can use the NFC chip on the iPhone um super apps is another one like if you want to look at all this stuff I will link the best stuff I can find down below so my take is Apple is technically yeah guilty of all of these things they're doing all this stuff but in the Walled Garden analogy it's like they have built up a really really nice garden and apple would say like look our gard it's so green and Luscious and beautiful they've
built the most beautiful garden with the most people in it but they've also built up the biggest walls around that garden and so Apple would love to say look everyone's chosen our garden and they're all staying in our garden that's how great it is but even if you saw another Greener softer better Garden somewhere else the walls to escaping to getting to that are just way too high so it's less that each individual thing that they're doing with the products working well together is illegal and it's more that
they feel like they have to do something about this one company having so much power and control in smartphones which is here it's it's essentially a commodity it's just like a thing that everybody has so I want to leave you with this you remember at the beginning when I talked about how Apple's ridiculously dominant in the US and these crazy numbers like 90% of young people the crazy thing is they're super super popular here but as I mentioned they are not a monopoly anywhere else
and why why is that true how are they so popular here and they're doing all the same stuff in other places but they're not a monopoly in other places and so I think of China for example China is another huge smartphone market where WeChat is kind of like this super super app it's a huge thing like it's messaging it's payments it's also calling a taxi and also paying your bills and ordering food groceries like WeChat is everything so just as long as your phone has WeChat then the rest is
kind of doesn't really matter it's up to you and so in China there's this incredibly vibrant Innovative landscape of all these smartphone manufacturers competing like crazy like Huawei xiaomi Oppo and iPhone is in there too but they're all just competing ruthlessly with Hardware features and with other stuff to try to get your attention to maybe pick their phone cuz it's just you're into they all have weat so in a market like that people will buy your phone based on if it's actually better
or not meaning there's lots of Gardens and very few walls around those Gardens that's what a good competitive landscape looks like now what would be maybe illegal or a wrong thing to do is if WeChat or the makers of WeChat of tensent made a phone and then they gave their phone special access to certain parts of WeChat that suddenly no other phone could get then Monopoly so this lawsuit and all this legal versus illegal stuff I it's mainly just a way to try to poke some holes and get closer to that level of
lower Walls and More competition that makes everybody better then we're actually competing on Innovation again but it's something that will be evolving for a long time over time so it'll be interesting to keep an eye on speaking of things that might be illegal shout out to dbrand for sponsoring this video so you might have heard about unless you've been living under a rock you've heard about their grip Case by now so I've got their latest hydro dip cases here and I got to say the name matches
it perfectly you know these days a lot of phone cases are just kind of boring plastic shells but with dbrand they're kind of playing with some stuff and these are some crazy colorways and these trippy hydro dipped patterns plus with the gold rush one if you catch it under the right light you'll notice a little low-key metallic effect under this matte finish which is sick now in addition to the impact protection that you expect from a premium case perfect uh grip cases also have what I
would consider attention to detail so that's two things first of all these buttons they're just really clicky they're nice they're probably better than the actual phones buttons but also in general like we've all eventually dropped a phone whether it's like out of a car or on your face while watching a YouTube video it happens uh ideally this case prevents it because it's it's in the name it's the grip case that's texture is is pretty nice at that so it's hopefully going to prevent that
sort of drop stuff but in the case you do drop it then yeah should be fine it's good so yeah if you want to if you're a case person I would say at least get yourself a nice grip case I'll leave a link below but that's it thanks for watching this video and let me know what you think about these features and the iPhone and everything going on with it and I'll  he
