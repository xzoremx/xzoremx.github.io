all right I been an updated Studio Tour because there is some new stuff since the last time you guys have seen it so first of all this here is a desk with this pegboard it's by Corsair actually a lot of people don't expect that from a computer company but they did a great job with it uh the world's largest iPhone is still here but it's kind of retired doesn't really do as much even though it takes up the space uh but speaking of retired a lot of people asked oh wait how do you still have the
coffin it's sort of in the back of the studio tucked away cuz you wouldn't want it in the middle of the studio that's kind of a weird vibe I guess um and then we have the podcast Studio which is also um it's pretty similar to last time probably you'd recognize most of the stuff in the same spot that typically is um oh sorry that's yeah that's a not really showing people that yet um anyway okay podcast Studio you guys have seen the c500 and everything in here before
