all right it's mid 2024 so you know what that means another new version of iOS coming to an iPhone near you so I've been testing the newest version of iOS 18 on my iPhone for the past couple weeks now it's been in beta and now that the public beta is out you two can test it on an iPhone before it comes out for everyone in September but there is some interesting stuff in this version now last year I remember talking about how almost every single one of those new features was super
ecosystem based like they depend on having a friend with an iPhone or having some other Apple device in your life but it's kind of the opposite with these they're all just basically new features to the iPhone anyway so You' love to see that now for this video the one thing I'm leaving out is Apple intelligence stuff that's like an entire separate bucket of stuff that to be honest hasn't really been available for me to test in the pre-release betas so I'm going to make a separate video just about that
stuff as soon as it's actually testable so be sure to get subscribed to see that when I actually drop that video but this video is a top five of everything else all right number five the new control center so I have this at number five because while there is a good amount of new stuff here I don't know if I like all of the new changes but let me know what you think so when you pull down from the corner the new control center is first of all a little bit more colorful and it's paginated it's three
pages now I'll honestly probably never really use the second two pages but they are a full page page visualizer for whatever media is playing and then a list of all these OneTouch toggles for your basic connectivity but actually turns out this full page list is really just an expanded version of what you already had on the first page so you can get there with a couple more Taps but okay so on that first page if you hit the plus button in the corner it shows a grid and then you can play with the size
and placement of anything that has a tab in that bottom corner so they all kind of have these predefined sizes that they morph between so you can mess around here with you know basically designing your perfect layout for your control screen you can add new controls and there's a whole massive list of them that search through here and surface things that you do often and right now these are basically all Apple app controls what I'm more interested in though is I mean these are all controls
like I said not widgets so they're for controlling things very directly like turning on Wi-Fi or turning up the brightness and so Apple has said that third party apps are going to be able to build in controls as well so there's none here now but I very much look forward to to like a OneTouch turning on the AC in the car or OneTouch opening up the barcode scanner in my calorie tracker app or something like that so just having more controls surfaced in here that's going to be pretty sweet
we've also noticed this new flashlight control which when you click it allows you to control both the intensity and the beam width of the torch for some reason uh the intensity part definitely works the beam width I don't know if I'm as convinced on that one but I guess it's still really cool cool UI oh also there's a new button up here to turn off your phone kind of like Android added a while ago in the settings but also you can now finally change the controls on your lock screen now from the default
which have been the flashlight and the camera for forever you can hold down customize lock screen and get in there and go to town again I hope there's third party ones that end up here but there's already a ton of options I'm excited to set mine to my to-do list app someday but that brings us to number four the number four best new iOS 18 feature and that's the passwords app you know every once in a while there's just a new update that installs a new app on everyone's phones and just drops it on
your home screens so this is one of them but essentially what this is is just breaking out all of the password tools that were previously buried in the settings on the phone and making it an app so your iPhone's been saving your passwords for a while now saving Wi-Fi passcodes remembering all this stuff this app is just a super simple way of finding it all in one place searching through that stuff and making sense of it plus it also supports some new features so there's two Factor
authentication and pass keys and then there's a couple extra things on top that may be good enough to get you to switch from whatever password manager app you're using on your iPhone to Apple's passwords app so at the bottom left you can create shared passwords and pass Keys within a group of trusted contacts works with other people with iPhones anyway and then when you're signing up for some new account somewhere it'll do the same thing it always does it offers a super secure
password and then offers to remember it for you but what I found interesting is it doesn't really have like a master password it just just seems on the iPhone to default to face ID so if you've got face ID on your iPhone It'll ask for that to log in no master password really the main reason I'm not going to be using this app is because I stole daily an Android phone and of course they did not make an Android version of this passwords app they did make a Mac app and they also did make a
Chrome extension which is interesting but yeah no Android app and I still log into a bunch of stuff on Android so it's not for me but number three is going to have to be the new home screen customization some of you might have expected this to be higher like number one or number two but I have my reasons and maybe let me know if you agree with them so the day has finally come there is new customization stuff available to iPhone home screens kind of I mean there's some good stuff and also some
weird stuff I'll start with the stuff I like here's the easy part iPhone users can now put their icons anywhere on their home screens that they want welcome to 2024 iPhone users who's got it better than you now everything still snaps to the grid of course but now you can actually put icons on the right side or the bottom of your home screen where they'll actually be reachable and they won't have to snap back up to the top how cool is that first they give you widgets now they
give you this it's unbelievable stuff but now okay if you want to customize even further you hold down on anywhere on the home screen and there's a little edit button at the top you hit that and then you hit customize and then this is it this is the entire home screen customization menu now for the iPhone so you can go dark mode which tints your wallpaper a little darker and then sets your icons that have a dark mode version to dark mode or you could set light mode which is the opposite it sets your icons
to light and it ttin your wallpaper light and then automatic but there's also this large button here which just makes all of your icons larger but then also removes the text honestly kind of clean not going to lie but then there's this tinted button which feels kind of cursed so this is already kind of a weird looking icon when you click it it lets you tint the color of all the icons on your home screen to a single matching color which sounds kind of cool in theory to match your wallpaper and
actually there's even a Color Picker to drop exactly the same color that you're using from your wallpaper as your tint color but there's just something about this tint that I can't quite get right like I haven't gotten any combination to really look that good at all now there's been some updates on this since the first beta uh still doesn't look look great like it looks better than before but here's what I think is going on here there are certain apps that are like pretty simple and high contrast icons
that look fine like some of them are Apple apps some of them are third party apps and then especially Apple widgets like look at this weather widget that looks great that looks really solid with this nice accent color because it keeps everything really readable but then there are also some third party app icons and widgets that just look completely illegible like they may need to be updated to support this tinting thing in a more contrasty way so it's the mixing of these two that look weird
like even on my home screen look at carrot like the weather app or superlist they look worse than the rest of the icons on my home screen I think the standard that they're aiming for is like a dark gray background with a tinted glyph in the middle instead of the whole thing being tinted so it is what it is I will also say Google has also tried this with material u in Android and it also kind of went weird in its own different unique way basically it would set all the icons to a monochrome version but if
an app didn't support it it just didn't change so a lot of people had a mix of monochrome icons and colorful icons which also doesn't look good at all so I guess the tinting method could be considered a workaround I'm sure people will play with this more icons will continue to get updates I'm sure someday maybe it'll look great for some people but I haven't seen that yet but all right number two for me is the little things again there are a bunch of tiny little things and small features that
individually are not huge but they'll kind of feel like they add up to a bunch of useful things in the end a lot of them didn't even make the keynote but like game mode for example they talked about this we know that when you have a game open it gives it CPU priority and minimizes Bluetooth latency for any wireless headphones or controllers that's the really simple thing but it's nice the photos app also got a redesign but I also am more impressed with the smart search inside of photos it works
much better so if I search for something like license plate for example not only does it recognize and find all the photos in your gallery with license plates but it also gives you these suggestions to narrow it down to find the exact one that you're looking for and it actually works I've also noticed they added a bunch of shortcuts to Shazam everywhere including an action button preset as one of the new defaults in the settings app this wasn't here before I thought that was interesting
and then I Googled it and apparently Apple bought Shazam not that long ago which I totally forgot about so there you have more of that and RCS support does appear to finally be live on the iPhone in 20 2024 it's going great now as I predicted it is still a green bubble but you can now finally text between any modern Android phone and an iPhone and actually get high quality media I sent myself a 3 megabyte image file from the iPhone and I got a full quality 3 megabyte image on Android and
there's also now typing indicators and read receipts now reactions seem to be working well so it's not fully integrated into a blue bubble iMessage like maybe some people were hoping but Apple can now say that they finally did it and now that person from that one interview doesn't have to buy his mom an iPhone but then number one the number one best new feature in iOS 18 bro it's a calculator it's actually the calculator now you might have thought this was just an iPad thing cuz we we
all saw this get demoed at the keynote in iPad OS 18 but it actually is on the iPhone as well so as a default you open up the calculator app it just looks like a basic calculator this looks very familiar but at the bottom left there's this little toggle where you can switch to a scientific calculator okay pretty classic or you can switch to this new thing called math notes and now it basically looks like a Notes app so you can create a new note and literally just start handwriting math notes literally
you can write an equation and if you happen to write that equal sign it can automatically solve that equation for you and keep it updated as you continue writing or typing it's pretty simp there are also all kinds of other things it can do from variables to graphs it's basically doing everything I was asking wolf from alpha to do lately but a kind of underrated part of this is how it it feels very well considered and it's also syncing across devices just like as a bunch of notes so your calculator just
kind of gained a notes section so if you add a bunch of stuff to notes on your iPhone the iPad with the calculator has all the same notes and you can edit them on the other device and if you happen to redefine a variable lower down in the same note then it actually knows then from that point on to treat that variable as the new value you gave it but keeps the old value for everything above it it's it's very well impressively thought out now obviously this stuff is going to be easier with a
bigger screen and with a apple pencil but man I was doing all this stuff in school with a paper notebook and a TI 84 so at the risk of sounding kind of old I totally wish I had something like this when I was in school it's very impressive it's doing so so many things it's recognizing my handwriting it's obviously answering the equations I'm asking of it but it's also writing the answers in my own handwriting and then it's straightening everything up and it's making everything searchable and
indexable through not just that math notes app in all the devices but across my whole phone so it's pretty sick I'm impressed by this more than anything else I've seen in iOS 18 so that's why it's my number one feature in iOS 18 but there's your whole top five but like I said get subscribed to see a deep dive into Apple intelligence cuz this is the thing that kind of permeates the entire iPhone and Apple's whole ecosystem so that video is coming up soon and that's been it for this thanks for watching
catch you in the next one peace
