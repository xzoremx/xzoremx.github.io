hey what's up y'all I'm kbd here and today Samsung had their expected summer unpacked event in July and they announced two new phones and three new wearable devices well it's more than that if you count like the small and the large sizes but a lot of stuff I got to go Hands-On with all of it and so here are my first impressions so I'm going to start with the two new phones this was the reveal of the newest foldables so you got Z flip 6 and Z fold 6 and in general these phones are very much still
minor iterations on top of the last year shocker I was actually thinking about that like this kind of feels like a dismissive way of saying it like oh Samsung settled they're not really changing anything which is kind of true but also on the other hand these are still phones that are at the Forefront of two of some of the most advanced parts of the tech World which is foldables and AI so there's that so yeah the fold six the big one looks just like the fold five you know square up the
sides a bit more change up the look of the camera housing just a little bit and give it slightly thinner bezels on the inside and the outside and that makes the cover screen just a tiny bit more usable and now both of these screens get up to 2600 nits now give it the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 give it some new colors and that's about it you got yourself a new generation I mean there's a couple other even smaller things like you know a slightly better hinge there is a new Ultra wide camera and the
square sides I think give it a little bit more interior volume which allows for a 60% larger Vapor chamber for better cooling but aside from that like same battery size same general form factor same unders screen camera on the inside just a lot of the same stuff I think more of the focus for this phone and for the others of course is this new AI this galaxy AI thing that they're pushing to the Forefront and so kind of similarly to what Apple just did a couple months ago is they're trying to
surface all the AI things that they've been doing and some new stuff to the top so you can see it all in one place so regular people actually use it and they also kind of brand it Galaxy AI sure so now in the settings app right at the top there's this new Galaxy AI section full of all of the newest features some of them genuinely useful I'll say others maybe not so much like call assists okay clearly that can be useful like there's things like The Interpreter you can speak back and forth with people in
different languages that's cool note assist uh is going to help people summarize things inside the notes app transcript assist will summarize voice notes all these things are are pretty standard we've seen them before if you use Samsung's browser instead of Chrome for some reason you can hit that stars AI button and get all the summarization you'd want of any web page that has a bunch of text on it we've seen that before generative fill of some extra information from a photo you've taken is
also not new but now it's new to Samsung's Gallery app so if you want to make a photo a wider angle than it actually was when you took it or maybe just straight in a horizon or something and you to fill in some Corners it seems to do a surprisingly good job at that but then there's also drawing assist which can take something you draw or sketch in notes even if you're an absolute piss poor artist like myself and uh it generates art in any number of different styles from it in Samsung
Notes this looks almost exactly like what Apple's like image playground app is doing the watercolor style a little more tame but then there's also this 3D cartoon style and if you give it some time honestly pretty impressive I don't know if this is good art but it's just a lot you know there that's a lot to do with my finger painting So anyway the Z flip 6 is again along a lot of the same lines as the Z fold 6 so again Snapdragon 8 gen 3 squared up sides slightly refreshed design and spec-wise
they've kind of matched a lot of things with the bass s24 so it actually has the camera from the Bas s24 the 50 megapix main camera and the 12 megapix ultrawide the battery gets bigger it goes from "3700 up to 4,000 mamp hour which is" promising and that inside screen does also get to 2600 now as well and there's a wide variety of like widgets for the outside screen so ideally it just gets a little bit more useful than before and it also gets a vapor chamber for the first time in a flip and a new base of
12 gigs of RAM and there's these new colored metal rings around the cameras so you can kind of visually tell oh this is the new one like I'm convinced that the only reason they did these rings but yeah we'll have to see if these phones and their folding screens age better than the previous generation obviously a slightly better hinge can help but as far as I can tell they just look like the same level of crease the same feel of a hinge just overall very similar Hardware package to the last year the
cherry on top though is these phones are both a hundred bucks more than last year so the Z flip 6 is going to be $10.99 "instead of $1,000 and then the fold is" going to be $118.99 instead of $1799 so it's the direction they're trending but then there's also the wearable stuff that they announced and I think people will be just as interested in maybe even more interested in the wearables than the phone refresh stuff so there's two new watches two new earbuds and the ring so the Galaxy watch
7 gets a nice little refresh nothing too dramatic it still looks super familiar and it stays starting at 299 for the 40mm but then they've dropped in a big one there is a Galaxy watch 7 Ultra in the lineup now we saw the rumors I talked about on the waveform podcast this is something that we've been kind of expecting for a bit and what they finally come up with is titanium body sapphire crystal display same size 1.5 in circular display as the 44mm but a much beefier body around it to fit in a
590 mAh battery water resistant to 100 m they gave it a new watch face dual frequency GPS which is also coming to the watch 7 and as you can see they gave it this big orange button called the action but sorry I mean uh the quick button it's called the quick button which is a custom mappable yes activity button that can start any number of different activities or workouts or whatever you want it to do I mean look it's clear that this is targeted at the Apple watch Ultra I don't think they're
trying to hide that at all it's literally the same name but this one is also $650 instead of Apple's $800 so my question is basically just how do they Stack Up head-to-head battery wise it may actually be better they're saying it can do 100 hours in power saving mode but also you know feature-wise accuracy wise we'll see Samsung is also doing this new thing where they basically compile all of your health metrics from everything they measure into one score an energy score with AI
and I want to give that a shot as well but yeah this is basically just an obvious entry to give you an option at that higher price point like Apple's done with their Ultra watch so now it's going to be out there now they also announced the new Galaxy buds 3 and buds 3 Pro and they have obvious equivalents and other ecosystems as well but there's some new cases and new designs here everyone's saying actually aesthetically they look like the first generation airpods which they're not wrong
especially at the top but then these long stems on the buds Pro actually have these blade lights to indicate different modes or statuses which is pretty interesting and then of course they beef up the pros over the regular buds with things like ambient mode and soft tips and this new adaptive noise cancellation that goes up or down based on the surroundings like sirens so the buds 3 are 179 and the buds Pro are $249 but last but not least they finally gave us details on the ring that thing that they
teased I don't know how many months ago it was when we first saw it and the idea is pretty simple it's a ring it's a 24/7 Fitness tracker something that you can wear not just while you're awake but when you sleep and when you shower and going swimming and all that stuff something you just always have on you now I've actually never tested a smart ring before believe it or not I play a lot of sports with my hands I've never worn a ring for a long time but from what I understand the aura
ring is basically the standard that everyone is kind of familiar with so I'm assuming Samsung is going to at least try to match what the AA r does so we finally get to see this Samsung ring and it looks basically exactly like any other smart ring pretty minimal on the outside actually a slightly concave design to avoid scratching which I think is pretty clever and then it comes in three different finishes on a titanium frame there's matte black or silver or gold I'll give you one guess of what my
favorite is uh it's 7 mm wide and 2.6 mm thick the sensors are all on the inside as expected so heart rate skin temperature accelerometer Etc and it's also it's water resistant to 100 m as well so this thing is claiming a roughly 7-Day battery life depending on your size and once it's dead you can pop it on this clever little charging case that when you do it kind of lights up a ring around the ring to show you your charging status which is kind of cool and it should give you about 1 and 1
half more times the total life of the Ring until you charge it all up again and then the price will be $3.99 which is a 100 bucks more than the base Ora ring price but the difference here here is no subscription cost so the or ring does have a subscription it's like six bucks a month and that eventually adds up but this will just be $3.99 for the watch it gets all the features all the Samsung Health stuff but you also must use a Samsung Galaxy phone and the Samsung Health app so yeah
I'm happy to see some competition that isn't a subscription uh and that's kind of it that's that is what Samsung announced today it's two new phones it's two new earbuds it's two new watches and the ring and that's uh all hitting shells relatively soon all pretty premium priced as well wow that was an alliteration that was total accident but yeah all the stuff's coming out soon now before you go what if I told you this phone is worth a million dollar and it's not actually but let me
explain what channel sponsor dbrand has going on here so this is their latest drop called case hardened so if you've ever played Counter-Strike apparently you'll already know about the in-game economy for case harden skins in fact just last month this AK-47 apparently sold for over a million dollar like actual dollars apparently this blue gem skin is about a 1 in 21 million like ultra rare now real Counter-Strike fans are probably already typing comments about how dbrands case hardened isn't
random and there aren't any actual blue gems but here's the thing just like in the game dbrand made thousands of case hardened patterns and yes some of them are random blue gems it won't be quite one in 21 million but they look awesome uh both designs have a sort of a metallic Sheen the way the light plays off them kind of makes it fun to stare at the back of your phone instead of the front maybe that's healthy but I'll leave a link Down Below in the description in case you want to check it
out and spice up your device cuz yeah Samsung does not exactly go hard with the colors usually yeah either way that's been it let me know what you think of these new devices and these new wearables and which ones you want to see reviews of first thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace oh
