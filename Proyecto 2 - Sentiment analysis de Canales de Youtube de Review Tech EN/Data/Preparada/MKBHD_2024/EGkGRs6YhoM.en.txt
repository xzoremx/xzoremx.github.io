so I really like these new pixel phones new designs this year obviously but also new specs new features also new issues but of course new price tags so we really got to jump into the nitty-gritty   so we've been hoping for a real complete Flagship quality competitor from Google for a while now and on one hand it feels like we finally got him but on the other hand did you guys watch the Google event announcing these things like I feel like you can learn a lot about how a company
really feels about the products that they're presenting by just watching the announcement event and these felt like a software showcase that just also happened to have some phones to go with it which I guess is not insane when you know the history of Nexus and pixel but it did the opposite of giveing me confidence in these phones but now I've been using these phones for two weeks straight and I actually feel like I can  so Hardware is mostly what I'm talking about when I say these phones feel like
flagships in a good way like it would be easy to dismiss them as almost the same as last year just squared up but there are a lot of other little things too like the screens are brighter at their Max brightness 2700 nits for the pixel 9 "and 3,000 nits for the 9 pros and then" the even bezels all the way around that requires some extra consideration wrapping the edges of the OLED panels under those corners and there's a new ultrasonic fingerprint reader under here on on all of them finally it's way
faster and more reliable than the disappointing Optical ones from before the only thing I wish it's such a small thing but I wish I could just unlock at any time when the display is completely off like currently you have to have the always on display on or hit the power button or be getting a notification and then you can unlock with a quick touch but like on Samsung phones that spot on the display is always a hot spot no matter what you can just unlock by touching there so I kind of wish the
pixel would let me do that from a blank screen too the haptics are really nice again and the buttons are really clicky this year but then of course the hardware is what's on the inside too so that is the new tensor G4 chip and a bunch of extra Ram now the tensor G4 isn't actually that much more powerful than last year's chip in fact you probably won't notice the difference for 99% of the stuff you do on the phone but what's actually significant is a new npu that's way more
powerful and dedicated to AI tasks and the way more RAM is also dedicated to AI tasks I'm told a big portion of the ram is literally reserved for AI stuff so I will get to all that AI stuff in a minute don't worry but just in the world that we're living in where the meta for a lot of these major new smartphones is okay minor new improvements here and there but mainly just a bunch of new AI features and capabilities I'm glad that the pixel also got a bunch of meaningful feeling Hardware stuff too and then
obviously yes you do have the squared off sides that I just know are supposed to fit in with the iPhones and Samsungs of the world I've said it before I like the look and feel and that also applies to this new camera visor Which is less of a visor and I guess more of like a shelf Island now kind of looks a bit weird in some renders but you just kind of have to trust me seeing it in person it's fire I like it even if it will totally collect dust in just the same way as last year in the corners it's
nice oh and I forgot there is a new size so you can have a pro phone but without it being an XL love the choice I am a little worried that that one probably won't sell as well as the two extremes but I'm just I'm glad we have the choice this year be happy about it before it gets discontinued so anyway it all sounds pretty good but I do have a few "gripes which I'm allowed to it's $1,000" so the size of the batteries is about the same as last year 4700 Mah hours and "the smaller size ones 5,000 Mah hours in"
the big phone and I've had pretty good battery life like a minus battery life with the XL consistently five plus hours of screen on time lots of heavy High brightness use but they still don't charge that fast like the XL is maxing out at like 37 watts and it's actually slightly slower on the smaller phones now I'm not saying you got to go Thermon nuclear level real me 320 W fast charging light your phone on fire charging or anything like that I'm just saying fast charging would be nice 50 60
watts that's it I feel like that's just not that insane but would be significantly better for using the phone now I also need to say pixel 9 has matte sides with glossy back but the pixel9 pro has glossy sides with the matte back we've seen the strategy before I just think the matte sides look and feel so much better than the glossy so I kind of wish you could get like a matte on matte look but that's just me and then one more thing of course these phones start at higher prices or at least the base
"one starts at $7.99 but this is a $1,000" phone that starts at 128 gigs of storage thanks Apple I guess that's the standard now too but it's 2024 I would  start so cameras have always been a big part of the Google Phone experience or at least they have for a while now and on Pixel 99's that's still true but not in exactly the same way so all across the board the pixel 9 and 9 Pro actually share the same primary camera and the same Ultra wide the pros just get that extra telephoto the 5x zoom and the
primary camera that they all share is basically the same as last year the ultra wide is new it's 48 megapixels instead of 12 but it bends down to 12 so look shooting with these new cameras it's great it's a quick smartphone camera app there's a bunch of easy to use modes it's responsive focus is quick it's easy to get consistent good pictures that process pretty quickly what I mostly notice about these photos is they still look very processed to me like this is the pixel look now these
days with the last few Generations just lots of HDR lots of contrast lots of dynamic range also lots of sharpening it's just not as natural of a look as we've seen in some others it's just more it's more on The Punchy side which is honestly great for just sharing a photo on social media but some may prefer a more neutral photo the new selfie camera on the pro actually feels like the biggest Improvement as far as detail and color over the regular pixel 9 which doesn't get this but I'd say this is a
pretty nice selfie camera just so much dynamic range but if you want to see and hear what video footage from the pixel sounds like I shot an entire video on the autofocus channel on the pixel 9 Pro XL in 4k 30 with actually no external hardware I didn't even plug in a mic this is just the built-in mics so yeah just me holding a phone if you don't zoom in at all the videos look great they're sharp but obviously still very processed and you can see it like prioritizing segmentation and like
Lighting on my face and shifting colors around so I'll leave a link below if you want to watch that whole esprinter review when it goes live and you might as well subscribe over there while you're at it for other car videos but this is all part of the pixel experience just like they're they're still tuning these cameras they may end up looking a little more natural in the future even though it's been a generation like that's one of the things that you can get out of this phone but also when they
present these things it's all about the features the smarts the crazy AI magic editor and all this AI stuff on these  experience so Google makes Android Google makes their own Android phone therefore the Google Android phone should be the vessel for showing off the latest and great latest from Android right it's I mean Android 15 preview just got shown off in February it's coming out by the end of the year these phones launch with Android 14 that's not a joke all these pixel 9s
are running the second latest version of Android out the box obviously they should be first in line for 15 and then the seven years of promised software updates but that's still hilarious but every time I go back to using a pixel you know I'm reminded of all this stuff that I I miss when I use other phones like call screening so good I mean I know Samsung kind of has like a janky Bixby version of it but it doesn't work as well I've tried uh the now playing feature also that just kind of ambiently
tells you what song is playing in the background wherever you're at love it and now there's all this new stuff that they're adding that also may or may not hook people to the pixel so call notes is a new one pretty useful summarizes phone calls that you're on with a recording and the new pixel weather app originally I I wasn't gonna give that much of a chance to it but honestly it's turned out to be just as good as basically any other Android weather app I've tried so you can get to it by
tapping the weather widget on the home screen and it's got this really pretty UI where you can rearrange the big tiles and put the ones you care most about closer to the top it doesn't let you change your weather Source but I mean I'm already nitpicking at a level that only weather nerds will really care about and they also threw in an updated Panorama UI and the camera and I don't know if anybody cares about this but the temperature sensor in the pros works on people now I don't know if you caught
that and it gives these live temperature readings now as you move around an object none of which is medical advice by the way I'm actually impressed by Google's commitment to this particularly useless app like Google I know you get a lot of heat for killing things typically but I give you permission to stop working on the thermometer app I think I think you've done it but there's one thing that again if you watch watch Google's event that is really supposed to stand the pixel out from the rest of
the world of smartphones and that is because this is where Gemini lives this is this deep deep integration with Google's newest assistant here literally the bootup animation on this phone is the Google logo and then it turns into the Gemini logo before it starts up like the these are basically Gemini phones so  so ignoring the fact that Google has this horrible habit of rebranding and renaming things in the most confusing way possible it seems clear that Gemini is the thing we should be focusing on
here like there's a lot of pressure on this little Buck to be as useful as possible and it actually delivers like I have found Gemini to be very useful and also rapidly improving over the past couple weeks and gaining new cap abilities and it's still it's very conversational it remembers context it gets questions correct most of the time it's good I clearly need to do an updated assistant battle because the last one I did was with Google Assistant not Gemini but see that's the weird
thing Google introduced this huge new Gemini assistant to everyone but also Google Assistant still exists alongside Gemini on these phones too like it's it's two different assistants matter of fact for a little while Google Assistant was actually better than Gemini at a lot of things for what regular people were doing with it because Gemini couldn't set timers it couldn't get directions to places it couldn't do basic home controls and so Google Assistant would be the thing that
it would fall back on and that people would continue to use was confusing even now on the pixel 9 you can hold down the power button or swipe up from the corner to get to Gemini but the permanent pixel home screen widget on everyone's phone if you tap that microphone that's the old Google Assistant but today now Gemini can actually set timers and alarms and it can listen and tell you what song is playing in the background when it couldn't before and it can do home controls like changing my Nest
Thermostat temperature and turning smart lights on but for some weird reason when it's doing all of these new capabilities it's showing me a little Google Assistant logo in the corner as if to tell me like okay it works and we have this new capability but Gemini is doing this through the old Google Assistant which why even tell me that just do the thing so anyway then also in the settings you'll be able to have these Gemini extensions which when you enable them will let Gemini see more into your
actual life like through other apps like Google Docs and drive and your calendar and to me that's really where it becomes the the most useful like I start asking it to find emails for me and tell me the traffic to my next calendar event and things like that that is just like talking to a normal person and it's super useful but then Gemini live gets into this slightly less comfortable sometimes but also sometimes very useful fully conversational mode with Gemini so you just open it like this and it's full
screen so okay I've got this wasp nest in my studio and I need to get rid of it  wasps are pretty aggressive so getting rid of the nest safely is the priority do you know what kind of wasps are in the nest that will help me figure out the best way to help you remove it I have no idea but they're all really active all the time okay that makes sense to start it's best to try and figure out what kind of wasps you're dealing with are they yellow and black with a narrow waist if
so they're probably yellow jackets or are they more brown or gray with a wider waist those would be paper wasps you know what I don't want to get that close to them how about I just find Pest Control nearby can you do that okay so this is this is all at the mercy of your internet connection and it not hallucinating and and getting everything right but when it does it's actually it can be super useful especially when you have like a bunch of follow-up questions about something and
you want to just keep going then it's less of a bunch of typ in Google and just talk to it it's fine so I do think Gemini is actually really good at this point I will plan on doing a comparison to S the new Siri of course probably chat GPT and probably some others in some updated assistant battle feel free to get subscribed if you want to see that when it comes out but as of right now yeah I'm I'm a fan of what assistant assistant of what Gemini is doing but the thing is you can do any of this with
Gemini on any Android phone matter of fact Google literally demoed Gemini with the Galaxy S 24 Ultra at their own event like they didn't even try to hide it so if that's not unique to pixel and it's basically the Gemini phone like what's the point of all this new npu power with the tensor G4 and all this extra Ram dedicated to AI tasks what exactly is that good for well there are a bunch of other AI [Applause] tasks so here's how I want to go through these there's a bunch of new AI features
on the pixel 9's and I want to just sort of divide them into useful meh and gimmicks based on my own experience with them over the past couple weeks I've been trying them all using them putting them through their paces and I have some thoughts so some of them are really good and add to the pixel experience and others not that great kind of overrated so under useful I'm putting Gemini of course just the assistant overall it's quick it gets things right fine then I have call notes
video boost and add me so video boost actually seems to make a surprising difference at how good the video quality comes out of a pixel and what you can get out of these uh call notes is is convenient because if you have the guts to turn it on on a phone call it can record everything injust it all transcribe it summarize it and give you that after the phone call which is it's just useful and then add me add me add me is interesting it's good it works pretty well I just I'm not sure if
people are going to actually use it or if they're going to like try it once and then forget about it and go back to taking selfies but it does what it's supposed to it's right there next to the portrait mode it's easy to access in the camera and so if you need to take a group shot and you actually have no one to take it for you this feature is genuinely useful it just combines two pictures and boom everyone's now on the photo in case you were wondering yes you can do add me with yourself and yes if
you pixel peep you can tell that it's not perfect every single time there are fuzzy edges like it's clearly using the base frame from the first photo and then compositing in the last person but in general like the fact that Google has leaned this far in and created a genuinely useful feature out of thin air by just abandoning reality in the pixel camera app I guess uh yeah you got to give them credit it's just will people actually know to use this or will they just go back to taking like a selfie
with everyone behind them so they get everyone in the shot I don't know only time will tell so then there's me there's like the the okay stuff so I have uh the new weather summaries in the new weather app they're AI generated so right at the top of the app there it gives you some text to describe the day for you so you don't have to look at all those confusing numbers underneath honestly it's actually kind of useful sometimes but is this really AI like maybe the sentence structure is coming
from an L or something I I don't know whatever it's fine it certainly didn't tell me about all this clouds coming in probably going to dump some rain and also ruin my lighting but then magic editor got this reimagine feature that lets you highlight any part of an image and then enter some text to turn it into something else completely different to have your photos look like I don't know a fantasy land or something that also never happened it does outright refuse to do some of my more dramatic edits
like it doesn't seem to want to reimagine people ever but it'll happily add objects to the background or change the setting entirely if you're into that I don't know what is a photo anyway and then the last me but not least or whatever is uh the screenshots app am I missing something here I mean I get the premise you have some screenshots on your phone that you've taken where you want to save some critical information in them so they built a place where you can organize them all into collections which is
convenient you can search through them you can have it remind you at a certain date and time of a specific screenshot and even link you back to the web page that you took a screenshot of and it makes all this information searchable but I'm sitting here thinking shouldn't this have been built into Google photos like did you know that Samsung's photos app already built in the smart linking to any website you take a screenshot of I mean don't get me wrong it it works it does what it's supposed to my theory is
it's they're probably doing slightly more analysis more processing of all the bits of text and information in each photo uh than they would with the normal Google photos app so that is what enables all the indexing and everything and then maybe if it goes well they'll also bring all that to the photos app maybe or or if it doesn't go well then they can kill it easily I don't know whatever it's fine uh that's not though as bad as my gimmicks section so Zoom enhance have you heard about this
there's a new edit feature finally shipping in the photos app that encourages you to zoom all the way in on a photo and then let it do its pixel magic where it plays this whole animation like it's going to reconstruct your photo and find some hidden details uh but it it kind of never does at the end of the day all it does is sort of Turn Up The Clarity filter and maybe add what feels like some fake texture where it thinks there should have been some I'm not buying it and then there's the
pixel studio app which is just this neat little app to generate new images completely on device and again what I'm not saying is that it doesn't work it actually does work impressively well in like 3 seconds on device it can generate whatever you want it's just that I don't I guess I don't really see a real genuine use for this other than just messing around which hey I honestly that's fine too if you just want to mess around and make a a meatball sub with legs then you got it knock yourself
out so before it starts pouring rain The Meta with new smartphones in 2024 is you know slight improvements across the board but then also some splashy new AI features that are only available on the newest one because the new chip and the new neural cores and it's just special for that reason so that's that's what's happening and if you want you could easily throw these new pixels into that camp but the reason you'd buy this phone is really just the same as ever for a pixel it's the smartest smartphone
in the room and it's now also in a piece of kind of nice Hardware that's a pleasure to hold and use and then there's a bunch of AI stuff on top that you can try and either take it or leave it it's kind of just up to you if you want to get a bunch of use out of that stuff or literally never touch it at all I'm curious if you leave a comment down below below what sort of stuff you think you would use or buy the phone to use or which stuff you don't think's that useful at all at the end of the day
we'll have to see how it ages but I'm thinking pixel 9 and 9 Pro is some of their finest work yet also shout out to ankor for sponsoring this video their new Anker Prime lineup is their most advanced Multi-Device fast charger they've made yet that includes three charging stations one docking station one wall charger one power bank and one new cable so the two that stand out to me the most are the anchor Prime charging station and the anchor Prime power bank the charging station is this
desktop accessory that can kick out 250 watts in total among its four USBC and 2 usba ports and then it has a display that can show you how much power each Port is drawing actively and then it lets you customize charging priority on each Port so you can let it just sort of auto adjust and make the highest demanding items get the max charge that they can take and then the power bank "has a 9,600 Mah capacity and there's two" USBC ports on it and up to 65 watts output from this thing but it can also
be a wall charger too so that 1.3 in display is going to show you how much battery you have left and how much power each of those ports is outputting so you can check them out and the rest of the anchor Prime lineup in the video description but either way that's been it I got this in before the pouring rain started so I'm pretty proud of that but let me know what you think in the comments below talk to you guys the next one peace
