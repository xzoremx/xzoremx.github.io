all right so first thing I did when I got back from Australia was start to catch up on the stuff that I missed and I put my SIM card in the pixel fold the pixel 9 Pro fold and I was impressed really maybe I shouldn't have been so impressed given how good the other pixel 99's already are but it's a folding phone folding phones are hard but the second generation of anything tells you a lot and even though this is called the pixel 99 Pro phone F it's a second one uh the first pixel fold was last year
and it was solid it was one of my favorite foldables to use closed with that passport style aspect ratio but it had a number of trade-offs with its price this one makes some big strides forward so let me just start with the design like there was a lot of chatter about this camera bump on the back just because of the way it looks which is yeah it's kind of weird but personally this hasn't bothered me it's not like the biggest wobbler I wish it was wider like the other pixels I wish it looked
more con consistent like the pixel 9 and 9 Pro but you don't have to look at it much I'm guessing it looks like this just because of the complicated internals of a folding phone but then the rest of the design around this thing is pretty nice it is much thinner first of all and they've flattened the sides all the way around so it's this more modern like squared off shape a lot of other flagships have now the funny thing is the rounded sides from last year were actually easier to just pry open for a
folding phone so you'll notice that if you use both phones back to back but this isn't the end of the world and then there's a bunch of other refinements too the hinge is a bit smaller the sides are now uh sort of matte finish instead of glossy so now you have matte sides and a soft touch back and overall it just feels much closer to a normal slab when it's closed it's not fully there like we're not quite fooling anybody yet but it's a little over 10 mm thick folded and there are a lot of other phones from
the past year that are around that number the main change though definitely is that it's not that smaller passport size anymore this is a full-on like maxed out Flagship size 6.3 in 1080P Dynamic 120 HZ AMOLED display it's big the last one is more reachable for sure now it's much more like the OnePlus open sized so it's it's right around the maximum of actually being able to use the whole screen with one hand I mean your mileage may vary of course depending on the size of your hands but
yeah there's also still real bezels all the way around the screen and it kind of pushes it away from the hinge so it's a off center but in general I still find it very usable and it just feels more like a regular phone than ever before which I think is a win I really like this cover screen and then when you open it up that's when the benefits of being taller really start to pay off cuz now you go from a 7.6 in screen to a slightly narrower but taller 8 in screen that's basically now a square and the
screen is way better it's up to 2700 nits it's nice and bright it is actually ltpo when the cover screen is not for some reason and the bezels have tremendously improved from the first folding pixel so they're still a little thick sure but now they're nicely even all the way around and there's a hole punch cut out in the corner now instead of the selfie camera on the thick bezel and just look how thin that is like it's barely thicker than the USBC Port this this would have been a crazy sentence just a
few short years ago but using this phone I I wager almost everything about the hardware of this Google phone is at or above average which it's crazy it's like the harder the part is to make the the better and more above average they are like this new hinge is nice and smooth and the phone opens and closes in a really satisfying way and it unfolds all the way flat easily unlike last year's phone the crease through the middle is you know average at worst but very easy to look past when you're actually
looking that content on the screen and uh they fit in a 4650 mAh battery inside which again is a little above average for foldables even though it's actually slightly less than last year the speakers in this thin body are very good and full uh the water resistance is here it's ipx8 the flatter fingerprint reader is easy and quick and fast and just this Hardware feels actually more deserving of the word Pro than ever before so you know they renamed the phone it has Pro in the name now but feels like it
deserves it but also little things like the outer display not being ltpo feel weird considering that's the one that does the always on thing that's the one you really want to be ltpo and it also doesn't charge particularly fast and there's no ch2 so the phone has this lower than normal wireless charging coil that can be kind of annoying to line up and doesn't work on certain Chargers which may feel like nitpicking but hey "when it's an $1,800 phone you are" definitely allowed to nitpick overall
though design- wise I really feel like they got a lot of stuff right so yeah it reminds me of the OnePlus open from last year which won my best folding phone of the year but then this one is a pixel and this pixel software experience ends up being what differentiates it over a lot of other folding phone options out there because yeah there are totally more flashy foldables with more advanced Hardware from Vivo and xiaomi and there's these razor thin pieces of Hardware with head turning specs but if
I'm being honest the software on those typically isn't nearly as good so here you basically have all the same features as the rest of the pixel 9 Flagship lineup which is great it's it's call screening it's the the pixel weather app it's all the new stuff basically everything except the thermometer app and that's fine so Gemini is actually getting good like I said in the nine review and I'm Still Loving Circle to search although on this inner screen you got to be slightly more careful because
the slight difference between hold to Circle to search and the tiny swipe to bring up the dock can kind of take some getting used to but then there's also all the foldable optimizations the two column layouts for so many pieces of Android the notification the settings app so many other first party apps and I've just been generally loving the larger size screen because it feels like multitasking and having multiple apps open at once or specifically something I do a lot which
is picture in picture with a small YouTube video window somewhere on the screen but I'm reading an article or doing something else in a full-size window all of that is better on this phone than last year and this is all Android 14 which is the same as all the other new pixels but I put Android 15 beta on my old pixel fold and there are some more folding optimizations it's just it's hopefully coming soon and they promise seven years of software updates on Pixel 9 which is pretty Elite so I've
said a lot of nice things about this phone but going into this before I even put my SIM card in it because I'd read other people's coverage and seen stuff about this phone is I knew that there would be basically two main downsides to look out for to keep an eye on and those are the tensor chip being underpowered and the downgraded camera system so okay it's a pixel so let's just start with the cameras basically my findings are yes they are smaller sensors than the main pixels and yes they are worse but
they're not horrible like they're not that much worse that it's a bad camera now basically you can see the style of the photos is the same and it's it's contrasty it's high dynamic range but it's not as sharp is my main observation and this gets exaggerated as the conditions get worse so in lower light the photos get softer and lack details faster as these smaller sensors start to fight for light more so it feels on par with like a pixel Flagship but from a few years ago like a pixel 7 Pro now
that's about it and that's always been one of the compromises of these high-end folding phones is you know they give you all the software features of the other "phones but for ,7 $1,800 you would also" hope for the maximum quality but they can't fit all of the same camera sensors in a phone that has all this other hardware and a hinge and everything like that so if you take a lot of pictures and you're into phones spe specifically for that that might be a tough pill to
swallow but if you're not if you buy it for other reasons and you're not a huge camer person then you may be willing to overlook that me personally I rely too much on photos and videos for my phone so that's tough for me but the other downside is this tensor chip and this is another nuanced one see Google's tensor chip has never been best in its class power-wise or efficiency wise I'd argue it's been good enough for the phones it's been in but if you wanted to do like high-end gaming or if you wanted a
really extended shelf life for more than a few years or really amazing battery life like tensor is holding these phones back and so people have been trying to figure out all right when is Google going to catch up and get on par with like the Qualcomm level Flagship chips and the tensor G4 in the pixel 9 line of phones including this phone is solid and it's paired with 16 gigs of ram in this phone which is awesome and obviously helps with the AI models but also running the rest of the phone but it's
not not amazing and it really makes you wonder like okay it's promised seven years of software updates but will the phone last that long like these are real questions but word on the street is next gen next tensor chip allegedly maybe is going to be the one that finally goes from being designed by Google and manufactured by Samsung to the first fully custom Google chip with 3 nanometers and everything and that could be the huge jump that this needs that could be a big Power jump a big
efficiency jump but that's just a rumor so I would say that if you hear that and get excited about that which let's be honest a lot of the customer base for a "$2,000 folding phone actually does care" about that stuff then you should probably wait I actually feel like you should wait and this is it's weird to say that this is both one of the best folding phones I've ever used and you should probably wait just because you don't want to spend this much and then regret your purchase next year but if
that doesn't speak to you honestly this phone as it exists today it feels great it looks great it's smooth the battery life for me is consistently like 6 hours of screen on time with mostly small screen activities but then the sort of 10% of the time that I actually open it and do a lot more big screen use then you can eat into the battery a bit more but I just feel like I am productive when I have this phone like it really does accomplish the goal of feeling like I have two phones the regular siiz
Flagship when it's close closed and then the mini tablet ready to go at any time for the multicolumn layouts the multitasking and big productivity apps for all that stuff that I really sit down and get stuff done on my phone for this thing has been awesome oh and also speaking of ready to go at any time I just wanted to shout out that the new Ridge wallet that I designed is finally here and it is a full grain leather soft wallet and it's sick RFID blocking lightweight two pockets with easy access
you can kind of just pop them up from the front front or use your finger to Glide them up from the back fits up to around eight cards you could put cash in it if you want to also it's everything you need and nothing you don't I'll link it below if you want to check it out I'm really proud of it but yeah look if you're not a foldable person then this phone may not convince you like it's the same dimensions the same functionality roughly like it's not a game changer by any means but if you are a foldable
person this phone has been awesome to use like I've really enjoyed the fact that it really feels like a full-on Flagship on the front and feels like a mini tablet when I want one two phones in one that's the ideal foldable phone for me and uh yeah this is my favorite Flagship foldable ever to come out so there you have it hopefully Android 15 soon thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace
