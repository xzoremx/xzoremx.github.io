all right yall have waited patiently for this once again this year we've run our blind smartphone camera test scientific style you know we always think we know what the absolute best smartphone cameras are but do we actually know like what if we wanted an objective answer straight from Real World data literally every time I review a phone there's some people in the comment section saying oh I you know iPhone photos are the only good ones or I only like pixel photos or you know Samsung is the only one who
does good portrait mode but what if we put that to the test what if we took a bunch of the best smartphone cameras on the planet and took them out into the real world and took the exact same photo with each and every one of them and then strip them of all their labels and then had you the public vote on which one's photos you like the best that should reveal the best actual smartphone camera so that's exactly what we did this year we took these 20 smartphones updated all
of their software charged them all up got their batteries to 100% then we went out and took this same three photos with each one one daytime photo one low light photo and one portrait mode photo yes it is surprisingly hard to stay perfectly still for 20 identical photos to be taken in a row but I did it for you then we had to go in and import all the photos from every single smartphone camera Harder Than You Think strip them of all their exf data and then upload them to a site that we've built that
lets us put them side by side for you guys to vote on head-to-heads millions and millions and millions of times which you did that should give us a statistically significant winner and loser we'll get to that and the results this year were kind of interesting a little bit I almost didn't make this video but I can tell people have been waiting the competitive tension is high and the actual results might be a little surprising to some of you so let's get into it so the data our site spits out
all comes in these text files with matchup ratings for every single combination of smartphones we actually had them coded by letters of the alphabet you can see a through T but that little number number that one right here is the most important that is the ELO rating you know the system that ranks chess players or tennis players basically anything head-to-head with enough matchup information we can sort of sort through all these letters based on who they beat and who they lose to
and creative Power Rankings and that will give us our winners so the question you probably all want to know who were the winners and so we'll go we'll go category by category because like I said there were three different scenarios daytime low light and portrait mode so let's go one by one so daytime for the regular daylight photos we kind of had it set up with just me sitting in front of this window here but there's a lot to this photo the strongest light is from inside the room but then the window
light is actually a good test of dynamic range and then there's also a variety of colors there's my skin tone there's the orange chair next to the blue Pillow a few other things this is on purpose there's no individual variable that can dominate this test so every single phone we try to frame the exact same way way from the exact same spot holding one of them up as a reference so we can get as close as possible and everything is fully auto we just open the camera app make sure the lens is clean and just hit
the shutter button we don't even tap to focus just point and shoot it takes about 6 minutes to go through all 20 phones like I said it's kind of hard to sit still for 6 minutes straight but we did it so for this regular daylight photo situation the winner with the highest ELO rating is the pixel 7A that's pretty impressive so this this is the photo that you guys for the most part voted as the winner in most of its matchups pretty neutral photo to be honest not too bright not too dark
pretty excellent dynamic range and it's also not a fluke because the second highest ELO rating came from the pixel fold so the fold took a very similar photo and then finishing up on the podium was the OnePlus open one of those high-end folding phones so I will say my personal favorite photo and the one that actually won for me when I blind tested myself was this one this is the fourth highest ELO rating this is the OnePlus 11 it's definitely a little on the contras your side but a little more
confident with nailing the exposure and having dynamic range nevertheless it's definitely interesting here a lot of people pointed out that the sun behind me you know looked a little different in each photo it might have been setting so the background was a little different which is a little bit true but it wasn't late enough in the day for that to actually affect the photo I think the fact that the 7A is the only one with this little lens flare is actually just a coincidence and then fun fact in dead
last with the absolute bottom lowest ELO rating for this daytime photo is the iPhone 15 Pro not a terrible photo I mean you can't really get a horrible photo in normal looking lighting for most of the smartphones but when you put it up against the others it's mostly just the darkest one and so when you put it up side by side against these much brighter photos people just picked the brighter one almost every single time funnily enough though you can absolutely overexpose for this
competition as the second lowest ELO rating belongs to the Galaxy s23 Ultra for producing this weirdly Overexposed Masterpiece so here are all the photos side by side with their ELO ratings feel free to pause it if you'd like to make some more observations but let's move on to the nighttime photos so low light low light is a much more challenging shot for a smartphone camera especially with a tiny sensor and Tiny Optics trying to take in as much light as possible but you know computational photography has
come a long way and even in this pretty dark rooftop where the only light source was like 40 ft away from me these cameras still manag to do a good job and if you're ready for the plot twist the highest overall ELO rating for the low light photo comes from dead last from the daylight photo it is again the iPhone 15 Pro with another totally reasonable photo now following it very closely in second place was the pixel 8 Pro and actually the pixel 7A coming in third and to be honest I fully agree
with all of these it's kind of it's starting to get ridiculous how much some of the other smartphone cameras started to pump up the light like literally the second you get outside the top four you get straight into bad HDR territory like this is the this is the fifth place photo from s23 Ultra which is definitely too bright and also you can see this little HDR haloe effects starting to show up around my head and then if you scroll all the way down to the Oppo X6 Pro just my God what happened like these
cameras are going nuts it looks like in this one they literally painted sloppily over me and just dragged up the exposure matter of fact yep see that's exactly what it looks like the Zen phone did this too along with a few others and I honestly think the OnePlus open not only made me brighter but then it also identified the sky and made the sky darker which just then starts to look look ridiculous I mean real life looked nothing like this so here are all the nighttime photos and
their ELO ratings pause it if you need it and now we can move to the last but not least category portrait mode so portrait mode kind of turns out to be the hardest test like this to run because they all kind of do portrait mode a little bit differently if you just open the camera app and switch to portrait mode some of them do 2x some of them are 3x some of them say 1X but they're actually like 1.5x it's kind of weird so we tried to just keep it simple for this test and just open the camera
app switch to portrait mode and then move our feet forward or backward to try to match the focal length with all of these shots it kind of worked and you know they all kind of also have different Boca levels some of them are adjustable some of them aren't but like I said we're just going with the default the point and shoot that most people will get when they do it and the portrait mode point and shoot winner with the highest ELO rating is the pixel 8 Pro this was followed pretty closely
by Samsung Z fold 5 which I actually think had a better cutout and then the Third highest ELO here was the iPhone 15 Pro which I think had the most natural looking blur but basically all of these Podium finishers have relatively subtle portrait modes nothing too dramatic and then pretty good detail and overall balance in just the rest of the photo I say this because the losers here in this particular category were nothing like this they were some of the wonkiest weirdest photos in the entire
competition and the loser with the absolute lowest ELO rating for this category and actually in any category was the Sony Xperia 1 Mark 5 with this photo with that that's the photo like okay this this one looks like a mistake we all actually thought it was a mistake as we shot it like this can't possibly be right right we clean the lens we take it again it does it again and then it did it again and again so I mean I guess "for whatever reason this $1,200 Android" flagship phone in its Auto Port portrait
mode just could not handle this lighting it had some weird issues anyway here's all of the portrait mode photos and their ELO ratings you're welcome I'd like to give out some awards now that we have all of our matchup data and all of our voting and all of our ELO ratings from across every single person for what you guys voted for for more than 20 million total votes there's some pretty interesting stuff here so we have our winners and losers in each of the three categories which is cool but if you
average it all together we have have the highest overall average ELO rating we'll call this one the people's champ and with the highest average of 1660 that's pretty competitive it was the pixel 7A so this one won the daytime photo as you probably remember but then it also came in third place in the nighttime photo and fourth place of all 20 in the portrait mode photo so that's pretty strong but here's the kicker the second highest average ELO rating was the pixel 8 Pro and the third
highest average ELO rating again this is your votes is the pixel fold so pixel pixel pixel it's a perfect pixel Podium so here you can see the whole list from top to bottom the three pixels at the top surprisingly in Reverse price order and then bringing up the rear for total ELO is the Sony xer 1 Mark 5 and the xiaomi 13 Ultra then I also had to bring back the bang for the buck award which I did this last year also it's basically just most votes from you guys divided by MSRP
at launch so most votes per dollar basically and so your winner again is going to be the pixel 7A this was a phone that launched right around 500 bucks it did incredible on the tests but in second place in votes per dollar is the nothing phone 2 it's a pretty good performing phone and it actually launched like upper mid-range price so this is a good phone bang for the buck wise and then in 3A 3B right next to each other under underneath these two you have the OnePlus 11 and the zenphone
10 and then impressively actually the Sony is not dead last in this category it is expensive and it did perform horribly but not worse bang for the buck wise than a super expensive folding phone the Z flip 5 overall average uh did worse for the dollar the more you know so what did we learn with all this well I'll leave you with this first of all the pixels killed it they had the 123 finish they're great bang for the buck it was weird that they're in RSE price order but fine but also there's a
lot more to a smartphone camera of course than just a sitting down staged photo of a person we learned a little bit about how it shoots my skin tones there's a whole bunch of other things you might care about from autofocus speed to the UI to the actual file format how editable it is to videos like there's a there's a bunch more to it but at the end of the day I think we were still pretty not shocked by the slightly brighter photos being the slightly less bright photos and maybe we'll run it back again next
year and learn something new either way thanks for watching this one catch you guys next time peace
