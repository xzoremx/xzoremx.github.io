all right welcome to the smartphone Awards 2024 every year dozens and dozens of smartphones come out and this is one of the most highly anticipated videos of the Year where we get to reward and highlight some of the absolute best of them and some of the worst so we have 10 categories to go through tonight each one of of them may have potentially some Runner UPS or some honorable mentions depending on if they deserve it of course but then every category will have its overall winner and every overall
winner will get a custom trophy that we've made like usual so if you are a tech company watching this and you win a trophy reach out let me know I can send you the trophy so there are a lot of phones on this desk in front of me from all different manufacturers some of them flagships some of them cheap some of them big some of them small some of them easy to get some of them hard to get but they all have one thing in common which is they all came out during this calendar year of
2024 so let's give out some awards so the first category best big phone so the idea behind this category was to sort of separate smaller phones and then the bigger phones and then reward the absolute best big phones but the thing about phones these days is they're all kind of big now like phones are just getting bigger so I'm going to try to reward the absolute biggest ones and the ones that make the most use of having a little bit of extra space so like here's an example the Rog phone 9 this came out
late in the calendar year but because it's a gaming phone they sort of Target all the things that make it good at gaming and they also happen to make it a great regular phone huge 6.8 in screen also huge speakers also huge battery it's great for regular phones it even has a headphone jack but it's not perfect you know nothing's perfect but one got really really close this year and that's the Vivo X200 Pro again a phone to come out late in the calendar year but they basically did everything
with this phone you can see the huge camera bump there's some incredible camera Hardware in here another huge screen but one phone did outdo it there was one big phone that kind of nailed everything about being a big phone and that's the winner which is the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra Samsung has got this formula down to a science they have made a really good use of space in the Ultra Series of phones for years now really nice screen probably one of the best in any smartphone also with this really
good anti-reflective coating that kind of went under the radar but is really good on this phone really good cameras on the back without protruding too much it also has a huge battery while still having a stylus down there there's just a lot going on in this phone and all the software to back it up plus it recently started getting this one UI 7 beta which jumps it to Android 15 it's getting software updates just a lot of good things going on with this phone it's skewed with these Awards sometimes to be
the phones that came out later in the year this came out in January still deserves the award so then next category best small phone this is kind of a sad one actually this year because while like you've seen lots of phones have been getting bigger and bigger the small phones usually would pull up the rear there'd be a couple small phones that sort of float around and deliver that special experience for people who want a flagship but that's not huge the mini iPhones and the Zen phones of the world
uh but those are all dead now so then what's left could be the best small phone among all the stuff that we saw come out this year here think about this the Samsung Galaxy s24 came out earlier this year right it's not that big of a phone it's a 6.2 in display it's the smallest Flagship that they made 6.2in screen is bigger than the phone that won the best big phone 10 years ago which was the 5.7in Galaxy Note 4 so that just shows you how crazy it's gotten you know there's the Vivo X200 mini also came out
that was still over 6 in really good phone for that size and I also considered the flipping phones every year they're they're appealing as small phones but then you open them up and they're huge again ultimately what I settled on was the iPhone 16 best small phone 2024 so the iPhone 16 is rocking a 6.1 in display note that it's the same body size as the iPhone 16 Pro but with a slightly smaller screen but I really like the way that Apple stepped up the Basse phones this year
they have really good cameras really good battery life Flagship chip performance years of software updates more RAM than the Basse phones I've ever had and yeah I could have given this to the 16 Pro because of how mad I am personally about the lack of higher fresh rate but everything else about the base iPhone feels as close to the flagship as it's ever been and I even prefer things like the matte rails and the real variety of colors they've just done a really good job with the iPhone
16 so in this world of so many phones being so gigantic and trying to pack as as much as possible into a huge phone and being a two-handed phone shout out to the couple of one-handed phones still left so then that brings us to our next category of the night best camera so things are always interesting in the camera space for a couple of reasons number one obviously the hardware just keeps getting better and better year after year better Periscope cameras bigger sensors all the Optics improve
but also this year especially we've just seen a ton of AI stuff everyone is expected to have some AI especially in their cameras whether it's AI scene recognition or AI portrait mode or AI background object removal whatever it is there's got to be AI in just about every camera so in that way I I can definitely say that my criteria for best camera has moved around a bit and this feels like one of the most competitive years ever for cameras you know the pixel we didn't do the blind camera test this year but I
suspect it would have done really well again they still have that look to them and the Galaxy s24 Ultra is just consistently so good at photos and videos for Android phones every year but one really stood out to me this year and again it came out late during the calendar year but the Vivo X200 Pro man if you haven't heard about this phone this has got some serious camera hardware and the reason it stood out to me is because it feels like it comes the closest to an actual real camera
shooting experience and results out of anything on this table so Hardware Wise It's already high-end it's got a really big 50 megapixel main sensor it also has a large 50 megapixel Ultra wide and it has a 200 megapixel sensor behind that Periscope zoom lens as well the shots that come from it have this great natural depth of field as well the camera app is quick and full of options and the super high resolution on that telephoto lens means that it can go from the 3.7x optical way way in and still
maintain sharpness even without doing the s24 Ultra dual telephoto thing plus I had a lot of fun playing with the portrait lens looks built in which can shape and stylize the bokeh in a way that's really convincing even if the subject cutouts aren't perfect but it didn't win my award this year look I'm just as tired of it as you guys are but if you had to take just one smartphone from this table from this year to take all of your photos and videos The Choice is still the iPhone 16 Pro the streak
continues and yeah I hate them winning every year just as much as an next person but look ask anyone who shoots and relies on videos and photos from their smartphone regularly what they would use and the answer just keeps coming back iPhone 16 Pro obviously it's easy to shoot with it's simple and it's reliable over and over again it produces that similar look and they added a lot of specific features this year to dialing in that look so you have all these new manual controls you have all
these formats that you can shoot in and the video is consistently unparalleled from the 4K 30 and the autofocus to the super stabilized video to the super slow-mo video I I honestly want another smartphone to come along and knock it off its post and I think we're closer than ever to that but for right now iPhone's still the truth in the camera Department next category best value every year this is the most interesting and competitive category because there are so many options that come out in the
value budget space even some that are not on this table in front of me uh that are super competitive and all have different things that they prioritize and at different price points and that's always the question about value isn't it what what price point are we going to have that qualifies it as a as a value phone is it should just be anything under 500 bucks or anything under 400 maybe that makes more sense or maybe it should just be anything that just has the absolute max value for the price
that you can shove in a phone even if it is a flagship and that's actually what I'm doing the fact is it's just harder though for a more expensive phone to actually deliver on much more value the classic law of diminishing returns how can an $800 phone give you twice as much value as a $400 phone it just can't so you know redmi every year has a ton of really competitive options also it seems like Poco is always churning out at every single price point they possibly can but what stood out to me this year I
do want to give a shout out to the pixel 8A it came out at 500 bucks and has a really good camera system in this price range but it did kind of feel like it was clashing a little bit with the pixel 8 but also the cmf phone one came out this year and this was a $200 phone that delivered a lot of value in a bunch of ways but also in just fun and modularity and accessibilities and and this unique design and you don't see a lot of you don't see any really other I guess one
other Orange phone on this desk but this is a really interesting phone to come out and was actually easy to recommend so 200 bucks it gets a shout out for sure but my winner for best value for 2024 that's going to go to the nothing phone 2A so this phone launched at $350 it gave you a big bright 120 HZ screen with uniform bezels all the way around "that's rare check Flagship size 5,000" mAh battery with 45 W charging check a serviceable 50 megapixel main Camera Plus an ultra wide if you need it check
under display fingerprint reader you know it didn't Benchmark super high but their performance has always been really smooth they do a great job optimizing their software and then of course the glyphs on the back however you feel about those this is just one of those phones that costs way less than all the other flagships here but as you use it at least as I used it it consistently feels as smooth as and as well thought out as any other Flagship especially with the smoothness of the software so a
big shout out to them for that it keeps getting software updates I hope it gets way more nothing phone 2A impressive value 2024 there's your champ so then next category best battery there's been a lot more phones pushing the battery limits this year and you know this award is is is just for battery experience overall which includes battery life so I can't help but notice when there's way more "55500 6,000 mlia batteries in these big" flagships that I've seen in a long time
but it's not purely just the biggest battery capacity that's going to win you my award for this I'm not just going to "give this to the 28,000 milliamp" Energizer phone that does exist every every year it's crazy it's just peace of mind right long battery life is one thing but then lots of good battery maintenance features convenient fast charging is another thing like the big iPhones come out every year and they have really good battery life but they just charge too slow so the Samsung
Galaxy s24 Ultra comes out this year has "a 5,000 mAh battery with room for the" stylus as well it also has 45 watt Peak charging and wireless charging and it just seemed to last forever like this is a phone you could use all day easily with this big bright screen but that wasn't enough that wasn't enough there was almost a subcategory of what I would consider like Mega flagships that came out this year that sort of took things to the next level Oppo Find X8 Pro again a late addition to the calendar
"5,900 mAh battery and also 80 watts of" peak charging so this can go 0 to 100 in a little under an hour it also could do 50 watt Wireless charging with the right air vuk charging pad it's ridiculous still wasn't enough the Vivo X200 Pro "also came out this year had a 6,000 mAh" battery and 90 watt charging still wasn't enough because there is one phone that crossed my desk this year again pretty late that had two things that I hadn't really seen much at all during the calendar year which was the new
"Snapdragon 8 Elite Chip and A 7,000 mamp" battery that's your winner which is the red magic 10 Pro this is a gaming phone and it is entirely designed around gaming with things like an exposed active fan that sacrifices water resistance for spinning up and keeping it cool when it's gaming and charging but the Snapdragon 8 Elite ship has been like a superpower in a couple of phones that it started to show up in late this year there's a couple other phones that have it but it has been dramatically
more efficient than the previous generation which we love seeing so it has that chip maybe leave a thumbs up if you want to see a video just about the Snapdragon 8 Elite but then it also has "a 7,50 mAh battery and so just that" combo alone makes this a 2-day phone comfortably at 144 HZ which is sick you could also turn it down to 60 HZ and do even better than that if you want and when you do have to charge it up it'll go zero to 100 in half an hour or so because it charges out 100 watts of peak
charging so it's just got a lot going for it it also has all the battery maintenance features you can cap it at 80% charging if you want it's also got bypass charging to avoid thermal damage there's just a lot in the battery Department red magic 10 Pro battery champ 20124 so our next category is the best design if you hang out in the YouTube comments section long enough you'll read things like smartphones are just kind of boring these days like they're all the same as last year have
we reached Peak smartphone is nothing different anymore and if you agree with that you kind of have to ignore some of the most interesting stuff happening around the edges some of the most Innovative and fascinating design choices that we've seen in a long time worth honoring a little bit in 2024 the cmf phone 1 that I talked about earlier this is one of those great examples a super budget phone that tries to Stand Out by doing something a little bit different design like a fun design being the reason you
buy this $200 budget phone over others I actually think from its Big Brother company the nothing phone 2A did a lot of similar things it's uh the glyph design on the back the transparent stuff they had some special editions they thought a lot about design in this phone and connected it to the software which I think is really cool but when I'm giving a design award I also I I don't want to give it to anything that had a critical flaw like I want to give it to someone that just definitely didn't do anything
wrong like s24 or pixel 9 but that would be boring so my design Award winner for 2024 is the Huawei mate XT AKA the trifold look you guys have seen the video on this phone there were some rumors now about it maybe not being super durable honestly probably true there is articles about maybe some bad press being covered up because it's Huawei and this phone's coming straight out of China and they want to kind of cover that probably true but the fact that a real smartphone company had the
audacity to not just build a bunch of these but build a lot of them and ship them all and actually build features around them that actually works I actually remember reading those articles about you know the the Spy shots of the CEO of Huawei using this unique triple folding thing on a plane and I remember thinking okay yeah but that's he knows he's being photographed he's that's not a real phone they did not only did they actually do it but this is a crazy impressive phone it's super thin it has
the hinges it has the battery distributed through everything it's got the cameras on the back they've got software features that work with both two and three panels there's just so much going for it I can't not I can't not give this the award very deserving of the design award for 2024 so then next category conveniently best foldable so we added this new category last year just because it it was becoming more clear than ever that foldables were first of all more plentiful than ever
before there's more options than ever before and it feels like they're here to stay at least for a while so let's reward the good ones and you know at the beginning of the whole foldables category it was kind of all Samsung like they had that early lead because they dove in so early and you know they still make the zold 6 and it's a solid phone but I I wouldn't say they're holding the torch anymore I would actually say this phone right here this is the honor magic V3 this is kind
of the mantle right now for best overall foldable Hardware there's so much good about this Hardware I mean it's extremely thin it feels Flagship from the lack of a crease inside to how much battery and how much camera they fit in this phone really really sturdy hinge this a great really solid piece there's also the triple fold you know that's a crazy design as we already know but I'm giving the award for best foldable of 2024 to the pixel 9 Pro fold I really like what Google did with the design and
the hardware and the software of the second ever folding pixel you know they did change a lot and it is still very usable while closed but they trimmed up all the dimensions they flattened the sides they improved the hinge the cameras are all better and it feels among the world of folding Android phones that we have right now like the most polished at least there's a lot of good Android stuff going on to take advantage of the folding screen like if you force me to use a folding phone
right now as much as I would want the hardware of the honor I would pick the pixel fold and I I came close to dailying this phone for quite a while in this year really big fan of this phone and if you've got to have a flip because the flipping thing is different from the folding thing I would still say Samsung carries a torch there as well so little shout out to the Z flip 6 no trophy for you sorry but shout out to the pixel9 pro fold so next category one that's been here again for all 10 of these is
the most improved award so most improved year-over-year my first thought when putting this category together was this might be the hardest one to give out this year like what really stood out as the biggest Delta the biggest change a lot of times it's one that actually went wrong the previous year and sort of rided the ship or maybe took a big leap in something that was bad the previous year but what what really had the biggest change from its previous year I mean you have the Oppo Find X8 Pro which okay
much brighter screen this year they've got improved cameras this new back is really nice and also it's got the new chipset and the new software and it's a little more squared up that's nice I don't know if it's going to win most improved though and actually for the first time in a while the base iPhones were in consideration for this one the iPhone 16 this this generation did the most relative to the previous bass iPhone to get it close to the pros that we've ever seen and that's good for us
like more RAM great chipset improved cameras and the new layout and obviously it has the camera control button that the pros have but it also isn't that much better I think it's pretty clear though the most improved smartphone over last year's version yeah that is definitely the pixel 9 Pro fold the foldable pixel was something we wanted for a long time and the first pixel fold last year was a cool idea right like we all wanted to see it and Google finally delivered it
but if we're being honest with ourselves it didn't really excel in any way with the hardware especially like it was cool seeing Android could improve and handle the bigger screen on the inside but I mean that thing had some pretty thick bezels in there it didn't even fold flat I'm going to say that again it didn't even fold flat so the second generation pixel fold here represents a glow up in every single way like every every square millim of this got better I think a lot
of us were expecting to see a second generation OnePlus foldable but they just didn't make it but this is kind of the closest I think we could see to that much better cameras much better thinner hinge the whole thing is skinnier the bezels on the inside are much better it folds flat there's less crease the outside screen is better it's brighter everything is better so just from inside to outside well done Google well done so the next award is going to go to the bust of the year year so okay this is
this is a weird one this is the award you hate to have to give but I give it every year anyway to a phone that gets a shout out for how badly things went but this is a little different from previous years and you'll see why I'm going just jump right into it I'm giving the bus of the Year award to the Asus zenphone 11 Ultra you get a big red trophy for this one Asus the 11 Ultra did not win anybody's favorite phone now if it's any consolation this is the first here that I'm giving this award to
a phone that's not actually that bad of a phone it's fine this it's a okay phone if you bought it I'm sure you'd be okay with it but the point is it's it's more representative of the whole category because the Zen phones that came before this Zen phone well you remember them right those were actually really interesting phones they won previous Awards they took up some space in our heads as smartphone enthusiasts where they were actually giving us what we said we wanted which was a flagship
phone that was actually small that was one handable that fit everything we wanted into a compact size and then they just turned it into this just another generic big phone it's it's fine but we lost something today with this end phone it's gotten to the point where I genuinely don't know if we're going to keep giving out a best small phone award like phones have like I said gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and I gave you that stat earlier about how the small phones are all bigger than the big
phones used to be so does that do that mean we're going to be giving out a best small phone award to a 6 and 1/2 in screen phone in a year or two just doesn't feel right but maybe by that time phones will be even bigger and it'll feel like a small phone I don't know I haven't decided yet maybe your comments will help me but this is a bus of the year so our 10th and final category in the 10th year of the awards it's the MVP phone of the year there's a lot of choice this always feels like the
highest pressure award it's also my favorite just because what phone do I choose to carry the torch to sort of represent the entire year in smartphones with all that we've just talked about with all the exciting features and the Risk Takers and the comeback stories and the bust of the year and all this stuff which phone gets the award and I think my philosophy here is I am rewarding overall greatness so there are a couple runner-ups here that absolutely deserve real Spotlight for a minute Vivo X200
Pro especially so like I didn't even review this phone but again it came out late this year and this phone this is like God it all territory it's got the awesome super bright screen it's got the great chipset it's got these incredible cameras and that shooting experience great battery life super fast charging what doesn't it have maybe just the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip at this point although it does have a pretty great mediate Tech chip that's no slouch and that enables a lot of its features but
in general you're in can't really go wrong territory here but I keep you know I'm looking around there's some other really good ones here and I can't help but look over back at the pixel 9 Pro fold from being such a big comeback story for the pixel fold series and being such a good phone a foldable that I would actually daily to this day and doing so many things right this feels like I should highlight it so here we are but it didn't win you know what else feels worth highlighting though this was
the year of the Bas iPhone especially getting way more praise than the pro iPhones this was the most complete bass iPhone ever made it's getting Apple intelligence and all that but it also got more RAM new colors I like the matte rails this was a really good year for "not spending $1,500 on an iPhone but" also in these smartphone Awards I typically want to give a shout out to the phone that I am currently daily driving I could use basically any phone so maybe that means something to you and
so that would be this one this is the pixel9 pro XL that is kind of dinged up and scratched but this is the phone I use I use the XL over the smaller one just because the extra battery life but it didn't win we're rewarding greatness here the MVP for 2024 is a Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra this phone is just so good at everything literally everything I don't know how many of you are golfers but let me just make a quick analogy this phone is 2024 Scotty sheffler how is he so good at
everything he's an incredibly long driver but he's also one of the most accurate drivers on tour he also leads te to Green Strokes gained he's also making every putt inside 10t he has the short game how is he so good at everything but that's this phone it's kind of boring actually and I think a lot of golf fans will appreciate that so is Scotty kind of but that's the point is it's it's not making a ton of headlines for any one flashy thing or any one bad thing it's just so good so
if you want to reward a single phone with a great screen a great chip a great battery great cameras great software great support great durability even the anti-reflective coding on the screen is way above average even the vibration motor is good even the speakers are good and I don't even use the stylus so this this is the phone that I actually used the most during 2024 and I think probably of the last six seven eight years of reviewing smartphones this is the phone that I've come back to after
reviewing A phone more than any other I think I use this phone for like 9 months out of the year which doesn't sound like that much but for me that's a long time uh this phone it just does everything right it deserves this award it might not be the flashiest it might be the most boring Choice here but I fully think it deserves it this one carries the torch I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel but s24 Ultra that's her phone of the year and with that thank you for 10 years of the smartphone
Awards I don't get to do this that for 10 years without you guys obviously the support and you watching means everything and it's it's kind of the greatest job ever getting to test all these different phones and review them all and give my honest feedback and thoughts on them and to have that actually count for something so it's motivating to me to want to make the next one even better than ever before so 10 down 10 more to go maybe catch you guys in the next one  m
