all right so I've been using the new M4 iPad Pro for like 2 weeks now been doing a lot of the same stuff I did with my M1 iPad Pro from 3 years ago watching YouTube videos browsing the internet answering emails listening to music and spoiler alert it's almost exactly the same experience the M1 iPad Pro was already super overpowered and very smooth and snappy and had great battery life and this one now even more so of all the same stuff not a very helpful review I know but
I've also been thinking about some of the really interesting decisions that Apple made with this iPad specifically some stuff that wasn't like even really in the rumor Mills it kind of just came up didn't even show up in the keynote but is unusual and different so these are five of the most interesting choices that Apple made with the iPad Pro so first of all the new iPad Pro is thinner we all knew that it was already an interesting decision because I kind of felt like we were done with that a few
iterations ago like nobody was asking for thinner iPads but maybe they saw all the gushing over Samsung's Galaxy Tab Ultra guilty that thing is also ridiculously impossibly thin so iPad goes from 6.4 mm which was slightly thicker than Samsung's flagship to now 5.1 mm which just barely beats Samsung's number now you know I'm not trying to start any beef that doesn't already exist you know I'm sure if you ask Apple they'll just say look it's the thinnest Apple product ever which is already nuts
it's crazy thin but I think it really feels like apple was just looking for something to make this different to make it feel different from the last couple of generations of iPad and now there's rumors that they may also be doing this to next year's iPhone just going with thinness honestly it is noticeably thinner and lighter to me someone who's held the previous one quite a bit definitely less of a difference when you have a case on it but this is also going to naturally mean there's less room
inside the iPad but weirdly somehow the 11-in iPad Pro M4 has a larger battery than the last generation 11-in iPad Pro and this new bigger 13in has like a tiny bit slightly smaller battery almost the same size battery as last year and so what you end up with is a really good battery life again awesome standby time really good battery when you're actually using it but what strikes me is Apple could have made if they made this the same thickness as last year they could have made an iPad with an enormous
battery life with the efficiency of the M4 chip it could have had some insane long battery or they could make something strikingly thin and have the same Rock Solid battery life as always but I would have loved to have seen option one but anyway there's also a few other things missing from this tablet as well so they avoided saying it during the keynote but they got rid of the ultrawide camera not a huge deal at all obviously they kind of have a huge cutout for the light r on
the camera squares it's still kind of looks like it's maybe a dual or triple camera setup but nope single camera lar and a Flash and I was also curious if magnet paper could reveal anything new about the insides of this iPad um this was before Jerry everything like tore his apart but I I know instinctively if you make something thinner and smaller and the speakers have to suffer right that would be smaller and magnet paper fun fact is a great way not only to see the magnets inside of a device of which
there are many here but it also shows the iPad Pro has these new much more circular quad speaker drivers as opposed to the more rectangular looking ones from before I've listened to them back to back this one versus the last generation and this one is a little bit less Bassy still loud still some of the best speakers in any tablet and very usable but physics so less room inside a little bit less Bassy with these new speakers now packaging wise not a lot has changed I mean an iPad box is still
an iPad box but two things one uh no stickers anymore so sorry Apple Fanboys if you are hoping to keep collecting uh environmental things no more plastic they're trying not to ship so much stuff but the thing is okay they are still shipping these two things with every iPad if you get a space gray iPad you get a black cable so the USBC cable but you also still get a brick with every iPad fine but it's this white 20 wat charging brick which okay I know they stopped shipping the brick with the
iPhone and they could use the same logic and stop shipping a brick with the iPad but they're still going to ship you a brick and if you do with this $1500 "$2,000 $2500 iPad could it at least be a" good brick could you at least give us the fastest charging the iPad can support and maybe even match the color of the cable maybe but anyway maybe that's nitpicking hopefully not though but let's talk about let's talk about this computer thing so the knock on the iPad Pro for years now has been that
it's a ridiculously overpowered amazing piece of Hardware but it's still an iPad like it still does basically the same set of things that an iPad Air does there's a couple little things like pencil hover and little stuff it's basically the same so they're not going to let this turn into a full-fledged computer because Apple has Macs to protect so it's kind of stuck as an overpowered iPad and with this generation well yeah it's still kind of true again this is the first time apple
is unveiling the newest generation M4 chip and it's only in this iPad Pro for now but it's even more powerful at its peak it benchmarks extremely well it's a second generation 3 NM process it has a larger and more powerful neural engine as well I mean this chip is great but as far as things that actually take advantage of that the list is very very short and some of the stuff is even like coming later this year like the new Final Cut app it's just around the corner so if you just do regular iPad
stuff watching Netflix web browsing all the classics like this this is going to feel exactly the same not just as the last M1 iPad Pro but as an M1 iPad Air you know if you get this M4 version here you can you can play those one of the like three games that support the new hardware accelerated rate tracing on this iPad uh you can use the new stem splitter feature in the New Logic Pro 2 app for iPad that actually looks incredible if you use logic on the iPad but the most interesting new thing to me
about M4 is something that they didn't really talk about they kind of glossed over it they didn't really dive into it in the keynote and they don't show it on their website very clearly but okay in the past when you're buying an iPad all you really pay more for in a single iPad lineup is storage right that's just you start with it'll be 128 gigs kind of a joke but then you go up in price and you just pay for more storage and you can get different colors and then a few years ago very sneakily we started
realizing okay you actually also get more RAM in the highest end models so if you buy more storage you'll also get more RAM so 8 gigs of RAM on the basee ones and 16 gigs of RAM on the 1 and 2 tbte iPad Pros but now on this latest one the stratification goes even further now it's also CPU course so first of all the base iPad Pro is 256 gigs now thankfully and you go from an 8 core CPU to a n9ine core CPU with the M4 but that's just with the base two versions the top two versions get another
performance core so those are 10 core CPUs instead of nine and then there's also the the nanotexture display option and this is that matte finish one that I briefly got Hands-On time with at the event I haven't gotten to see it since but it does look pretty impressive even though I do have my durability concerns with it but that anti-reflective finish is only available again on the top two options the one and two terabyte iPad Pros the expensive ones so now if you're buying a more expensive iPad Pro you're
getting different amounts of ram different CPU different storage options and different display options very computer-like if you ask me now the tandem OLED display to me is the most interesting thing about this new iPad Pro under the hood but in practice it's actually honestly just a bit of a brighter more contrasty version of the same thing we've been looking at for years a perfect example of the iPad's Hardware outpacing the software is obviously a new OLED display would be
great if you had like an all black background and maybe show just the time maybe if you had an always on display it could look super cool but the iPad doesn't have an oon display I don't want to bet money but I wouldn't be shocked if the next version of iPad OS did support an always on display with just the pros because they have the oleds now but it doesn't we got to wait till WWDC and then maybe we'll see it there but I mean aside from that it still has less blooming for just like
the perfect HDR content with pitch black blacks I love to see that if you're just watching regular SDR content though or just doing any number of regular tasks watching Netflix browsing emails or web stuff I mean you won't notice much of a difference unless you're in direct sun Max brightness that's a testament to how good iPad Pro displays have been for years in the past though now for your artists out there they've also got this sweet new pencil no the back still does
not act as an eraser as much as I wish they would do that but the rest of this thing is better than ever it supports find my now it has a new squeeze sensor inside for selecting different tools super intuitive I started using it immediately uh it also has a new haptic motor inside so you can feel this little click as you squeeze which is a nice little confirmation kind of surprised I didn't add this earlier and then it supports Barrel rotation for a few tools that specifically change when you rotate
the point and look it even has this fake Shadow so this is not a real shadow of the apple pencil this is a fake totally unnecessary computer generated Shadow that's shown on the iPad's display and it actually matches the type of tool you're using in real time with rotation that's just ridiculous and instead of just calling it the updated apple pencil they're continuing to sell the old apple pencil at the same price and they're calling this one the new pencil Pro and look I am not an artist I am
squarely outside of the Target demographic for this thing but what I do know is if this and its features are tempting to you then you will need to buy a whole new iPad to take advantage  and that was on purpose see they moved the camera to the landscape side of the iPad now which is great that's where we wanted it to be the whole time that's where the face ID array is now it's awesome it's an ultra wide camera for FaceTime and all that but that's also where the pencil has always magnetized
and charged so they actually had to rearrange the components inside to be slightly different to work with both now in the same place so it still snaps on the top like that but did they have to do that couldn't they have put the pencil on the top of the iPad or even maybe offset it so that the pencil's on one side and the camera's on the other side but no they've got it just in the Middle where it always is and I put some magnet paper up to the back so I can see that they did in fact change the magnet
layout inside like I tried pairing the new Apple pencil Pro to my old iPad Pro and it kind of stuck on sort of but didn't pair do anything all right convenient look I'm still personally not going to be buying one of these new M4 iPad Pros because of what I do on the iPad Pro and I already have a relatively new M1 iPad so I don't need one but if you don't have a relatively recent iPad then yeah this thing is great it's better than ever but I think we're all on the same page that we're waiting for
WWDC later this year to see what's new with the latest version of iPad OS to see if there's anything actually interesting that this will be capable of that we don't already know about because other than that it's kind of the same story as the last few generations of the iPad Pro speaking of things that are thin though debrand iPad skins fun fact you'd have to stack up 22 of dbrands iPad skins to make it the same thickness as the iPad itself trust me I've tried it's exactly 22 anyway dbrand has been
making the best leather skins in the business for a while now which is great because Apple actually isn't really making anything leather anymore and this is good quality soft leather like it's not some sanded down and stamped fake texture it's actually all natural full grain leather it's plush and it'll actually develop a nice patina over time since you can literally own these iPads for years so if you want to check out premium leather accessories for your iPad check out channel sponsor dbrand
