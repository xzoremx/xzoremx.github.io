okay so Apple had a nice short little 30 minute event today announcing just a bunch of new iPad stuff now this was the longest they've ever gone without updating anything iPad related so they had some cooking to do but the thing is and I feel like we've been saying this for years it kind of doesn't matter how powerful they make the iPad it's still an iPad right it's still iPad OS and we we've seen gigantic improvements in the M series chips and these iPads are like the most powerful chips ever on paper
but there's still iPads so the last thing we need after all this time is just another spec bumped iPad right well let me introduce you to the newest iPads so first up there's a new iPad Air which follows the script of bringing a few things down from the previous iPad pros and of course you know making it available for this lower price so it graduates from the M1 to the M2 Chip inside it starts up at1 28 gigs of storage now and it moves the webcam to the landscape bezel where it belongs it
gets faster Wi-Fi and for the first time there is a larger one now so they're calling it The 11-in and the 13in iPad Air I had to clarify just because the last one was 10.9 in so are they just simplifying the name like is it actually bigger and turns out yeah there is just a little bit more screen here great but other than that it's pretty predictable it's a spec bump like this is sticking to the script here I think I think I could hand you the newest iPad right now and you couldn't really tell the new Air
from the old Air just looking at it other than if you're holding the bigger one or if you recognized the super exciting new colors I mean hopefully you could hear my sarcasm through the screen but there's blue purple Starlight and space gray so it's $5.99 for the small one and $7.99 for the bigger one but then we also got a more significant update to the iPad pros this is where they push the limits of the iPad this is where they want to show their absolute best stuff the best possible tablets and
man if we just ignore the software for a second these new iPads are ridiculous so first of all they start off by revealing that these new iPads the 11-in and the 13in are the new thinnest Apple devices ever made ever that's that's including phones that's including like old iPods and everything the 11in is 5.3 mm thin and the 13in is 5.1 mm thin so that's literally thinner than the iPod Nano ever was it's nuts it just it looks ridiculous it's crazy to hold it's also lighter as you
might imagine it just kind of feels like this impossible sheet of metal in your hand I don't know if anyone ever looked at an iPad Pro and asked for it to be thinner but that's what they went and did what could uh what what could possibly go wrong fun fact this also now means that the iPad Air is heavier than the iPad Pro just to make sure we keep a mess of an iPad lineup going but the new Pro also gets a new chip and a new screen so Apple took this event to introduce us to the next generation of
Apple silicon with the M4 chip and this iPad is the only thing that it's in right now it's just the iPad with M4 so that gives it stop me if it sounds familiar even more ridiculous amounts of power in such a tiny physical and thermal envelope especially since we came from M2 so it's a more power efficient 3 nmet chip the CPU core is net out to like 50% faster than M2 the GPU is up to four times faster and they're saying that they can do the same performance output as M2 with half the
power so it's super efficient there's an improved neural engine there's better cooling now again I don't know who was asking for a thinner iPad but there's kind of no denying that it's at least just physically impressive to look at and this is the type of thing this is the form factor that is specifically enabled by the M4 chip apple is quoting basically the same battery life as the last iPad Pro and I kind of I have to assume that there's significantly less physical battery in the thing CU it's so
much thinner so that just basically means Apple's going hey we think that that was enough battery life in the last gen so we're just going to match that and that means we can go way thinner with less battery because the new chip is more efficient so then the new display this is another thing that is actually kind of enabled also by the M4 chip sometimes it seems like they're just saying that but this is also true so these are OLED iPads now both sizes it's the exact same set of features
across both iPads which kind of makes the $300 price difference between them a little bit tougher but yeah oleds on both the new iPad pros and OLED is awesome right we already knew this it's we've had OLED phones forever the pitch black blacks the individually lit pixels the super awesome Vibrance like all of the OLED stuff is great and we were excited to finally see it in a relatively gigantic display that is an iPad but making a huge OLED that's also incredibly bright was a challenge that
required just a little bit of extra engineering a little extra Ingenuity so they put together something that they're calling a tandem OLED display which honestly to me I think this is maybe the most interesting part of the whole tablet event today so you can basically think of it as two different OLED displays stacked on top of each other and then the new display driver on M4 can address both layers simultaneously so that's what's allowing them to get really high local brightness and that's
the spec now that's a th000 nits of peak "full screen brightness and 1,600 nits of" peak HDR brightness on an OLED on an iPad size screen and in person it it looks well it looks like a really bright OLED it looks super colorful really bright Inky blacks you know in this Hands-On area that I got to spend like 30 minutes in it's not going to look its best and there's crazy lighting everywhere but I will be getting my hands on it to review and I I intend to dive in and find out if there are any
downsides but it looks pretty great here and then also weirdly they announced a nanotexture m matte version of the iPad Pro so you know how there's a a matte Pro display xdr I would be I would be very careful about ordering this particular option based on what I've seen like I can see here that it is definitely better at dealing with Reflections than a normal display that's awesome but just like the desktop version that is at the expense of a little bit of sharpness and contrast you
know the blacks don't look nearly as black to me even at 0Â° off axis and I also have to wonder about durability because the pro display xdr is very picky about which microfiber cloth you use and you can literally ruin it if you use the wrong one and with this iPad you know I can feel the difference between the soft touch texture of the Nano texture and the glossy bezels and I just have a feeling that you're only going to be able to use or rely on the microfiber that comes in the box with this thing
and not only does it cost an extra $100 to get the nanotexture it's also only available on the one terab and 2 terb highest end models so I think they know that like people shouldn't just walk in the store and just get it cuz it's on the base one so yeah just be careful with that one but you know what probably made the most headlines out of all the stuff announced today is the spec bumped apple pencil there's now a new Apple pencil Pro and it looks exactly the same as the previous apple pencil but with
this new text on the back that says pencil Pro on it now unfortunately that's still not the Eraser uh but yeah this new apple pencil pro has a haptic motor inside so it supports find mine now there's also a new squeeze sensor in in the barrel for activating Tools in different apps that will support it and a new gyroscope actually makes it rotation sensitive and I was trying this it's surprisingly precise like really really good so if you're an artist not like me you maybe you're doing a barel
roll with certain drawing apps or calligraphy applications for the $129 that it costs to get one of these things but another incredibly inconvenient note this new Pro pencil is only compatible with the newest recently announced iPad Pro or iPad Air because when they moved that webcam to the long side that's also where a lot of the magnets for lining up and charging the pencil were so they had to redesign the magnets up there and that's now a different array so it's only compatible with the newest
iPads why didn't they just move it to the other side for charging I don't know maybe that makes too much sense now there's also a new magic keyboard as well still ungodly expensive but if you get the new one it's also it's lighter than the previous gen the trackpad is bigger and there's a whole function row at the top now which actually that's that is super useful and the pass through charging is even faster apparently it's 60 watts through the pins in the back but all that being said
at the end of the day guess what we just got another set of spec bumped iPads they are metal rectangles with incredible power and efficiency in our hands that are just still iPads and I don't know how many more times I can say this but like taking advantage of all this power is nearly impossible there are a tiny sliver of apps that actually make it feel like worth upgrading there's almost nothing these iPads can do that my M1 iPad Pro can't do and this isn't even to downplay the hardware cuz
the hardware is actually amazing that's that's where the difference comes from like it's got this super bright high resolution OLED displays with pitch black blacks this M4 chip with ridiculous power and efficiency new CPU new GPU better neural engine like I've never wanted an iPad to be thinner but that line about them wanting the iPad to feel like a magic sheet of glass really resonated with this model in particular even if you do feel like you could snap it in half the whole time it's just the
awkwardness of this one mainly comes from timing because I think we all know well it's already been announced WWDC their worldwide developer conference is right around the corner and we all know and expect them to update all the software across all their stuff a new iOS and new iPad OS so I guess iPad OS 18 and whatever Apple's going to decide to do with that is around the corner so we've got these new iPads shipping next week but all the new software that could be awesome well that's this summer and
this feels like it could be one of the biggest updates yet to these iPads you know it's Apple showing their hand at how many more AI features they want to build in and how many more features people want to add that lets this be their primary computer maybe more Siri improvements all of this stuff so in this awkward meantime here we have these really really impressive spec bumped iPad Pros the most powerful iPads of all time the thinnest Apple devices literally ever made but the list of
things it can do is the same as my 3-year-old M1 just saying what a time to be alive speaking of announcements though Ridge and I have finally launched our first product together so it starts with the ridge wallet you know the minimal highquality industrial wallet the more modern way to carry cash and cards well you might know I joined Ridge as the chief creative partner earlier this year and we're finally releasing our first MKBHD gear together so one of the first things we wanted to do is just
make MKBHD versions of some of the existing Stuff felt too obvious so that's exactly what we're doing so I love carbon fiber and matte black I don't know if you knew that about me already but those were my base Inspirations for these two wallets so the MKBHD carbon fiber 3K this is just a bunch of lightweight Ultra durable carbon fiber with the logo and then the map black everything wallet this is just aluminum but it's got this black oil filled engravement print which is so
sick and then these wallets also come with a debossed MKBHD money clip or uh you can do cash strap you can also attach these or detach them you could also do an attachment for an air tag so just to make sure you don't lose it or you can do a like a find my card which I've done as well but yeah I just I carry this in my wallet all the time and I definitely won't lose it and then of course if you don't like my designs that's fine Ridge has like 50 plus other designs in their catalog they've got NFL
licensed team stuff if you want to rock your team the store is endless and if you even think it could be time to upgrade it's a great time to just try because if you don't love it after 99 days you can literally send it right back no questions asked pretty sick and I'll let you in on a little secret it's 30% off the new gear right now but also any style if you order a wallet and a keyh holder at the same time so just the two together boom 30% off and also 10% off whatever you want at ridge.com
MKBHD you're welcome uh yeah I'm excited to be launching this stuff and also a bunch more coming up later this year I won't say too much about it but you can sign up at the same link if you want to get product updates I've told them just to only email you about that if you sign up but yeah let me know what you think of these new iPads in general I mean it's kind of an awkward waiting period until we get all the new iOS 18 stuff but let me know what you think new thin thinner than ever iPads thanks for
watching catch you guys in the next one peace
