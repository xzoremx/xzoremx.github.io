You could argue that these are the best beats ever these are the new Beats Solo buds they are the cheapest beats ever made $79 they are the smallest beats ever by a long way like they set the bar way smaller and lighter than even airpods and they're the best battery life in any earbuds they've ever made but that's the thing that's kind of the catch one of the craziest things they did with these earbuds is the case that they're in has no battery in it at all that's what's allowed them to get them
to be this small the case is basically just a plastic holder and so they put all the battery they could into the buds themselves giving them a quoted 18-hour straight battery life which is actually pretty incredible but then you put them back in the case and you have to charge them via USB type-c back here but there is no USBC cable included in the Box to help reach that price there's also no noise cancellation or transparency mode probably to save battery still and they
don't sound amazing but they're beats they're fine but
