so this is the new Siri coming soon to an iPhone near you well only the iPhone 15 pro and pro Max and then whatever ones come out in September but this is basically the first real change it seems like Apple's had to Siri since they forgot about it years ago so the biggest changes I've noticed are one the new animation is obviously a big one lots of rainbow Aura Vibes and it's responsive to your voice when you talk but also two you can now tap the screen twice at the bottom to type to Siri instead of having
to say everything out loud without using accessibility settings finally the default voice I think is a little more natural too so what's the tallest building in Europe the tallest building in Europe is the lacta center located in St Petersburg the Russian Federation it's uh it's not quite finished yet it's also missing some of the features Apple announced at WWDC like in app actions now it's still in a developer beta so it's super early and it's not yet available to the public but hopefully by
the time it drops around September there's even more good stuff because up until now it really feels like I mostly only trigger Siri by accident
