so this smartwatch has one really interesting trick up its sleeve that I haven't seen in any other and that honestly I don't think we're ever going to see again so at this point we know what a smartwatch is already right this is a stable mature category they deliver mostly across the board on all the same functions and aside from the one crazy trick this one is no exception this is the OnePlus Watch 2 3 years after the original OnePlus watch and it costs 300 bucks so for the $300 you're spending
you're getting a pretty nice circular wash design it comes in this black or silver stainless steel body and a sapphire coverglass over a 1.4 in 60 HZ AMOLED display design-wise You could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12 with the way the camera bump is melted into the side rail of the phone they've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch so there's a circular button at the top and this rectangular button at the bottom and I
kind of like it's a nice shape it's got this little subtle classy variation of just a pure Circle and then the back looks pretty standard too you got the four pins at the top those are for charging and it has all the sensors you'd expect for Smartwatch in the middle Optical heart rate sensor pulse oximeter for blood oxygen and of course it still has the interchangeable bands same as gen 1 and the whole thing is actually both ip68 dust and water resistant and reaches a US military
standard for durability basically means it can also withstand extreme temperature and moisture and shock among other things it's not too heavy it's built pretty well this display goes up "to 1,000 nits Peak brightness so it" looks good it's built well across the board nice so what's the catch what's the weird twist well at the beginning I mentioned like we already kind of know what a smartwatch is which is a tiny computer on your wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery and that's
fine like they all tend to have pretty short battery lives just because they're so small and so you kind of just charge them every day and that's the way it is like the main competitors here are the Apple watch which is 18 hours although that's not the most direct competitor because that's the iPhone but the Galaxy watch one of the best 40 hours of battery and the pixel watch the newest one 24 hours of battery life but this one OnePlus is claiming 100 hours 100h hour battery life in Smart
Mode which is not the battery saving mode it's actually the default mode out the box 100 hours so 96 hours is 4 days I feel like you know 100 sounds cooler so they just went with 100 but 4 days of battery sounds a lot less inconvenient so you know I had to put that to the test so for the past four straight days I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple Watch Ultra which claims 36 hours of normal use and this thing doing all the same stuff with both watches on getting notifications doing
workouts just poking around the UI and by the end I was actually very impressed with both so the $800 Apple watch Ultra actually overperformed the 36 claimed hours for me by hour 56 it was about ready to die now meanwhile the OnePlus watch had about 15% left now you're probably thinking wait that's not even close to 100 hours that's like 50 something but OnePlus told me that if you turn the always on display off that's good for two more days of battery life it's actually off by default I
turned it on for this test but that would get you well over the 100 hour mark to be fair that's also probably true about the Apple watch Ultra now one detail to consider that I think actually mattered for this particular test I've been wearing hoodies a lot cuz it's that type of weather and so even with the sleeves on this Chevron hoodie which I'll link it below because you probably want to check it out uh it covers the watch and so when you cover the watch with your sleeve it thinks it's in the
dark cuz the light sensors are covered so it turns the brightness way down on the watch and so I think that's why it outperform formed the battery numbers that it's claiming is cuz I had a sleeve over it a lot of the times and the brightness was low but even still this $300 watch outperformed this $800 Smartwatch just in terms of battery now here's the thing the way that they're achieving this battery life is I think more interesting than the battery life itself this is the twist see most
SmartWatches have a chip inside Computing everything with some high powerered cores and some high efficiency cores to balance out power and Battery life this watch has two entirely separate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them so there's a high-powered Snapdragon W5 inside that's powering weos 4 and that only lights up for things connected to that then there's also a bees 2700 chip that is always on and runs RT and they both share the same
32 gigs of Base storage and 2 gigs of RAM so were OS kicks on for the more intensive tasks like Maps or music playback but the rtos that's always on is for those basic low power tasks heart rate monitoring phone calls notifications background stuff it's like a hybrid car it's really interesting like and a fully electric car you guys already know has all the benefits of being really responsive but not the best range but a gas car has a ton of range just not as responsive as fully electric
so if you get a hybrid best of the bo worlds responsive and range and this watch it's a hybrid with the best of both worlds responsiveness and range so I've been pretty impressed you know using this thing it's responsive it has a ton of watch faces there's a lot of custom workouts which look very familiar with tracking and everything that still sends all the data to the o health app in plenty of detail for me I do still wish now shoveling snow was a workout type but that's another story but you
know these here are regular weightlifting work workouts and also can I say I really like that it is hold to end the workout not tap to end so it's way harder to accidentally stop a workout great idea also another weird Quirk this button here has a crown that rotates but that rotation doesn't actually do anything it doesn't change the volume it doesn't scroll up or down in anything it does nothing it's not connected to anything it just freely spins apparently that's literally just
to make it more durable upon impact doesn't serve any function also it does have this weird hitch that it it hasn't really gotten any less annoying which is if I get a notification I feel the buzz on my wrist then I lift up my wrist and it takes like a full two seconds to show me the notification I just got not that two seconds is a disaster it's not a ton of time but it's longer than you expect and it kind of annoys me to have to wait in comparison to other watches which
will just show me the notification right away and I feel like you can actually see the moment that it fires up the Snapdragon W5 and where OS kind of snaps on right in front of you before it shows you that notification it's very odd but here's the other Twist on top of everything we've already talked about I don't think this dual chip system is all of the magic creating this great battery life because this watch also has a 500 mah hour battery now 500 mah hours doesn't sound like a lot but here's the
sizes of other SmartWatches in competition with this and their battery sizes and how long they last and it's it's a little bigger than you'd expect now if if I gave the pixel Watch 2 which also has a Snapdragon W5 by the way if I gave the pixel Watch 2 a 500 mah battery do we think it would last 50 hours I don't know but there you go honestly at the end of the day I just came away from this mostly just impressed that they actually kept the price of this watch so low because two chips and two os's and
the work that goes into that I don't know to me that just sounds expensive and it's really not missing anything else too drastic I think it's competitive in a lot of good ways at 300 bucks so I think the clear positives would be a nice design really classy looking design nice display dual frequency GPS so that's for better accuracy and then of course really good battery life the four days we talked about is awesome but if you put on power saver mode it's up to 12 days of battery
life now this is going to disable a lot of the we OS things so it's just basic stuff exercises heart rate monitoring but you could get it to really last a week if you wanted too but then the weaknesses are definitely the delay in checking your notifications the haptics also aren't that nice and there's no iPhone compatibility but you already knew that uh but I would also say the charger is uh not that cool honestly it's kind of clunky I mean it works perfectly fine don't get me wrong but
it's just like a big plastic block with pins and magnets in it but it'll get you a full day's charge in 10 minutes and a full charge in an hour so that's acceptable but for 300 bucks I'd say OnePlus has redeemed itself from its previous efforts in SmartWatches it's pretty good like in a world of Smartwatch gimmicks there's the one with earbuds inside there's the one for Fitness there's the one for the iPhone maybe this is the one with the hybrid system and pretty good battery life
maybe that's enough for you let me know in the comments below either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace
