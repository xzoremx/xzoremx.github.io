sponsored by DJI all right I think I'm allowed to say this so I've been making videos for like 15 plus years now and there's something actually kind of counterintuitive that happens on YouTube where people are more drawn to almost like lower production value videos like obviously big lights and cameras and everything are super fun but people just want to see real life like what's happening in front of you with whatever camera you have with you so while I'm a huge video nerd and I've graduated a few
times from you know my first camera to my first DSLR to a cinema camera and these cameras actually get like harder and harder to use but I actually want to get back more into shooting just like more places just more spontaneously and more experiences and more locations not just the talking head stuff that we've gotten really good at still fun but like want to just get out more you know so anyway the the sort of Apex for that gear is you might have thought I was going to say smartphones but it's like
an action camera like this like it's even smaller it can go everywhere with you it's more rugged it can shoot everything all the time and that got me thinking well it's been almost 10 years since I got into these action cameras how good are the best ones now like you might remember when we strapped one onto Mac that one day and got the perspective of being a dog in 4k that was 2014 so similar to that this one also isn't a review but this one is sponsored by DJI and they've got this uh their newest
latest and greatest highest end action camera into my hands so this is the action 5 Pro and I figured I'd use this to take a deeper look at the tech that's going to hopefully enable more of this more freestyle shooting that I do in 2025 so the first obvious advantage of the action camera is just how tough it's built because yes we know smartphones can do an incredible job with video too but I don't know about you I'm just not trying to risk my phone in all these precarious scenarios or it would be cool
to get an angle or you put the camera someplace where it could fall or get smacked around or take a beating because that's my phone so this has always been true since the beginning I mean this thing is airtight it's built like a tank it's waterproof to 20 M with no case needed much better than most smartphones and then it's also super temperature resistant so it can operate anywhere from -20 C to 45 C I also put the fahrenheit on the screen for y'all but no free or overheating at any of these
temperatures which is kind of nuts so being more durable and smaller than any smartphone is a pretty obvious advantage to the action camera in a lot of situations but the other thing about these things is they've gotten a lot of usability upgrades over the years so I remember back in the day these used to just be back screens which was kind of like point and shoot and cross your fingers if you were on the other side but now now they've all got these dual screens so you've got a screen on the
front and on the back which is really convenient for framing things up in either direction and this one also happens to have these high brightness OLED screens so even if it's outside or something super bright I can use both screens and since it's a touchcreen and it's actually usable I can flip through settings and adjust things and get my framing right on either side it's actually very useful so this actually levels up in one other way it has a feature that I think should be more
common than it is which is internal storage so this camera has 47 gigs of internal storage hold on zui which means it saved me a couple times already where I forget to go get a memory card but I still have enough storage built in to record petition for all cameras to have that I think they should all do it they should all have internal recording so they can just record whenever and if I have a card then I can record more so this will do this is 47 gigs it's 2 hours I'm good for a
while all right Run free go explore battery life is very solid up to 4 hours non-stop recording if you turn the screen off and then DJI has a a similar clever charger that they have with their drones basically where if you put all of the batteries in this case and then charge the case it just hops each of them up and the camera itself actually will quick charge if you just plug it right in with USBC I don't have a wattage but I plugged it in at zero and it got to 20% in 4 minutes and then it was full
and 40 there's also a pressure sensor so you can tell at any time how deep underwater you are or how high of an altitude you're at if that's what you're interested in shooting and also then there's just a bunch of accessories for it for building out and shooting whatever angle whatever subject you want so maybe something kind of weird like  second I would normally not at all be comfortable putting my phone out in front of me hitting golf balls like this  oh that was close probably one of the
best things about this camera is it attaches to any accessory you want via this magnetic quick release system at the bottom which has been pretty standardized with this thing for the past few years I think other companies are starting to follow along too matter of fact the benefits of this one specifically since it's made by DJI it's directly compatible with other things DJI also makes like their newest mics the mic 2 so you can pair that easily straight to the action cam and get
scratch audio from the built-in microphones on top of all of that it actually plug and plays as a webcam so when you plug it in the options come up select webcam and it actually levels up a lot of people's webcam experiences which is pretty sick just remember to brush the dust off of it before you actually do but it's got to look good like the whole point of this is that you have this camera everywhere with you but that the footage actually looks good so none of this matters if the footage
doesn't look good so this action cam in 2024 for has one of the best it has a 1 over 1.3 in sensor that can shoot up to 4K at 120 FPS slow-mo if you want to uh there are a couple other high-end smartphones out right now with roughly the same size sensor I actually think 1 over 1.3 in is the same as the Galaxy s23 Ultra so that's a good example uh so big enough to gather plenty of light is an f2.8 lens and on top of that since it's a dedicated camera yes it can shoot log it's got a 10bit dlog m it's got hlg
so that you can get even more dynamic range to mess with in editing after the fact of course you can always just shoot normal mode if you want but if you ever want that extra range it's just a quick flip away on the touchcreen settings and it has one of the widest fields of view this is the thing about action cameras is they get super wide but this one is 155Â° so it gives you a ton of room to work with if you want to shoot in the most Ultra wide mode but there's also uh less Distortion in the more cropped
modes depending on what you're shooting it's actually plenty wide enough to shoot first person stuff like driving for example in normal mode or driving for example no Distortion needed so that brings me to my last point which is just bang for the buck like a a tiny camera like this that you can take everywhere is going to be cheaper than a smartphone that you put at risk all the time that you actually use for your phone so this camera starts at 349 bucks and also let's not forget the internal storage
that it comes with so you can pick one of these up and however many accessories and mounts and things you want and run around outside and beat it up and put it at risk all the time time and then at the end of the day if it's still fine Bring It Back and use it as a webcam if you want so I think the main thing that I've taken away from all the fun that I've had with these little cameras is you know there's that famous quote I don't know who said it but the best camera is the one you have with you you
always hear that quoted everywhere and I think I've been leaning into that more because of how often I don't have my camera with me like the cinema camera the super high-end the red camera there are a ton of instances that I can recall of like say I'm doing a tech review and there's something really cool that happens on a device or maybe like a shooting scenario with a smartphone camera and I can kind of just tell you after the fact about what happened instead of actually having the camera to
point at it and show you I want to just have the camera with me more often and just be able to show you the thing so what I'm definitely not saying is that I'm like done with you know the super high-end fun cameras I still love them there's a reason why we shoot so much stuff with the Reds and in the studio and that will always have its place but what my goal is going forward especially is to have the camera with me more often obviously I have my smartphone in my pocket but just
having a camera all the time everywhere whether it's in my pocket or in my bag or whatever so that when that shooting scenario comes up I can capture it and that can actually go in the video that's what I'm trying to do hopefully you're with me on that and hopefully you're uh down to see those videos when they come out also if you want to see that video that'll be on the autofocus Channel pretty soon it's pretty crazy one anyway let me know what you think in the comments thanks for watching and I'll
catch you in the next one peace the child
