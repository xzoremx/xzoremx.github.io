so there's a story that came out today and the headline was that Apple trained AI models on YouTube content without consent including MKBHD videos there's no statement from Apple on this yet but here's my take the real story is apple and a whole bunch of other tech companies are training their AI models using data that they buy from third-party data scraping companies some of which get their data in slightly illegal ways so one of them pulled tons of transcript data from thousands of
YouTube videos including Mr Beast videos and my videos and many more so that company is a problem and that's going to be an ongoing evolving problem for many years and also Apple can technically say they're not at fault for this but they're going to keep getting data from companies like this so that's also something they need to vet but the double Emmy is I actually pay for more accurate manual transcriptions on every video that we put out so that people who are hearing impaired don't have autoc
captions which suck so that means the stolen transcriptions specifically are paid content that's being stolen more than once
