that's crazy that the most interesting things about this new laptop are the reasons not to buy it so the MacBook Air just got refreshed it's a pretty simple update maybe a boring one actually there's really only two things new it has this new anodization on the outside apparently a slightly more fingerprint resistant look to it and it has the new M3 chip inside so the coating I don't know it it barely makes a difference if I'm being honest it still gets fingerprints if you handle it regularly
without a skin or a case I would much rather depend on something like a skin from Channel sponsor dbrand it lets you break out from one of the three really simple colors and it's going to hide fingerprints a million times better than any metal treatment ever could plus these are real leather so they have a nice plush texture and a little patina over time so I'll leave a link to this one below but the other new thing is this M3 chip inside so we've seen this M3 chip before this is what Apple does
they put the same chip everywhere this came out in October of last year and they immediately put it in the new iMac and then we also got a new Macbook Pro that launched with this and the M3 Pro and the M3 Max so okay new M3 Apple silicon third generation great so now we're finally getting this new base M3 chip in the new Macbook Air side note why does it take so long I don't know I feels like apple kind of staggers it probably on purpose but like it's the same chip everywhere they've done the
iMac they've done the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air but the Mac Mini just staying on M2 kind of weird also the new iPad Pro still on M2 when's that going to get it anyway you already know that the the MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason this is the base like entrylevel mac that most people are seeing as the way to get into the Mac world and so the base MacBook Air has typically been one of the easiest to recommend laptops in the world by Design but this one interestingly for two
reasons isn't now this has nothing to do with performance of M3 or anything weird like that like it's the performance were expecting if you look at benchmarks it's right around that 10 to 20% improvement over M2 depending on what you're doing definitely leans heavier on Graphics improvements this generation and there's the ray tracing now finally so any applications or rendering that are taking advantage of that that's going to be a noticeable Improvement for M3 and it's clearly a more capable chip and
also MacBook airs especially the 50in just constantly get great battery life across the board you also get now dual external display support with the lid closed but One external display with the laptop open and it also appears that the base storage on M3 is much improved so this was one of those concerns from if you look back at M2 you know obviously apple seeds reviewers with higher-end MacBooks so most of us aren't getting that but if you look back at M2 the base 256 gig model used a single SSD module
instead of two ssds long story short that storage module was way slower than M1 like 50% slower on paper would you have noticed if nobody told you and it never benchmarked mared it maybe possibly not but obviously it's a bummer having way slower storage on a new M2 and that extra time transferring large files that adds up over time so I'm happy to report that I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 air it appears that they fixed it awesome so what's the deal with this M3
air then why am I saying it's not necessarily the best recommendation well historically MacBook Air has been super easy to recommend but with this M3 they also loow the price of M2 by 100 bucks and discontinued the M1 so now the lineup is M3 MacBook Air starts at $10.99 then M2 MacBook Air starts at $9.99 and then M1 it's kind of gone from Apple but you can still find stock that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy now the thing about the MacBook Air being easy to recommend is we're talking
about regular people which it's very light regular normal usage like web bring listening to music a bunch of tabs open work stuff occasionally compiling or rendering some small things photo editing and chopping a video or two sometimes but really very light so these people like type of people who would buy a laptop at Walmart would be totally fine with the cheaper identical looking MacBook Air with the slightly slower M2 Chip and slower storage I think they would be totally fine but the other
thing which I need to talk about is this whole base spec thing this is not exactly new to the industry but the base price and the base spec has almost become like this weird fallacy like I think it was lonus who did a video about how starting at is like the biggest lie in Tech and he's right it's not just Tech like the car industry does it all the time too starting at you know this super low price but nobody actually gets it at that price you're not going to get a totally bare base model car the base
price is really more to give you an idea of how much you're about to spend when you actually option it up the way you want to and the issue with these is Apple's markup prices for above base spec is crazy high like apple charges way too much for the most basic upgrades obviously Apple silicon computers are all a system on a chip so they cannot be upgraded ever after you buy them right so once you buy it you know you're kind of incentivized if you're going to keep it for a long time to splurge a little
bit and give yourself some extra Headroom and future proof it and bump up that spec but Apple charges so much for bumping up that spec that the base price feels like kind of even more of a lie than usual so the MacBook Air starts in 2024 again at 8 gigs of shared RAM and 256 gigs of storage now ignoring the fact that the phone I'm using also has more than 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage if you want to upgrade to 16 gigs of memory the first available ram upgrade that's
$200 and if you want to bump up to just half a terab of storage that's another $200 more compared to how much that actually costs Apple especially at the scale that they're operating that is just crazy brutal ridiculous pricing so even if you do just that suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is "$1,500 so either you're cool with" "knowing you're actually buying a $1,500" plus doll MacBook Air or the real question is is the base spec in 2024 actually usable and my take is actually sometimes yes sometimes yes so
again if you're the people I talked about earlier you're you're buying a laptop from the showcase at Walmart or Best Buy you just needed to do the basic stuff I mentioned earlier you actually can do that with 8 gigs of shared memory no problem this might seem like a hot take but I've spent a lot of time doing this stuff you rarely actually get close to hitting the Max and hitting memory Swap and even when you do it's very much still fine it's when you get into the heavier stuff like media encoding or X
recing or gaming that it's a whole another story so if you're watching this video you already know which group of people you're in so for that massive group of people who are doing a lot of that normal Baseline Computing stuff don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air you can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air and save your money matter of fact if you don't need the brighter display the mag safe the external display support which you probably don't at this rate it's also a great idea to look into to Best
Buy or Walmart's like $6 $700 M1 MacBook airs that they're selling right now I think Walmart first announced they would have it for $6.99 and then a few days later Best Buy announced that they'd sell it for $6.49 which is pretty sick so clearly M3 is a much more capable overall chip and brings the floor of the laptop up but the way I see it what Apple silicon has done to Apple's lineup is it's brought down the minimum level of machine that you can get away with doing your workflow does that make sense
so like me I edit a lot of videos and so I need a powerful machine for Final Cut Pro and that sort of stuff right so for the longest time I could only use an apple desktop the highest and iMac Pro the Mac Pro and I still will but I am now able to use Mac Studio and I can actually edit I've had an M1 Max MacBook Pro for a while and I've been editing on the go with a laptop which which is a huge like enabler for me and the same sort of thing applies if you're doing like gaming stuff or if you have a whole
bunch of coding and heavy maybe even just encoding photos or whatever you're doing at that level you'd typically rely on a MacBook Pro but with these new chips and with apple silicon you can do that on a high-end MacBook Air which is again a pretty sweet enabler so that's what the new M3 MacBook Air is if you do that sort of stuff it's an amazing computer it should be on your short L great all around easy to recommend but again if you're doing the lightweight normal stuff and you need a MacBook Air
don't get this one get the cheaper one okay that's it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace it's the money it's it's the money it's it's the money
