all right so you've heard of flipping phones you've heard of folding phones but technology never slows down so welcome to a phone with both the world's first trifold phone this thing this is the Huawei mate XT is what it's called so I'd heard about this thing I'd seen some videos online but it's also a Huawei phone so it's China only so knowing that I'm never going to daily drive it I didn't want to like get too caught up but it's so interesting like there I I just had so many questions
like what is it like to use what are the creases like like what are the trade-offs how hard is it to carry a triple folding phone what the case is like why is it called a trifold when it only technically folds twice I just I need answers so I was like all right I need to get my hands on one I reached out to dbrand and asked like can you guys get me a contact where I can buy one and I never asked questions but they're always able to pull it off and they did so I spent the money I imported
the thing and now I can give you a tour of the trifold experience so let us start with just when it's closed right when it's closed you have a pretty reasonable 6.4 in sized phone well I mean you know reasonable from the front anyway uh if you're just looking at it using it the screen gets plenty bright it is 90 HZ and then somehow the bezels are pretty thin and even all the way around the top and the bottom the left and the right and actually of course the right side is the screen curving around
the edge so the software appropriately creates a for bezel to match and it looks it looks honestly more like a normal phone than a lot of the other foldables out there so then using it you know you pretty quickly feel that it is thicker than a normal phone but what's crazy is each of these slices individually is ridiculously thin about 4 mm so in total they add up to 13 mm thick when it's closed which would be pretty thick if it was a slab phone but that's actually about the same as a lot
of the other single folds like zold 6 so then the power button SL fingerprint reader combo button and the volume buttons on the right side here they're pushed a little bit back of the center not the end of the world totally usable you're obviously going to notice that parts of the screen are a bit exposed and vulnerable if you're going to put it in a pocket or in a backpack or something but overall just as a regularized single screen smartphone experience this is actually really
respectable this is like an 8 out of 10 really close to the best I've seen which is awesome but then you open it for the first time and from here you get to the small tablet mode so yes sizewise now we're basically matching a lot of the other folding phones out there like pixel fold Samsung zold Etc this is a 7.9 in diagonal that is roughly a square aspect ratio I'll be honest it looks fine but I actually don't really think it was meant to operate in this form factor most of the time I mean why stop
halfway when you're just one more fold away from greatness but it is clearly perfectly usable like this the crease your first crease is impressively small and very easy to ignore when you're actually using it but yeah thin bezels all the way around again blacked out pixels on the far left hand side this time and there's also still a couple little folding phone tricks like of course since the main camera is on the back and there's no selfie camera on these two panes then this is the perfect
time to take a selfie with the main camera but get a full-size preview on the 6.4 in screen that's still wrapped around the other side and they are really good Flagship quality triple cameras by the way I'll get to that in a second you of course get all the other benefits of the display spec the brightness the 90 HZ it's really solid it's obviously it's just a little awkward that it's like it's twice as thick in one hand as the other which is a little unbalanced and then it is glass
on one side and then the like sort of leather material on the other so it's it's a little bit weird in that way but honestly still very impressive I feel like this is like a seven out of 10 still pretty close but you know we're not done so this is what we're all here for the final fold which opens this thing up to a full 10.2 in corner to corner display so this is now a full 3184 by 2232 90 HZ OLED display Finn bezel all the way around amazingly with a whole punch selfie camera over to the left
side two creases two hinges and yeah this is not an iPad Mini siiz screen in your pocket this is literally a full-sized 10-in tablet in your pocket which is actually incredible now the more you play with it the more you start to notice little quirks like first of all it's ridiculously thin now that it's all open it's actually kind of disorienting to hold the tablet with a screen this big but bezels this small and like the whole thing is this thin it's just kind of a Marvel and then uh
you look at the creases plural because now you got two and you can actually see there is a small difference between the inward fold increase on the right side and the outward fold increase on the left but they are also actually both impressively small but like yeah this I'm actually kind of sad that I can't like fully daily Drive something like this because it is Huawei like you can kind of hack your way into getting some Google services on here but a lot of this UI a lot of this OS is still
Chinese only like it's not going to be great it's probably missing some bands in the us too but just wow there's a good amount of software tweaks for the Triple fold thing too like when you fully unfold it the whole UI stretches out but is still one page on each side so they've kind of just played this animation to stretch out two pages among three panels but the animation's pretty smooth and there is a wrong way to fold it too by the way and it tells you about it so obviously you
can close it pretty easily the correct way to unfold it is to get the two on the inside but if you unfold it the wrong way like that it actually tells you it's a says fold it a different way to use the device please you're kind of doing something weird here which totally fair I'll get it right next time I'll you kind of have to there is a little learning curve to according according according quickly every time but yeah this has to be a 10 out of 10 I mean there's the fact that I'm able to fit a
look at the size of this a 10in display reasonably in my pocket that that by itself is something that no other device can do so I got to love that another question I had early when playing with this is I mean people put cases on every phone what are cases for this phone like turns out it does come with a case in the box which is this thing and so really it's just one back piece of the phone that it can protect when it's fully closed so this case snaps onto the back of the phone like this and then
protects also a little bit of the exposed screen on the side so it makes sense you don't want to get any debris in there and then it has a kickstand on the back which can rotate around and support it at a couple various different angles so you can watch videos like this if you're into that and it can also rotate out of the way to expose the wireless charging coils because it turns out this phone also has wireless charging and if you just flip it sideways on certain charges you can get
it to line up and work with wireless charging so that's one type of person who will use the kickstand built into the case but there is another type of person by the way a total Reckless psycho that would unfold it like this and then use the phone itself as a built-in kickstand and it totally works like the UI responds to it and you can watch you know YouTube on a larger part of the screen but you're also totally scratching the outside part of the screen you're using as a kickstand so
yeah I'm obviously not going to recommend that uh in case you're also wondering about specs on something like this uh it's fit Flagship specs inside despite being these crazy thin slivers of a phone uh it's the flagship 7 NM Kieran 9010 chip made by Huawei um it is also up to 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage which is crazy and triple cameras on the back as you can see that's a 50 megapix main camera a 12 megapix ultrawide and a telephoto and there's a 5600 Mah hour battery chopped
up and distributed in here with 67 watt fast charging and 50 W wireless charging which is kind of insane and then the whole thing will retail it's in China so if you sort of do the conversion price this like top end model with the terabyte of storage is like $3500 so "$3,000 to" $3500 uh that's actually not that much more expensive than some of the highest end folds that we have so why is this the only trifold phone maybe that's the main question you're wondering after all
this because it's so cool it's just the fact that I can actually fit all of this in the dimensions of something that fits in my pocket is nuts and they've done a lot of things with like nice software touch that actually make it feel really well considered but uh yeah there are also some trade-offs of course I think the biggest weakness on paper is going to be the battery the 5600 millah battery you know fast charging is great obviously so that can offset it but the more time you
use this wide open with the 10 in of screen the tougher that's going to be on the battery you know if you look at typical larger tablets even the thin ones the 10-in tablets are having like "8,000 plus milliamp batteries pretty" often so that's probably the biggest weakness here the speakers are also truly terrible uh it's interesting cuz they come out of the right hand corner and the leftand corner when it's open uh but it's so thin there's just there's it's physics there's not enough room for
big Chambers for huge speakers so this yeah the speakers are pretty tiny pretty bad and then there is no IP rating for dust or water resistance some of the newer foldables have water resistance now this one not so much um and then of course the price is obviously going to keep some people away but honestly that's that's a pretty small list of tradeoffs for something that is so like shocking different and new um that I'm I'm impressed this had the potential to be like the world's greatest concept phone
remember concept phones from a couple years ago I was like this it's getting kind of weird that people are like showing off phones they're never going to make this could have been the coolest concept phone ever but then they just went and decided to actually make a bunch of them and ship them this phone also just happens to have a variable aperture lens on the main camera so it can switch between f1.4 wide open for some real background bokeh to F4 and getting more things in focus it happens
to also have that insanely fast charging it comes with an 80 watt charging brick and it has fast wireless charging and a body barely thick enough to have an entire USBC Port it happens to come with this pre-installed screen protector that I'm just never going to remove it's crazy there's just so much going on here that in this world of so many phones just being oh all phones are the same these days it's just a little different from last year not a whole lot has changed I got to hand it to projects like this
this is just insane I got to they didn't have to go this hard they didn't have to go this hard but they did thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
