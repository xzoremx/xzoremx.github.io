is this another Vision Pro video uh yes yeah just it's a good one though I promise yeah mhm I'm sure no okay so I've been thinking a lot about what a second generation Vision Pro might look like but didn't this literally just came out no I know but okay so obviously there are a lots of other VR headsets but there are lots of things that got way more interesting about this one joining the market and I if you compare this to those this is missing stuff right but that is also the most
expensive ones yeah yeah yeah it it's if there are things that the quest 3 does that if the Vision Pro did it it would feel like it's a revolutionary change to this thing it's a good video I swear all right I'll allow it this doesn't work though you can't  anyway so I don't think division Pro is going to be an every single year product update like the iPhone I think it's going to be one of those that's like every couple of years you stack up enough Tech updates every once in a while and it's worthy of a new
generation and it's a bigger deal when it comes out by the way that's how a lot of other VR headsets have been the quest 3 came out like 3 years after the Quest 2 and the psvr2 came out like six years after the first one so in a sense this this is already very early thoughts but it's been out for a little bit and we're really starting to get a sense of where people are using it and how people are getting the most value out of it and let me tell you A lot of people are definitely still not convinced on the
whole VR or Vision Pro thing at all like it's an interesting product for sure but it just doesn't do much and I started having those thoughts immediately as soon as I started testing this thing just all sorts of missing stuff that I would like it to do so this is all those things in one place so probably the biggest thing that you've noticed if you've been familiar with the VR headset world or used any any other VR headset before is the Vision Pro is missing shared experiences like you are always
so alone in this headset like meaning there are lots of other great super immersive experiences and you can be productive and you can watch a movie but no matter what's happening you're always alone even if you have past through on nobody else can see what you see and so it's basically impossible to share what you're experiencing without you know mirroring everything on an iPad or something like that now FaceTime is close it's it's one thing but I'm talking about sharing one virtual space
with more than one person or seeing the same virtual environment at the same time with multiple people or or seeing the same virtual object from two different perspectives at the same time you ever play recck room it's one of the it's one of the oldest but most fun games on The Meta Quest it's just so simple you're just out there having fun but it's a bunch of people running around a room or an environment to different game areas where they can jump into an experience and play a game
together so in that digital space you look around and see other people and I use people with air quotes but you see them they see you and and you can see the same environment from different angles at the same time and explore it together it doesn't even have to be super realistic or high resolution or convince you that it's another reality but it's just way more social and interactive and that way but on Apple Vision Pro aside from FaceTime really all the other experiences it's just you
in there solo like there's nobody else in there so no matter what you're doing no matter how immersive the movie is or no matter how good the game is around you you're in there by yourself and nobody else can see what you're seeing like just here's a basic example how sick would it be if you and the person next to you on a plane could sync up your experiences and both watch the same movie in a virtual theater at the same time simple as that or maybe if you were manipulating a 3D object in
space wouldn't it make a ton of sense for someone else to be able to share that object with you so that they can see how you're manipulating it like it feels like it just makes too much sense I told you guys about that sky guide app which has like you know you look up and there's all the stars and the constellations and it shows you where they're all supposed to be it is pretty awesome funny enough there's a laser pointer feature that lets you point a laser pointer at the sky and like circle
around and point at things and draw things but still nobody can see what you're pointing at with the laser even if they have a Vision Pro so there are two basic types of shared experiences that it would just be great for Apple to add to this thing the first one is two different people with vision Pros are in the same room with pass through on and one of them drops a virtual object into that room and the other can see it at the same time manipulate the object they can see it as well great the other is
two different people with vision Pros in different places halfway across the world doesn't matter they both turn on or join the same virtual environment and can see it at the same time as of right now I believe the first one is harder because the way these headsets work with the pass through basically in real time they are mapping the volume of space around you with the sensors on the front of it the surfaces the walls the floor the objects around you and everything that's how Vision OS
is able to lock your apps floating in 3D space and how it's casting Shadows onto different surfaces in your room with decent accuracy but there's no guarantee that if you're in a room with someone else who also has a headset on that both your headsets are mapping the room in the exact same way like maybe I place an object into space but your headset doesn't see space there so it's confused or it doesn't map my hands or or any what I'm manipulating in the exact same way it's just not exactly guaranteed to
be the same but the other kind just sharing a virtual environment someone builds with anyone anywhere in the world seems like a no-brainer like being able to watch a movie in a virtual movie theater with someone else who also gets a seat in that movie theater playing an obvious multiplayer game in the same environment like this stuff is is pretty basic with VR I love multiplayer table tennis in the quest it's one of my favorite shared VR experiences you can play against people anywhere else in the
world there's all kinds of other multiplayer games like this in VR that is a huge part of the VR Gaming experience and I just wonder why this doesn't have that yet seems like a huge huge thing especially and I know you know Apple has environments that they built in but and they're massive and high resolution but you can only move a little bit before you're out of the Play Zone if you will it's it's fascinating I wonder if that's something to do with the way Apple thinks about these
environments nevertheless what I know is that's the number one missing feature on the Vision Pro that I'd love to see in a second gen now the other big one that stands out to me is if I want to use Vision Pro a lot in let's say multiple just two different locations home and work I wish that it had a memory of all the windows and apps that I leave open in each Place See Vision Pro is actually already amazing at this in one space it's seriously incredible windows stay locked to where
you leave them as it live Maps its way around your space so you can pin something to a wall and then walk around and pin something to another wall or just in the middle of the room leave the room come back they're still there I even try it ready for this I pinned a window right here between these two cars in the parking lot then I turned and walked away just left it behind me in the parking lot walked inside walked all the way down this long hallway totally out of sight around another Corner into
the studio and sure enough that window is still right there where I left it between those spaces in the parking lot the only thing holding it back from being nearly perfect is occlusion basically the only thing that ever gets between the window and you is your own arms and hands which is usually totally fine but if you have something like around a corner it doesn't put the wall in between you and the window which is where it should be so sometimes it gets a little wonky but overall 9 out of 10
already really cool but the second it gets dinged is when you want to do this in more than one space so let's say at home I've set up all these sweet monitors I've got a virtual TV in one room and a game and some windows all over the walls or whatever cool I pack it up I drive here to the studio and I put it on and the second I start opening apps here they have to disappear from home they basically disappear from any other space and open in your new space so there is no memory of different older
spaces so when I go back home my windows are all going to be gone and I'll have to set them each individually up again not a huge deal but if it had a memory wouldn't that just make sense I wonder if you could set up like little beacons like all it really probably needs is like a QR code or some visual identifier but basically you get home you put the headset on it sees the beacon and then it goes oh I'm at home and then it puts your windows all the way up where it already knows you usually have them for
work and so you basically just kick back on the couch put the headset on and you don't have to reset up each window in all the same placees you want it every single time it just remembers that that would be sick those two features alone I think would make a dramatic update to how often I realistically would use Vision Pro just I don't know if that requires some Vision OS software update or if you need more compute to do things like more memory of locations or shared Computing spaces but that's that's the
giant things that I think are missing from it that would be awesome then the rest of the stuff on my list anyway is maybe a little more icing on the cake like here's another one I think probably 99 99% of people who buy a Vision Pro have an iPhone I think that's pretty SI it might be 100 but I I think that's a reasonable assumption and I I found it interesting I think a lot of people assume that it'll just connect to the iPhone and they think that they'll be able to see their phone notifications
straight away on the Vision Pro but it's not it's a separate device like a Mac or an iPad so yeah it'll show you iMessage stuff cuz that's everywhere but it is a separate device but you know the obvious difference is like a Mac or an iPad when you put on a headset well now you're wearing a headset so if I were to get a phone call on my iPhone I couldn't necessarily even see that I'm getting a phone call out there is no notification for it in the Vision Pro and I I'm going to have to take the
headset off to even see it coming and accept that phone call so it would be nice to have an option where these two things talk to each other a little better just a little maybe a little hub for just my smartphones notifications over to the the side if I want to check them I think it makes sense they probably won't do that though but here's  "3,386 that is the pixel density of the" vision Pros displays it's kind of a "ridiculous number over 3,000 pixels per" inch each so there's been some tear
Downs I'll link some below the like button you can see them up close they are incredibly sharp so that and the high refresh rate and minimal distortion all contribute to a pass through and just everything feeling so real but the number I'd actually like to improve is 92 so the uh the vision Pros displays show 92% of the DCI P3 color gamut pretty good coverage like for a display that's honestly pretty good the reference grade display that is like the pro display xcr for example that'll show
you 99% of DCI 3 so again it's it's for a display a pretty great number but the thing about a VR headset is it's it's replacing your eyes like it the pass through is pretty good for what it is but without getting too complicated 100% coverage of dcip P3 is about 50% coverage of all of the colors that the human eye can see so this headset looks great and it's very sharp but it's only showing me a little less than half of the colors of reality so I wonder how much they can improve that
because the human eye is OB obvously insane it has crazy dynamic range and fiated rendering and great sharpness and all that fun stuff but you know Apple's been really good at a lot of displays for a long time and these are some incredible displays so field of view wider please but also yeah just generally more color would be interesting there's lots of other little things that are obvious like weight reduction please of course um higher quality screen recording is a niche
little request of mine but I think would help a lot for people trying to make videos with these things uh also even more specific keyboard pass through while in an environment so you're an environment you're typing you've got your virtual Mac display and if it can see and recognize my hands after a scan I think it would be nice if you could also build in a feature to scan your keyboard or recognize the keyboard of your MacBook just cuz it's going to look the same every time kind of like my hands all
that being said I'm sure there are more things that are people you know thinking about on their lists but let me know what you think about Apple Vision Pro Gen 2 maybe leave your wish list in the comments below thanks for watching catch  peace
