all right so if you're watching this when I'm publishing it then that means that I am in Australia right now competing for a world championship the world Ultimate Frisbee championships where I'll be playing for Team USA mix now this is different from the beach World Championships where I also play with USA mix and we got bronze and it's also different from the club World ultimate championships which uh we got gold with Pony in 2021 but ultimate is confusing but basically the story is
every few years there's a world championships and USA invites a bunch like 200 people to a try out and then selects like 25 people per team to represent USA in the world championships that year there's a men's team a women's team and a mixed team and I've been trying out for or trying to play for these teams basically for my entire ultimate career that's been like the thing that I look up to so I remember right out of high school Jun Junior worlds u20s I applied got a try out
didn't make the team uh a little after that u23s I applied also got a tryy out didn't make that team and then I've been trying not even getting invited to tryouts for the you know the past couple World Championships then 2023 comes along I end up getting on the beach worlds team and then 2024 for the grass team I got a try out and I actually made the team so Team USA mixed that's that's where we're at so I tweeted about this earlier this year that this will be a a bit of a busy year for ultimate for me
just between the pro teams and the club team and the USA training camps and then the actual tournament itself so kind of already knowing I'm probably going to end up actually missing a few Tech things but that I'm totally fine with that but so yeah by the time you see this I am I'm heading down or I'm in Australia or something I'm going to edit this on the plane but um that's a weekl long tournament where we'll be competing internationally against all the the best teams from all over the world which is
super exciting it's an honor it's a thrill it should be really cool there is a site called ulti world that will be covering the tournament maybe live streaming a few of the games but behind a pay wall probably but I'll also try to post some stuff that I can on Twitter when it's available just so you guys can be updated with what's going on but yeah that's uh I do know so our first few games we know already are against Switzerland Austria Argentina and Japan but that's also an extremely long flight
so I'm gonna edit this on the on the flight and hopefully that keeps me busy for some of the hours but I haven't done one of these in a while a Q&amp;A I asked you guys on Twitter what you wanted to know about gadgets Tech YouTube ultimate whatever life anything and these are your best questions by the way some of you asked me last time what this mic is this is a teenage engineering cm15 I have loved this mic for the past couple years I need a better stand for it so I'm handholding it but anyway okay first
question what do you think of about Cristiano Ronaldo joining YouTube and his meteoric rise 20 million subscribers in a little over 24 hours is crazy yeah that is pretty insane and it's continued I think it's like 30 something million plus now yeah that's that's sick and and I think that's just a testament to where YouTube is at not a lot of people who are that famous are not on YouTube and also YouTube I don't think people realize Ronaldo's like one of the most follow humans on social media it's got
like 600 million on Instagram so 30 million is like a rounding error to this guy but also yeah people are saying he might he's passing Mr Beast soon or something like that I would pump the brakes on that I just want to see what he actually does on YouTube because there's a bunch of videos out now he's not running it there's somebody running it for him but how long do they keep it up what types of videos do they actually make do they like lean into the YouTube culture do they collab with anyone at
all or do they just like make highlight reels of his of his day or whatever it is I don't know I Mr Beast is at like 300 million so that's a long way from 30 million but uh we'll see how the trajectory goes based on what they actually post uh what app is number one in your screen time probably weighs honestly with all the recent road trips and stuff um or it may it's also probably tick tick I just just to-do list apps I'm just always in there oh this is a good one this is a good one what's a piece of
technology that you you have that isn't worth making a video about but you now couldn't live without that is a really that is a good question my real answer is probably my calendar app just cuz like I'm not going to make a video just all about my calendar and how I maybe I should I don't know but that's something I could not live without um but it's it's accessory stuff like my mouse like that I've made an MX Master Video maybe I do make videos on these things my uh my studio monitors at the
studio I have the Yamaha hs8s I've never made video about those but I've had them for years and years and years and they are so tried and true so I'm going to I'm going with that cuz they are some my favorite equipment I know you probably wanted like an everyday Gadget but Yamaha hs8s are the truth M okay how long before we get to know if the Vision Pro Apple Vision Pro was a success or a failure and they haven't launched the second one yet of course it has been fascinating to watch like the Arc of the
Vision Pro I also tweeted recently because I'm curious if people who have Vision Pro still use it every day I know I don't I started using it a lot in the beginning and then my usage just fell off a cliff and there's new experiences for it and there's new apps but I think everyone's usage for Vision Pro was very high in the beginning and now has like stabilized to some level but is Vision Pro a success or not I mean that a lot of people are saying no because it hasn't sold well and it's it's
"$3,500 of course it hasn't sold well" that's not really a shock I am mostly curious though about the second generation part what the second generation is is the thing that teaches you the most about how that company feels about that product about how it's hitting the market about what actually worked with the first gen and I suspect that Apple's next version of The Vision Pro is not pro it's just Vision I mean they they put the word Pro on the end because this is the high-end one but
there will be a apple Vision or whatever so vision air whatever they call it but a lower PRC version that will aim to be a stripped down more mass produced version for more people that one's going to be the most interesting one obviously Vision Pro is exciting and at the bleeding edge but what comes after Vision Pro that's that's what I'm interested in oh someone said what is the oldest phone you think you could use as a daily driver today whoa okay to honestly because
there's some old there's some throwback phones that I really like so my mind is going to the last few I'm looking I'm thinking about OnePlus 7 Pro that phone was super smooth super like very usable for a long time when did that come out the OnePlus 7 Pro was unveiled on May 14th 2019 okay so a 2019 phone that's I guess that's five five years ago is kind of a long time in Tech terms but the other one I think is the pixel 3 XL you know the bathtub Notch the big big bathtub notch pixel that one might
be the same year oh 2018 okay October 9th 2018 6-year-old phone pixel 3 XL still has a good camera still has that clean software I don't know about getting all the software updates at this point but that those are like some of the oldest phones I think I could legitimately stale daily today what is the best Ultimate Frisbee move you have ever witnessed wow okay I've seen a lot in person I've had the of playing with some alltime athletes and players you know if you look up Ultimate Frisbee highlights
on YouTube it's crazy because there this is a it's still a young Sport and there's not a lot of great footage of lots of games that get played and so crazy highlights and athletic plays happen all the time but they aren't really filmed very well when they are they immediately make like ESPN top 10 and they're like some some of the sickest highlights to watch but um I got to think of so there's actually two throwing highlights that come to mind just as someone who's trying to become a
better thrower one is my teammate Jimmy's throw in semis in 2022 at Nationals this crazy upwind flick hook that was just it was just ridiculous it needs so much strength and then also Harper my other teammate he's also playing on this worlds team by the way uh had this sick sick Hammer from the sideline in the finals of the pro league in I want to say that was 2021 maybe but against Dallas and that was one of I was right on the sideline next to it and I've never seen it throw like that in my
life oh possibly my favorite game though uh I've played in a lot of fun games comebacks though always the most fun to play in and there was I really hope my teammates remember this when when we were in high school we played against a ycc team so a like a high level youth team youth Nationals team on our home field in front of of our parents and we went down 80 at halftime and then we came back and won the game 1514 it was one of it was probably the most fun I've ever had on a field uh and on a sideline
like cheering on teammates like that type of game that's very rare I will never forget that how much do you use Chachi PT or similar in your daily life do you use AI as well to check correct or edit content and how much AI is use in in content Creation in general what's your feeling about it I've been asked a lot about this AI stuff uh a lot lately like how much do I use AI tools how much how do I feel about them obviously there's a lot of controversy with them being trained on our content um it's
it's actually pretty minimal for me so I use it occasionally for brainstorming and for expanding on or rewriting ideas uh I in obviously not these Q&amp;A videos but I I do write out basically almost everything in the actual reviews and the the topical videos that I make and so sometimes it's useful to use gemini or chat GPT to like twist an an idea or to come up with something and brainstorm so that's one thing I don't use AI to edit almost anything we don't use AI generated music we don't use AI
generated images or anything that's kind of just like a fun tool to play with when are you releasing your next sneaker um all I'm going to say is teber is going to be pretty sick I'll put it that way we already know teber is usually very busy and it will be busy again but it's we got some extra stuff planned for tember and Beyond so I just I if you haven't subscribed already get subscribed there's so much good stuff coming up oh how how did it feel to have Steph Curry respond to you oh
you didn't know Steph and I are like we're super tight like we're yeah we're super close like that that one time that I met him that we shot a commercial together that yeah we've been yeah Bros ever since then obviously no I think it's hilarious I tweeted at him I tweeted mentioning him during I didn't even mention him I just said Steph Curry is my goat during the Olympics when he was going on that Barrage at the end of the finals game against France and then I guess he logged into Twitter this week
and decided to reply to one comment and it was mine hey talk that talk Steph okay Quinn asks what percentage of your driving time is spent in each of your cars valid question I do review a bunch of cars I spend time with those but when I'm not there are three vehicles in the fleet and I'm probably going to get rid of one of them soon but I spend 90 something per of the time dailying the "Turbo S I have 12,000 miles on it at" this point in a couple of months and it's everything I was hoping it would be
I got to say it is pretty incredible then the last few per are spent in the rivan r1t so the Cyber Tru don't really use very much and there's also that clause in the sales uh that or the the purchase agreement that you can't sell it within a year so we just kind of have it uh maybe we'll still try to sell it I don't know maybe we'll attemp I mean it's good for work we've used it for work a bunch of times shooting rollers uh going to shoot that PGA tour video like it fits the most gear it's the
biggest truck it's the most stuff great for road trips with the team but yeah it's like 95% dailying the Turbo S 4% r1t 1% cybertruck at this moment okay do you think Tim Cook actually believes the magic Mouse's ergonomics are done well no I do not think he believes that you if you're if you are unfamiliar I did ask him about it in my interview with him recently and when I ask him about the Magic Mouse you can see it in his eyes genuinely that is the first time anyone has even mentioned a magic
mouse to him in years and I actually honestly now I'm saying this out loud this is one of the things that I think most people don't understand about like these types of interviews like the small time example is Tim Cook obviously does not deal on the daily with the specific ergonomics of the Magic Mouse I mean almost nobody does at Apple but definitely not Tim Cook Tim Cook is the CEO which means his job description is the highest level stuff it's the strategy it's the it's the business it's
if you're if you're Tim it's the supply chain stuff that's what Tim Cook makes daily decisions on and so when I'm interviewing someone like this it feels like that would be the thing to talk to them about but also that's like some of the less exciting stuff I want to get into nitty-gritty about tech so the the thing I guess the point I'm trying to make is the talking teex series it started as I want to do interviews and talk to people with interesting perspectives on technology
at all and the first episode was a virtual interview with a a tech person but then it was also Kobe Bryant mixed in with Neil degrass Tyson mixed in with Will Smith like there's a a wide variety of people who have interesting thoughts on Tech but it turns out when you do one or two other Tech executive interviews all the rest of the tech executive PR teams also reach out and want to do an interview and then we just kind of fell down that slippery slope of like we just did all the tech CEOs and most of them
are let's be honest they're they're media trained PR machines so I want to talk to more product people I want to talk to more like people who are in the nitty-gritty of actual product stuff and also who are not even in the tech world just for their perspectives on Tech like I saw you're probably wondering I saw the Lewis Rossman video and while I I think he has a lot of good points and is totally valid to feel like you know oh talking to someone at Apple is is just Shilling uh I guess you guys don't know
I cut like 90% of the actual interview and things that I talked to him about I talked to the the head of hardware at Apple hoping to get even more nitty-gritty with Hardware but still got a lot of like fluff and cut almost all that stuff I kept like the 10% that I felt was actually compelling and interesting about you know Hardware being designed for longevity versus repairability but people didn't love that either but either way yeah I'm I'm I'm hoping to talk to more people who
are actually doing the stuff on the ground and who are are heav involved in the product stuff so long story short I feel like I'm probably done with tech CEO interviews we've also kind of done them all at this point it's it's not like people are clamoring for the next one so I'm I'm interested if you guys have suggestions on what people should be next on the list for talking Tech who should we actually add and have a chat with oh this is a good a good one maybe to end with so YouTube is the crown
jewel of video platforms right now I would agree why is that will a different platform disrupt it in the next 10 years and if so why would that happen uh and the short answer is stability and money like people for for the entire history of time they go where the money is so YouTube has been the most stable platform for Discovery and for monetization for the longest time and that is why they are the crown jewel of YouTube That's why Instagram is like spinning its tires and trying to find
way way to compensate creators to get them to stay and be discovered that's why Tik Tok number one is trying to compete with YouTube they just enabled like super long videos but also if they don't pay people that's why you see Tik tokers getting huge on Tik Tok and then moving over to YouTube that's why you see Cristiano Ronaldo starting a YouTube channel it's just the place that you can be discovered and make money now will it ever be disrupted in the next 10 years because at this point it's like also now
the world's video library it is it feels huge like too big to fail and it all it kind of seems like it it can't fail like the the one thing that could take down YouTube would be what an adpocalypse right some event some horrible series of things that ruins Advertiser trust in being able to advertise on YouTube and for creators to make money a literal adpocalypse that drives advertisers away and that happened and then months slash years later slowly they all came crawling back cuz guess where the
eyeballs are oh they're on YouTube so yeah I always say YouTube is so big that if if it ever were to fail it would be such a slow catastrophic played out failure that we'd have time to see the sinking ship and and jump to the next ship if there is one that's doing a better job but yeah they've been the most stable for a while and I don't mind that one bit but yeah I think that's it that's a good place to end it there's some good questions in there let me know if you have other questions I'll hang out in
the comment section below of course I'm probably not going to for the first week cuz like I said I'm in Australia right now I'm in the upside down hopefully winning some Hardware but yeah taking a little break while I do that I'll see you on the other side thanks for watching thanks for listening and subscribing and I'll catch you guys soon peace
