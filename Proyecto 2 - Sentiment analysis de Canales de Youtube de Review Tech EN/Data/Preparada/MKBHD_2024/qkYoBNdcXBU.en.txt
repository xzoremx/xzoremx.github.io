so we just got done with possibly one of the biggest apple WWDC Keynotes of all time maybe just because of the state of the world and what everyone expects from tech companies in 2024 which is AI at the front of what you do interestingly with apple this time Apple had AI at the back half of what they did literally the entire first half of the keynote they didn't say AI once zero times then the second hour they just went all right yeah we we actually do have a lot of AI stuff to share with you and they just
spit it all out and of course they did manage to Brand it because of course they did AI for them is now Apple intelligence but look I watched and live tweeted the entire 2hour long keynote so you don't have to and I've gathered all my thoughts and all the most important announcements so this is everything you need to know that's new and some of my takes on it so I'm going to go in the same order that Apple went I'm going to start with vision OS and we're already on somehow Vision OS 2.0 less than half
a year after the Vision Pro first got announced and there are some solid new features but I don't know if I would call this 2.0 worthy it feels more like a 1.2 update but okay whatever we'll go with it so there's a new wrist turn gesture to quickly see the time and your battery percentage and then you can jump right from there into the control center instead of having to like look way up at the ceiling like you had to before every time kind of reminds me of the Oculus Quest that is easy that's an upgrade
there's a bunch of immersive media features like they let you go through your old photos and use Advanced machine learning to turn them into spatial photos which is really interesting if it works and there are also new tools to help people create spatial videos and immersive videos on cameras other than the iPhone but then of course you can only view them on a Vision Pro so who knows how valuable this will actually turn out to be but then this year Mac mirroring will get way more resolution
thanks to it now doing the fiated rendering on the Mac so basically it frees up a ton of resources and it lets you do up to double the resolution so you could do a gigantic ultrawide if you want it to be that is way more room for Windows and activities love that and that's pretty much it again it's not the biggest 2.0 update we've ever seen but it does feel like there's some nice updates in there including some new environments and the ability to rearrange your home screen believe it or
not you couldn't do that before now you can but speaking of rearranging your home screen iOS just got one of the biggest or at least most interesting updates in a long time and I'm just going to if you're an Android User I'd say for the next like 2 minutes 3 minutes just go ahead and unplug your keyboard for a second and just relax cuz yes we've had these features for a long time but now it's the iPhone's time to shine all right so officially you will finally be able to put icons wherever
you want on the iOS 18 home screen grid and it was hilarious that this got a whole Applause moment from the audience during the keynote as if they just inv vented a new feature but fine you've been waiting for a long time for this have your fun but they didn't stop there they added a whole bunch of other customization features to the iPhone home screen 2 and it started to get a little more interesting see there's this new theme engine now that lets you go in and change the color of every icon and
widget on your home screen to the same color so you can really you can match your wallpaper with your icons to frame it nicely and have matching colors everywhere it's a simple thing and we've been doing it on Android with launchers for years but the thing about these is before this moment basically every iPhone home screen look the same we've been saying that they've just given you the ability to go crazy and kind of ruin your home screen if you want to and people seem to absolutely want to I have
seen some rough home screens people are making on Twitter a lot of them just look terrible and I think the main thing I noticed is it seems like there are apps that support this whole colored thing well and then there are apps that don't that just looks like it tints the entire it just literally applies a color cast to the entire icon on your home screen which causes all kinds of legibility problems doesn't look good there are widgets that look horrible that it's just unreadable so
yeah you can make some some pretty looking home screens if you want but you can also make some really ugly looking home screens and I was trying to decide if I like this more or less than what Google did on the pixels with material U I think technically technically it's better because it works on all of the icons I don't know how many setups I've tried where I wanted to the monochrome icons but there are just a few of my apps that aren't supported so they end up looking kind of like they stick out
like a sore thumb so at least apple is letting you change all of the icons at once but anyway Apple's also redesigned the control center to be fully customizable across multiple pages so again there's a lot more going on here and there are many more customizable shortcuts in more places including finally replacing the flashlight and camera on the home screen without jailbreaking finally and the list keeps going stop me if you've heard these before but there are you can do hidden
apps now inside your app drawer so you can lock apps into a hidden folder that makes it easier than ever to hide Tinder from your wife there's also scheduled text messages an iMessage great finally they're having some fun over there there's also text formatting there's messages via satellite RCS support was very casually but briefly mentioned uh the photos app is redesigned there's also a game mode that now minimizes background activity and minimizes Bluetooth latency for peripherals great
and a new automatic categorization in the new mail app so you can tell there's there's been a whole bunch of stuff I will definitely be doing a larger more Focus just iOS 18 video so you can see everything that's new there's plenty of little stuff that didn't make it into the keynote so I'll do a whole Deep dive just for that make sure you subscribe to be among the first to see that I believe we are catching up to Apple and subscribers be kind of nice if we pass them that'd be sick so then airpods got
minor updates like voice isolation during phone calls spatial audio during games and the ability to respond to a prompt just by nodding or shaking your head taken right from the Sony headphones I kind of like it though controlling it without using your voice is nice then Apple TV gets this new feature where you swipe down on the remote at any point during a show and it just shows you all the actors and character names of the people on the screen and any song that's playing in
that moment in real time and there's also a feature that boosts people's voices so you can always hear them over the music and then watch OS they got this little training mode that sort of balances the trends in your training over time and evaluates how hard a workout was versus how hard it could have been and then iPad OS so this was supposed to be Apple's big chance to really convince us that the iPad is it's something special that's got a little something to it that would make us
convinced that we'd want to get the newest one the M4 one that just came out over just your phone or over a Mac and I'll say it did get one incredible feature but it didn't really do much more than that so the iPad it you know gets all the stuff I talked about with the iPhone right full home screen customization customizable control center the new photos app Etc it's all great there's also a feature in share playay that lets you go in and actually remotely control someone's iPad when
they allow it which seems like a small thing but I promise you that is massive for family tech support you know who you are but the one massive actually impressive new feature on the iPad in iPad OS 18 and you think I'm joking but I'm dead serious when I say this it's the calculator app it's the new calculator I promise you I was so ready to dunk on this like I had had a tweet like drafted up as they were talking about it we finally brought the calculator the iPad and there were
screenshots of it and it looked just like the iPhone app and I was like really this is this is what you were so hyped about had that clip CED up ready of Craig federi being like yes we had to do something super special to finally bring their calculator to the iPad but then then they pulled the apple pencil off the side and they pulled up what's called math notes and it was pretty sick so now on the iPad you can actually write down equations in handwriting and it will understand what you wrote and
it'll answer the question in your handwriting and then if you adjust the equation or add new information or something it automatically updates the answer which was so sick I don't know why I'm so impressed with this but it was really cool to play with and look at so if that wasn't impressive enough it also supports variables so you can have variables written all over the page so look at this it has G and X and A and H and then it's a labeled y as the height here so you can ask for an equation
using these variables and it can give you an answer and if you want you can do a y equals equation and it'll give you a graph with real time adjustment of any of the variables in your equation I mean I I wish I was in sixth grade again so this could be my full-time calculator this is sick now at this point in the keynote they haven't even actually said the word like AI a single time yet I think this is pretty clearly AI this is like handwriting recognition this is like semantic understanding of all the
things happening on the page it's good AI well played Craig you did it okay but this is before the actual AI section but also this wasn't mentioned on stage but this is also coming to the iPhone's calculator app as well but then Mac OS Mac OS has its newest version It's called Sequoia and it does also get a nice little grab bag of new features there's uh automatic window snapping now finally built-in you don't need a third party app to do it anymore sherlocked uh there's built-in backgrounds for any app
that uses the webcam feed there's also a new password app that basically just takes what was buried in the settings before and just makes it its own Standalone app so it's actually on Mac iPad and iPhone but probably the biggest thing is iPhone mirroring so this is another continuity feature that basically just lets you wirelessly always see your iPhone on your Mac it merges your notifications and audio with your Macs and lets you drag and drop things back and forth between your phone
that's sitting next to you and your Mac I kind of wonder if this hits your phone battery harder than normal they didn't really say Obviously so I'm going to have to test this but I imagine if you're just sitting on a wireless charger then it won't matter but I'll be checking that out but then we arrived they did all the sections with all the other operating systems and now we got to the part where Apple's going to talk about AI stuff kind of now I don't know if you remember this but a couple months
ago not that long ago I did an entire video on all of these phrases that it seems like apple refused to say on stage they just would not say them and AI is one of them they just didn't say it they'd say anything else neuron Nets machine learning all sorts of other things like that but the times are the times people want to hear Apple talk about AI so they finally did and they also like I said they they rebranded it just for themselves just to just comedere the AI name and so now it's called Apple
intelligence in apple land so here's basically what you need to know about Apple intelligence right so Apple has already had AI features on their devices before they've had the neural engine inside of their chips and they've done things like you know smartly cutting subjects out of photos they've done things like autocomplete on the keyboard that's already existed but this new Apple intelligence is basically a bucket of these new generative models and what they do on your devices so there's these
new diffusion models generative models and large language models that are all built by Apple that bring new functionality to the supported devices and actually I'll just get that out the ra right off the bat these are only supported on the highest end versions of currently available Apple silicon so that just means iPhone 15 Pro and any iPad with M1 or later and any Mac with M1 or later so what does that look like well basically starting with these new os's there's a small Suite of tools
that's kind of sprinkled across everything it's not like there's one apple intelligence app or something like that they're just kind of sprinkled throughout so here's an example writing tools you know we all know how powerful these large language models can be so anytime you're writing in you know Pages or keynote or basically anywhere where there's a cursor you can use the writing tools to summarize or rewrite something that you've already written it can change the writing style or just
proofread just basic useful stuff here's another one remember the Magic Eraser Tool in Google photos and these Android phones that use it Apple's finally doing that too built into their own photos app is a cleanup tool and it's basically the same idea this will identify background items it'll let you Circle items you don't like in your photos and just get rid of them fill in the background with gener to fill super quick and there's also gen emojis generative emojis and this may feel really old cuz I would
never use this but apparently there's a whole group of people who go through searching for emojis and then they find that there's one that doesn't exist and they're like dang I wish I could just make an emoji for this moment right now and for those people yeah now now you can you can generate a new Emoji you can literally type it fit in like a prompt and the diffusion model will create that new emoji from scratch in the style of all the other emojis and they had an entire thing called the image playground
that's built into a bunch of Apple's apps but also has its own separate app that lets you create these nice little square images with prompts in three different styles sketch illustration and animation and yes there are also Siri improvements that's using the large language models to generally understand context better and just generally be better and more natural at being an assistant that isn't garbage and later in the year it will also be able to pull info from inside of apps and take
actions inside of apps for you too I remember when this was like a huge Bixby feature on Samsung phones so that's cool to see plus there's also this like big pretty new full screen animation when you're triggering Siri to tie it all together its vo is apparently slightly updated and you can now also type to Siri instead of talking to it out loud every time which is long overdue but also nice there's Notes app summaries there's phone call summaries just all kinds of you know features sprinkled
around like I said definitely I want to I think I'll end up making a video just summarizing or testing or reviewing all of the Apple intelligence stuff cuz it's kind of all over the place but now you know what it is but one question that's been floating around the internet is what stuff is happening on device versus things that have to go to the cloud and this is also come up a lot because you might have also heard about Apple partnering specifically with open AI to integrate chat GPT 40 into this apple
intelligence stuff so it's a big question everyone's wondering so I got the official answers from Apple and the answer is basically almost everything happens on device intentionally and those are from Apple built models so that should be the fastest stuff that happens but in the chance that there are things that are too complex or just outside of the area of expertise of Apple's models then it can basically go one of two ways one is it will go to a larger server-based model that's on
servers that Apple has built with apple silicon using what they call Private Cloud compute so basically the info is never stored or sent to Apple it's still going to have the downsides of having to go off of the device up to the cloud it might take a bit longer if you're in an area with terrible internet might not work at all but in the chance that this is like a big complex thing that could benefit from those models that's what it'll try to do but the other is when you specifically ask it for something
that chat GPT would be good at and if that happens then it will specifically ask you hey is it cool if I ask chat GPT for an answer to this question and then you can give it a yes or no on the spot so anytime it wants to do this whether it's to upload a photo that you're asking something about or just a complex prompt in general then this little dialogue box pops up and you have to say yes every time and then you can tap into everything that open AI model is capable of or generate even more realistic or
varied random different styles of images that Apple's diffusion models would never make this is all free without an account um at no point is open aai allowed to ever store any of these requests and Apple has also said that they will obscure your IP address so you can't even open AI can't even connect multiple requests together to form a profile of you there's just a lot of thought that's gone into ideally making this as secure and private of a version of going to the cloud for AI features as
they possibly can so yeah it's really interesting a lot of interesting stuff going on here I think my overall take with a lot of this WWDC announcements and with the the Apple intelligence stuff is that first of all is that like the Humane pin and the rabbit R1 they were so doomed from the start like there's no even if they were good up to this point there's just no way they could be as good as this stuff on your phone with all the personalization all the info that they
already know about you so I guess that's confirmed but also it's it just kind of it does feel like we've entered a new age with apple I think the AI stuff is so important that it very much is what we're most interested in and it overshadows like honestly what what could possibly be your favorite non- aai feature from the past couple things moving home screen apps and icons everywhere like that might be the biggest thing but it's up to this point now all about what this intelligent
stuff can actually do for you and what it can bring you so that's what I'm really excited about I'll be working on some videos very soon about a lot of this stuff so definitely like I said get subscribed if you haven't already but this has been your overview your what you need to know thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
