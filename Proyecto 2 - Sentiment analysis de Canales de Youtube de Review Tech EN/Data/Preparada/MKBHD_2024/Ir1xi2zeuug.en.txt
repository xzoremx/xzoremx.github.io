okay so there were rumors there were serious rumors that the 10th Generation Apple watch was going to be the one that gets this huge redesign like remember the iPhone 10 that sort of reset the design language of the whole iPhone line and 10 is just such a it's a nice round even number right so we just kind of figured that maybe the Apple watch would do the same thing and I even remember in my last few years of reviewing the APPA Watch series 8 series 9 I was like look these are good watches but clearly very
incremental improvements so if you want a big upgrade maybe wait till the 10th gen one and so now here we are I've been using Apple Watch series 10 for the past week and it's it's it's definitely another incremental upgrade now you know that's not necessarily A Bad Thing obviously it's not as exciting as a total redesign but that definitely makes this review pretty simple as far as whether you should get one or not the main physical differences this time on the outside are
it's slightly thinner and lighter and bigger so the numbers say 10% thinner and 10% lighter for the aluminum one and then they actually drop stainless steel in favor of titanium on the higher end ones so that's 20% lighter and the screens of both sizes are now even bigger and the result is really just that you can see more and it's just more comfortable on the wrist in fact it actually just feels like someone took last year's Apple watch and just squashed it down a little bit and there
you go that's the new design and of course it's more complicated than that like there is a new metal back that's one piece now and there's a new re-engineered speaker that's 30% smaller so it can fit in this and just other pieces like shuffled around to fit in this new shape but the end result is very much still an incremental update instead of some dramatic new form factor I actually think now this visually reminds me more than ever of a pixel watch just depending on what face you
have just because of the way the top edges are curved even more and the way everything just kind of melts into the sides especially with this new jet black color it's just way bigger in fact it's true the larger 46 mm Apple Watch series 10 basically now runs the same screen size as the Apple watch Ultra and apple loves to do that thing where they show an older watch on the screen and then the newer watch with a bigger screen next to it and brag about how hey there's a bigger screen so you can get
even more text and even more content on the screen and it's easier to type on that on-screen keyboard and to be honest it never really made that much of a big difference to me other than maybe the ultra but this year I noticed something very specific the dis sports workout now shows one extra line of information so instead of time active calories total calories and heart rate it now shows me time active calories total calories heart rate and Miles so there's that I think watch OS 11 literally just adds an
extra line of text in some instances with these bigger screens which is kind of funny but speaking of watchos 11 that that Launches on these new watches and gets pushed as a software update to some older Apple watches so you're going to get things like the new vitals app which gives you a sort of energy score kind of like the Garmin body battery and there's a sleep apnea detection which just got FDA approval to detect and notify you of potentially high levels of sleep apnea
using only the accelerometer and there's training load as well which keeps track of the perceived intensity of workouts that stuff is nice and it's also like I said coming to some older Apple watches as well so if you really want to know what stuff is specifically coming just to this newest watch so like a reason to get this one then there's about four that you should know about okay so let me know if let me know if these are enough to convince you to get this newest watch so number one with this
redesigned speaker you can now listen to Media out loud on the watch so meaning like you could already like take phone calls and set alarms and stuff but now you can literally just play media like music or podcasts or audio books out loud so you could be on a hike and just forget your headphones and just you could be that guy but don't don't be that guy so then number two this is now an updated ltpo 3 display which means it'll go all the way down to 1 Herz instead of 10 HZ so now it can
show the secondhand all the time when the always on display is on because it doesn't take up extra battery plus it has slightly noticeably better off axis viewing angles which actually helps for a watch so you can sort of glance and check the watch and still see it without looking like you're checking your watch so then number three there is a new water temperature sensor so here's the thing I don't know if you can tell by looking at me but I don't really spend too much time around
deep water so I don't have any test results for this particular new sensor but it's there now so great but then number four faster charging so cared about this one turns out so if you use the puck that comes with it this is how you maximize your charging speed you can now get it up to somewhere around 65% from dead in half an hour it's supposed to be 80% actually but we couldn't get it quite that fast but nevertheless the faster charging speed is very welcome and that's it that's the new Big 10th Generation
update there's also a new S10 sip inside which doesn't seem to be noticeably faster or better at anything in the S9 has an improved neural engine but hasn't been enabling anything that the S9 can't do so yeah is that enough and the more I thought about it honestly my take is that now that Apple has called this a redesign like if you watch the keynote they were like this is this is a huge deal this is a big new 10th Generation redesign now that they've done that I'm fairly sure that that means that this is
what the Apple watch is going to look like for the next 5 to 10 more years like like this if this is a real redesign for Apple then we're going to be back to even smaller changes from here on really the only parts of this update that made a big difference at all to me are the larger display and faster charging the larger display for obvious reasons the faster charging is nice especially just cuz if you want to drop it on a charger for a few minutes and get a bunch of use then you can I would
find it even better if I was doing sleep tracking as well but I've mentioned this before I'm not because I'm using the eight sleep for all my sleep tracking metrics and so shout out to eight sleep for sponsoring this portion of the video the eight sleep has been so good to me which is why I'm mentioning it in previous videos and you've already heard about this new one the Pod 4 ultra which can get super cool or super warm to each side of the bed independently but also yeah it's doing that biometric tracking
with 99% accuracy no matter how you're sleeping which I think is actually an advantage over something on the back of your wrist so then you just jump in the app and you can see you know here's the different stages of sleep here I've been waking up in the middle of the night randomly since coming back from Australia's time zone but this is a pretty good night right here you can see heart rate heart rate variability breath rate no snoring which is great and it's helping me get back into my sleep
routine here on the east coast and it can help anyone sleep better honestly so you just add the Pod to your current mattress like a fitted sheet and it automatically cools down or warms up each side of the bed so you can go to eight sleep.com MKBHD and get $350 off pod 4 ultra or 200 bucks off the Pod 4 and then you can also leave your wearable on the nightstand but okay so if you if you have an older Apple Watch series four 5 6 7 and you want a new one then okay yeah this is the upgrade to
get that's like the easiest no-brainer conclusion in the world for this product but I'm going I'm going the extra step as a reviewer and predicting the future of this product and and just based on Apple's language in their presentations I really don't think we're getting any planned big upgrades to this watch for a while which is unfortunate but like all those major features we were thinking about like a a rotating bezel or a circular shape or a meaningful Improvement to the battery any of which
would have been the biggest change to the Apple watch in years we didn't get any of that with this 10 gen redesign so it feels like they're not planning on doing any of it so this is the 10 gen Apple watch and this feels like Apple's big statement of this is the Apple watch it's the squirkle no rotating bezel these are the buttons this is the shape 18 hour battery life over and over again take it or leave it that's it that's the review thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
