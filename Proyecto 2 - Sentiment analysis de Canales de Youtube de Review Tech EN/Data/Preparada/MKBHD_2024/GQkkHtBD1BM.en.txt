I'm curious how accurate the step counters are for various smart watches and so in order to test them I'm just going to wear them all at once and just walk a thousand steps and then see how many each of them is counted so I have an Apple Watch Ultra 2 I've got a Samsung Galaxy watch 3 I've got a pixel Watch 2 and I've got a Garmin Phoenix 7 and just for good measure I've also bought a cheap $9 pedometer from Amazon that I'm going to reset right now one two three four 5 15 16 1 I feel like Mr Beast now 997
998  "1,000 I have some numbers for you from" my small sample size of a th000 pixel Watch 2 is going to be the most accurate as far as arm-based recording don't buy one of these and uh these are pretty good
