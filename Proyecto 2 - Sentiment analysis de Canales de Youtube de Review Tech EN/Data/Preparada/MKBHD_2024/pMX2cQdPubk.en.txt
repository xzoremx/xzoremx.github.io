all right Tim great to see you thanks for spending the time thank you for coming so you had the WWDC keynote today yeah which was really fun to watch it was a whole two hours I want to zoom all the way out because obviously a lot of talk about AI in general yeah and I I'm kind of just left wondering how Apple defines AI in general cuz I know if you ask a regular person you might hear about generative AI chat Bots things like that yeah and these are relatively new additions to Apple's AI portfolio
how do you look at AI as Apple well we've been executing with AI for a long time right uh it's at the you're wearing a watch it's at the root of the watch I mean you think about things like crash detection fall detection things like apib and all of this kind of stuff is machine learning at the end of the day and so but what has captured people's imagination is generative Ai and we see it as the opportunity for a whole new curve of technology and and providing and doing more things for people providing an
assistant for people uh things that really improve people's lives so that's how we see it um there's obviously uh it's not without downside and so we have approach it very thoughtfully sure and uh and as as you heard we we have always been focused on privacy and so privacy is a very key tenant of our thrust into AI right it's been interesting to watch Apple's Arc with AI because I I made a whole piece not more than about a year ago about how Apple seems to never say AI even though
they have all these these neural engines and machine learning and things like that yeah and and so now we have almost this pivot where now we're just saying it we're actually branding it it's Apple intelligence now I'm curious why that change now well the in the in the beginning and throughout almost everything that we always do we always talk about the benefit to the user and so the benefit to the user is Crash detection and fall detection not the technology behind the feature sure and
so we still we we still view it like that but it became clear uh that people wanted to know our views on on generative AI in particular uh and and so we decided to embrace it and uh called it Apple intelligence okay uh I have a quote from I the DU Leia interview that you did was great um it was fun she's fantastic I was I loved it it was great I you had a quote that said uh about AI if it can be used for nefarious things we won't go down that road yeah and at the time I assumed that
that meant generative AI was off the table because of all the things that we'd seen about what it was potentially capable of or things that it might do um has that changed is that something that was off the table and you figure now you've got the right tools or the right restrictions to make sure that that all goes Super well how do you think about that generative AI was never off the table it was always about pursuing it in a thoughtful kind of way and uh and so that that's what we've
done and we've implemented it in ways that are uh less likely to create issues how so uh how so well things that you if you think about the kinds of things that we talked about we talked about uh personal context and we talked about privacy and so we're not waiting for a comprehensive privacy legislation regulation to come into effect we we already view privacy as a fundamental human right and so that's the way we that's the lens that we see it at uh and given that we're doing those things
personal context and privacy we wanted to integrate it at a deep level so you're not having to think oh well now I want to do something that uses intelligence we put it in the apps that you're already using and integrated it deeply right yeah I think also now there's a lot of talk about it now there is generative AI yeah um a lot of people have I mean Apple's notorious for never sending anything to the cloud everything's on device because that is the most secure way to do it and was
applauded for it interestingly this is a little bit different now with a lot of these larger models more complex requests you actually do have to go off device so you've developed want to get the name right private Cloud compute explain this to us cuz I think the The General online is well they have to be sending data to open AI for example to get a request back from chat GPT well there's private CL compute and then there's the uh arrangement with open AI these two things are different okay and
so if you look at private Cloud compute we're utilizing the same silicon or not the same silicon but the same basic architecture as the Silicon that's in the well that's in the iPhone 15 yeah and uh and and we're using the same software and so we we believe that we've done it in such a way that it's as safe and secure and private in the private Cloud compute as the device and so we really we really worked on this a a a lot and put a lot of wood behind that Arrow to to assure
that if you're if you're working on something that requires wh knowledge so you're out of the the domain of personal context and so forth uh then you you may want to go and use one of the large language models that are on the market and we we selected what we feel is the best one with open Ai and chat GPT uh but you'll make a conscious decision to do that every time every time so you you can guarantee that there will never be any data sent to open AI without your explicit user right that's
right you decide right I I also feel like there was this blip on the radar of Standalone AI devices which I found really interesting they didn't land too well I think smartphones are pretty great but there was an interesting conversation around that about using your phone less maybe having AI help you out in ways that let you spend less time on the screen and this is something you echoed also in the doal leap interview like if you're looking at your phone more than you're looking at someone
else's size something's off there yeah do you think there's a potential future where we're using our phones less because of how well the intelligence works I think it's a possibility and a significant possibility I mean for us we've never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices uh our our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed our model is one that where we want to empower you to to be able to do things you couldn't do otherwise we want to give you a tool so
you can do incredible things uh that you couldn't do without the tool that that's what motivates us and and so we you know we come out with things like screen time Etc so it's a bit in your face as to how much you're using your device uh we come out with we count your notifications and so forth so that you can go in and say do I really want this many notifications and and we have Focus uh kinds of states where you can silence the the phone Etc and so I I do believe that as things get smarter and
smarter with apple intelligence that you can even take things that we're taking more time will take less time now right and uh and so I do think that opportunity exists interesting yeah it's a curious future it is it it is and I and I think a really I'm really optimistic about it yeah I also I feel like there was tons of chatter when you were first CEO of Apple about this new shift obviously coming from Steve Jobs and you've been CEO for for it feels like a long time now and we're entering this new age of
AI and I'm curious now now there's new chatter about who whose next CEO is going to be what do you feel like your your legacy as CEO at Apple should be yeah marz I don't think about it okay and so to to me a legacy is something that is uh defined by other people looking at you not something that you define yourself very fair and and so I and I typically am always focused on the forward not the rearview Mir and that's that is a characteristic of Apple in general is we're very focused
on the forward you you won't find a museum here and yet we would have lots of things that you might like to see and and reminisce about but we just don't it's just not a part of our culture yeah and and so I feel the same way personally uh at some point there will be another CEO and uh and and my whole focus in life will on will be on making them successful yeah I like that answer it's very LeBron answer I feel like he said that things yeah uh all right I want to end with a little game uh I
don't know if you've seen these where a blind ranking have you seen what these are a blind ranking blind ranking so we're going to do a top five Apple products of all time but I'm going to give you them one at a time and you don't know what the rest of them are so you have to rank the first one without knowing what 2 3 four and five are oh and this is your ranking this will be your unofficial ranking just based on your gut reaction of how you feel about the know this is a tough one because it
a tough one it's like asking you your favorite kids or nephews or nieces and we'll see how it goes yeah okay number one MacBook Air it had that iconic moment of like taking it out the envelope on stage it's the most popular laptop in the world I think it's the most popular in the world and that moment of taking it out of the folder uh established a characteristic about that device that lives today the the first one it wasn't about how many people would buy it yeah uh it was about
establishing the foundation was that the first air that was that was uh of any line yeah you might have been I believe so yes okay I believe so and so I I'm going to fail miserably at giving you a ranking but it was a huge moment yeah a huge moment for the company the iPad oh wow you know uh tablets had been in the market for a long time our objective is never to be first our objective is to be best I remember all the rumors leading up to it and there were many rumors leading up to it and
and uh people thought uh many things that weren't too nice about it in the in the beginning including the name uh and and yet I couldn't live without my iPad today yeah and uh and and so another huge moment for the for the company my number three is the Magic Mouse The Magic Mouse uh it was also an incredible moment um people don't think of that as much as they would the MacBook Air and the iPad and whatever else you're going to name probably uh but the getting the ergonomics well done and uh was key with
Magic Mouse yeah okay four out of five the iPhone oh my God it changed the world it definitely changed the world it changed the world and and uh the the Simplicity of defining the three things yeah that were that were the on the phone was brilliant to get people to think about it like that and of course opening up this isn't talked about as much but initially you'll remember that there was not an app store right the App Store came a year later and that changed everything in the developer
Community uh because now now I meet with uh students every WWDC and they give me such great inspiration there were no students in the developer community at that particular point in time now they're the developer population is very diverse from an age point of view and everything else and uh it it it just fundamentally it it became an economic miracle for people and uh and got well outside of just doing it for a hobby it it was or you look at all the businesses that that came out of it yeah and now we
have WWDC that's right last but not least Vision Pro oh I I uh I love Vision Pro I was just using it last night to look at the a screening yeah what do you use Vision Pro for I asked everybody who has one what they use it for I use it for uh the entertainment uh value I use it when I want to do multitasking because I find the multiple windows really effective in in doing this um of course I'm reviewing lots of apps on it right now and some of those are Enterprise apps some some people's
proprietary apps that they want to share with us and and I'm seeing an extraordinary uh number and variety of things coming out of the Enterprise area far earlier than we would have predicted interesting because businesses generally move slow to adopt yeah and and what we're seeing is that half of the Fortune 100 is now buying Vision Pro for some project or the other or exploring it and uh and so I I I'm looking at several of those and uh yeah I I I find that it's still an emotional experience to look at
your photos and with vision os2 being able to take your old photos yeah and make them 3D I think is a big big thing yeah and you know I lost both of my parents and before Vision Pro came out and being able to go back and look at those photos differently is yeah is something that you know it's it's an experience you can't replicate for sure well we didn't get a blind ranking but we got a pretty good retrospective of some of these products thanks again for the time looking forward to the next uh next
feature drops in the next dub du but uh this was fun thank you yeah it was great fun thank you for coming thanks for having me oh
