all right we have a new Contender for I think the most tech I've ever seen in a single vehicle this is the Lee Auto Mega very deserving of the name two 15.7 in OLED touch screens dual 50 W wireless chargers you drop the key here in here there's USBC ports for charging and one to record for your Sentry mode which is your dash cam and security camera there's no screen back here but there is an HUD I can see and there's also a screen on the steering wheel which has your drive mode selector and these seats
are heated cooled and Mass but the second row is really where you want to be so You' got these two jetliner style seats super comfortable heated cooled and massaging again it also has this personal 50 W wireless charger for your phone there's a cup holder right in there if you want it there's also this drop down OLED display that is gesture controlled so if I just go like this you can see a cursor appear here on the screen and then I can move stuff around which is awesome I can also put stuff on
the front screen and there happens to be a refrigerator down here heated or cooled put whatever you want in there there's also a spacious third row back here with more leg room than a long wheelbase 5 series also with USB type-c and heated seats and cup holders and there's 21 speakers in this whole cabin with the the atmos and I think if you put an Apple logo on the front of this car it could fool some people this is a fully electric three row minivan shape it has a 350 Mi range 520 Kow charging
and that makes it the fastest charging vehicle in the world 10 to 80% in 10 minutes so this whole shape is really really smooth to be aerodynamic obviously but it still has features down here at the bottom are the headlights but then it's got this uninterrupted light bar which is their signature Halo and at the top is the lar sensors which are good for the cruise control and some of the best auto park I've ever seen and the whole thing rides on their magic carpet air suspension which is the
smoothest I have ever felt that's including the Rolls-Royce it's incredible
