what are we okay with this so Boston Dynamics just unveiled their new Atlas robot after they retired the old one after 10 years and I I think they just thought what's the creepiest way we can unveil this insane new robot I've watched this so many times obviously it's Slimmer and smoother and it like walks faster but why did it have to have like 360Â° arms and hips and stuff like that I I'm actually kind of glad it doesn't have a human face the human face would make this weird it's more like a Pixar
lamp face humanid robots man wow
