I think Google might have done it the only reason I hesitate is because I've had this exact same feeling and said this same line before about like the pixel 6 but Google's phones have always been all about software and we just want them to get their Hardware over the hump to have a complete competitive phone but I I think I think they did it so Google had their pixel 9 event today and there's actually a bit more than just a pixel shown off there's also new watch and new pixel Buds and I'll get to
those but I just want to focus this video on the new phones because I've been waiting for these for a while so there's several phones there's the pixel 9 pixel 9 Pro then the pixel 9 Pro XL and then a pixel 9 Pro fold now some people are saying the names are a bit confusing honestly it's it's not really that bad except maybe the fold but the base phone the pixel 9 is $7.99 and with that you get the 6.3in screen size and it has this new design with the flat matte metal sides and a Polish glass
back in four colors porcelain is white obsidian is black and then winter green and pey kind of Cosmo and Wanda Vibes and then there's the two pro phones so the pixel 9 pro and pro XL so what's sick is the 9 Pro it's the exact same size as the pixel 9 just like what the iPhone's been doing and the only thing that's different about the XL is it's just bigger just a bigger 6.8 in screen and a bigger battery but yeah the pro phones start at $9.99 and $10.99 and with that you'll get an extra third
camera telephoto camera they have more RAM and they switch to glossy rails with a soft touch glass back again in four colors obsidian porcelain Hazel which looks nice and rose quartz kind of a more faded pink so I got to handle these phones for like 2 hours and the entire time right from the beginning I was like oh wow yes Okay Google's done it these phones really feel and look like actual flagships and it's not just because the these days is to do flat sides like obviously I've talked about how I like
that but that's not the only thing they feel a little bit heavier in the hand now which gives them a more solid feel the screens are all much brighter so the pixel 99's actua display is 35% brighter than the pixel 8 and there's thinner bezels all the way around and yes finally it's an ultrasonic fingerprint reader under the display not Optical and the camera visor around the back uh this is polarizing but the huge lens opening I think it just looks promising now of course course I'm going to have to test
all these things for the full review and really see what they're made of so get subscribed to see that but my first impression at least is that you know these photos are going to end up very pixel-like very Punchy and contrasty and they're just bigger sensors than before so potentially more shallow depth of field but I guess aesthetically the camera bump even though I like the older ones better I still kind of don't mind these new ones I know it's not the full visor all the way around like before and
I missed that but it's now this like perfectly flat Island and that is still distinctive it's it's pretty unique as like a pixel thing so now specs let's just get them all in one place there that's all the specs that I've been able to confirm uh you'll notice all these phones across the board all the new pixels have the same tensor G4 chip so that's the new chip is more powerful they're saying and more efficient and should have dramatically better AI capabilities obviously it's a pixel but
we'll get there but also notice it's the exact same primary camera and ultrawide Camera between the base phone and the pro phone so again I've talked about this with pixel before and it's you know it makes the lowest price one look like a great deal but there's not a lot of Hardware difference between the base phone and the pro phone and it's a $200 difference this year but for that in the Pro phone what do you get maybe a slightly better screen a telephoto camera more RAM and a better selfie camera that's
kind of it now again I don't want to make the mistake of judging it too soon because I haven't benchmarked it and I don't know what long-term performance is like but but when Google says tensor 20% faster with web browsing and 177% faster with app launching I believe them I mean these phones are really quick and snappy at least for my impression and I just want to say again that I'm really glad they made the smaller phone with all the benefits of the pro because there are a
lot of people who want a better phone but not a gigantic phone so having a pro that's not a pro Max is sick but of course these would not be pixel phones without a boatload of AI and so there are definitely some new AI features coming along with these pixel 99's the big ones are the new weather app the new screenshots app and pixel studio so the Google Weather app has been redesigned for the pixel 99's as you can see which is a bunch of tiles now and this very you know modern looking version of the
weather and right at the top is an AI generated comment about the weather maybe sometimes telling you what to wear or something cool I guess I almost never use the stock weather app on any phone and that probably won't change here but for those who do all right fine that's a good Improvement the new screenshots app is interesting again I don't think many people are going to use this but if you do it's basically a new app that gathers all of your screenshots specifically in
one place and then it scans each one of them for any information in them to be able to remind you later or help you search through later but then there's the pixel studio app which I guess that's the hot new thing in devices with AI is to have an app called Studio that just lets you create AI generated art on device with a simple text prompt Apple's just announced that in iOS 18 but they're not shipping that yet but the one thing I was impressed with playing with this one is it's really quick like
maybe 3 seconds or so to generate a new image and it's completely on device so it'll still be this fast when your internet connection sucks or offline or something like that so yeah I don't know maybe you're generated pictures or memes for text conversations or for Twitter or something like that but yeah it's another AI app on the phone also mag magic editor in photos has this new reimagine feature where you can not only erase things or reframe things in your pictures but you can now highlight a
section and reimagine it as something and it can be whatever you type just something completely different so I guess you can straight up make up new scenes and pictures now that totally didn't happen kind of like Samsung's sketch to image what is going on what is a picture maybe the best what is a photo feature is this new one in the camera again built right in called add me and it's actually I think pretty impressive I played I got to use it once and you're about to see exactly me using
it once but basically if you ever have a group of people and you want to take a group shot but you don't have anyone else who could take the group shot for you okay no problem the add me feature walks you through this so okay first you open the camera mode and it tells you to kind of Wiggle the camera around a little bit so it can get a better sense of 3D space in the environment then the photograph number one takes a picture of everyone except for them and leaves a little room for themselves then once
they take that they can have everybody peace out and then one of those other people becomes the new photographer and tells the first person where to pose so that they can sort of be next to everyone else it overlays where the people were and a nice white box over the scene to help keep the framing the same once the second person poses they snap the picture and Google straight up merges the pictures together into a group for photo with everyone another moment that totally never happened plus
it keeps the originals too very 2024 what is a photo there's some other things like uh better clear calling uh call notes which can summarize phone calls that you're on for you uh Gemini live which is like having literal conversations with the assistant called Gemini it's still confusing um but generally I was most excited about the hardware of these phones and then there's the folding phone so this is the pixel 9 Pro fold I don't know why it's called that I don't know why it's not
just called the pixel fold 2 maybe it's easier to remember cuz now they're all nines but whatever they added Pro to the name for some reason but it's a fold and the point is it's dramatically improved from the pixel fold that came last year and it's the same price $17.99 so look Google cooked with this thing I think the last fold I was constantly calling the best foldable to use closed which is kind of a half compliment but it's true this new one has an even bigger screen
it's 6.3 in so right now it's about the size of the other base pixel 9 and it's still reachable because the bezels are all pretty thin the whole phone is thin all the way around and it's also much brighter it's 80% brighter than the last fold and then on the inside it's also a larger 8in display that like I said it mirrors the home screen layout of the cover display and the whole phone with the metal rails now and the soft touch matte glass it just all feels even more premium like of a flagship than ever
before and look at how thin this thing is this has got to be I mean it's definitely one of the thinnest foldables out now maybe not the thinnest but each side is barely thicker than a USBC port and so combined with the flat sides it's barely thicker than a normal phone now of course it still has this camera bump on the back which is okay this one's worse I I don't see a lot of thoughtful design in this camera Island but I feel like I can accept it with the rest of this phone's design being so impressive
it's just so good it feels great to use open it's awesome closed I feel like this is just a better version of the previous best foldable the OnePlus open of course still TBD on battery life and camera quality with these new cameras that are different from the main pixel 99's but you know my general first impression is clearly pretty positive it also of course has the tensor G4 16 gigs of RAM and all the AI benefits that come from these pixels pixel Studio screenshot app weather app all that
other pixel stuff it is also ipx8 rated so it can probably take a splash um and Google also mentioned that they're partnering with some number of developers to optimize some games for the interior screen so looking forward to see what those end up being and it also comes in two colors porcelain white and obsidian black so I think consider me highly interested I've you know I've kind of been off the foldables train for my own daily driver for a while I've gone back to dailying slab phones but I
think this pixel 9 Pro fold has a chance uh to get me back to being a foldable user if that outer screen remains just as usable as any other phone and the bonus is a gigantic 8 in screen whenever I want it it's one of the biggest displays literally ever in a phone so these phones feel for now like they've actually achieved the modernized glow up that we've been hoping for from Google's flagship phone maybe ch2 is the only thing missing that I'm actually bummed about that I can see on the spec sheet
but of course as promised it's not just the phones there's also a couple other gadgets so the new pixel watch 3 has basically the same design but now comes in two sizes there's a new larger 45 mm size that gets you like 40% more screen and the bezel is also a little bit smaller so these screens are also a lot "brighter 2,000 nits and there's a new" body score feature which it seems like everyone suddenly decided to copy from Garmin this year but that will sort of summarize all of your metrics into one
score at the top and there's also some new running features as well potentially the biggest change is the new dual chip architecture to give you even longer battery life they're saying up to 36 hours in battery saver which isn't exactly pushing the industry limit but it should be better than last year and same price $3.49 for the small one $3.99 for the big one and then there's the new pixel buds so the pixel buds Pro 2 which at this point are kind of like Gemini buds so they updated the design to be a
bit smaller as you can see just these little bud things with no stocks there's a little tiny stabilizer fin to keep it in your ear hopefully sometimes it doesn't work with my ears but I'll try and then there's a new custom designed A1 chip based on tensor that improves active noise cancellation improves overall sound quality and also let's you have a back and forth conversation with Gemini live just a straight up out loud back and forth convo with an assistant I will definitely be getting my hands on
these to test but definitely let me know what you're most interested in for the full reviews of these things I'm planning on getting my hands on as many as possible get subscribed to see this stuff but is it the AI features or is it the new camera stuff is it the new hardware which I think looks pretty sick let me know in the comments section below now a few years back I put up a poll on Twitter asking how many of you use a case on your phone and like 34 of you guys said you
do and I guess that actually makes a lot of sense and phones have gotten more expensive since then so I can't blame you so if you're thinking of picking one up I definitely recommend checking now the grip case from Channel sponsor dbrand it's kind of the whole package it comes in matte black it's super grippy it has clicky buttons and it adds those nice strong magnets and yes obviously also super protective so I'll leave a link down below if you want to check it out either way that's been it thanks for
watching catch you guys in the next one
