so this is the Apple watch Ultra it was added in at the top of the Apple watch lineup for an extra premium price kind of as an excuse to pack a much bigger battery in a smartwatch but also to offer a few extra ruggedized features for enthusiasts willing to spend the extra money now this is the Samsung Galaxy watch Ultra and it was added to the top of the Galaxy watch lineup for an extra premium price kind of as an excuse to pack a much bigger battery into a smartwatch but also to offer a
few extra rized features for enthusiasts willing to spend the money now look there have been many copies before in both directions like Samsung copies Apple all the time and apple copies Samsung all the time but this one is so far that it's it's it's hard to ignore so there's been a lot of chatter online about how the new Galaxy watch Ultra is a copycat product of the Apple watch Ultra and yeah yeah it's true it really is but I've said this before and I'll say it again I actually don't care that
these products and companies copy each other as long as they're copying the good stuff then you know us as customers we actually still win this one copied so many things that it actually went slightly too far and copied one extra thing that I think hurt its case so let's just let's just go down the list so first of all obviously they had the same name and the whole idea of the product as I mentioned before this is the watch Ultra it's at the top of the lineup it's the most expensive and of
course they've matched the Apple watch ultra's durability specs so they're both made of titanium they're both water resistant to 100 m they both have sapphire glass over their cover displays and then the other basic onp paper specs like they both have dual frequency GPS for high accuracy they both have extra bright displays for visibility Outdoors "so actually both 3,000 nits and then" they both have three default bands so the Apple watch Ultra has an Ocean band a Trail Loop and an Alpine band so now
Along Comes Samsung's watch Ultra and they launch with three bands they don't have an ocean band though they have a Marine band totally different and then they have a trail band and then they have this Peak form band so yeah The Ocean band and the Marine band are kind of like hey can I copy your homework but change it up just a little bit so it's not too obvious that I copied and they kind of didn't change up enough but it's like okay yeah sweet thanks now we have two holes on ours instead of one and
everybody knows not every Marine is an ocean duh but each watch has three buttons and you may remember the Apple watch added this special orange button on the side called the action button that you could map to any number of different things but you know it starts the workout selector by default now the Galaxy watch Ultra comes along has a new orange button on the side this one is called the quick button and it can be also custom mapped to any number of different actions but the default again
is a workout selector now don't worry it keeps going in the software department they also lifted a whole bunch of stuff so you know this this watch face that we keep seeing Samsung using and all of their Flagship marketing for this thing with all the complications around the outside corners definitely takes heavy inspiration from Apple's Flagship watch face with the complications everywhere it also has an all monochrome version for night mode which was also new to the Apple watch Ultra and if you want to
change the watch face they both have the same mechanic just hold down the face for for a second and then swipe over and you can customize the complications or watch faces from there they both use a blob of icons to scroll through all of your apps and even the double pinch gesture so this is something Apple recently added it was in beta at first and now it's operational and Samsung's added it now too it's off by default but when I turn it on it does the exact same things so yeah as you can tell there's
no shortage of things that Samsung Has Lifted from the Apple watch Ultra people are calling it Shameless people are calling it pure copycat Behavior there's endless comments online about it here's the thing though there's only one thing that Samsung copied that I actually have a problem with with this watch like when you just look at this watch you can definitely argue it actually looks mostly different from the Apple watch I mean I know they both have the orange button but they've done this kind of
unique thing where it's still a fully circular watch face but then it's a much bigger bronny circle shaped titanium body underneath like call it cushion design that's at least different you know I don't know if I actually like it more but it feels definitively bigger than the Apple watch Ultra which was already pretty big but in the grand scheme of watches it's not actually huge especially because the size of the screen is basically the same as a large watch 7 anyway I thought that with
keeping this circular screen they would have a physically rotating bezel like a clicking bezel on the outside because that that was the sickest feature on the watch 6 classic and it's the feature everyone wanted in all the other watches but they just didn't do it this watch though is just pure touchscreen for everything which might not seem like that big of a deal at first but this is again this is a watch for Fitness people doing a lot of workouts and things like that and if you've used watches in all
these workout situations before then you know like there are endless situations where like sweat or your sleeve is messing with the touchcreen or if you're you've got gloves on or if you're hiking or you're underwater or swimming whatever there's just plenty of chances for the touchcreen to suck so the rotating Crown to use as a selector to mess with the watch would have been a banger differentiator for this Fitness watch versus the Apple watch Ultra but they didn't do it now I'm guessing if
you asked Samsung they would say no rotating bezel on this watch because that's a moving part and that wouldn't have held up to the military grade certification of the rest of the watch like it's got this 810h grade military certification where it's like it can withstand even tougher drops and like more dust and wider range of temperatures and all that stuff so the moving part wouldn't have worked with that but honestly Samsung I think just do it anyway just go with the rotating
bezel I think 99% of users would rather have the rotating bezel over the military certification and you know the 1% who don't like they'll get a Garin or whatever something different but I think this is something that would have actually been a great match with this particular watch now there's a few other things now that I've used it that do differentiate this watch too obviously it's going to be the one that works with Android phones and not iPhones that's number one but you know we OS performs
really well I know there was some early concerns about it not being super smooth but it's been great it's very customizable very functional the full-size keyboard is actually a bit easier to type on despite having a bigger screen because they make the letters bigger and then you have to go into a secondary menu for symbols but I actually feel like I can type words pretty well on this versus other SmartWatches and I think best of all the battery life has actually lived up to
its claims so sometimes it's hard to know what to make of the you know 60 hours versus 100 hours in power saving mode or 48 hours and exercise power saving mode it's kind of confusing but what I will say is it matched and sometimes beat the battery life of the Apple watch Ultra like pretty regularly I felt like it has about a 25% better standby time so if you have light use you're just casually like getting text messages doing one or two workouts you can easily get two full days out of this
watch and then if you're going heavy if it's a bunch of workouts then it's closer to even but still a solid day and a half especially when you're using that "3,000 nits super amola display a lot" that's impressive so yeah it's it's pretty clear that Samsung has copied a lot of features and things about the Apple watch Ultra but as I've kept saying if you copy the good stuff then you can still end up with a great product no matter how Shameless it is but the conclusion about this one is is
kind of funny because Apple or Samsung also updated the watch 7 at the same time and that watch also has dual frequency GPS the screen is the same size even though it's a smaller battery it's still got sapphire crystal on top it's got three sporty bands and it's like half the price so that ends up making this one feel harder to recommend mend if it's so similar so this just ends up being a Galaxy watch for people who want that but with a bigger battery and I guess just a little more
ruggedized features and that's kind of it and you have $650 you're willing to spend on it so I think the rotating bezel would have been easier to justify and like separate them but yeah for now this is one of those Samsung products that's a little more Shameless in its inspiration and it won't won't be the last one from either side thanks for watching catch you guys
