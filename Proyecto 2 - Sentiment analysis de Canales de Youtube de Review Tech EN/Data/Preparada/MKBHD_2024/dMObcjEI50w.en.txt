Hey listen if you're ever having a bad day if you're ever feeling um really undervalued or useless I just want you to know that you'll never feel less valued than the rear view mirror of the Lamborghini Heron stado hear me out this is the off-road version of this car it's got a ton of modifications to it allterrain tires it's lifted by 2 in a roof rack with a spare tire with a run flat it's great but part of being off-road means they've moved the air intake higher off the
ground so if you drive through water or mud or whatever there's a a roof scoop here all of your air still goes under your engine no matter what you're driving in that means when you get in this car behind you is the roof scoop the air intake so why is why is this here why is this not a camera it's just showing me it's just showing me nothing this is useless you'll never be this useless you'll never be this useless
