all right it's finally here this is this is the Apple Vision Pro this this is the beginning of Apple's spatial Computing Journey their first headset AR VR wearable face computer whatever you want to call it and this is the unboxing so everything that I show you guys in this box it's going to be a representation of what you would get should you decide to spend the $3500 that it takes to get one of these "or in this case actually $3,900 because" this is the 1 tbte Vision Pro you'll see
the accessories you'll see it booted up for the first time and this is very much the beginning of our uh Apple Vision Pro investigation and series of videos so definitely get subscribed to make sure you're among the first to see that when the rest of those come out so big box but the headset is relatively small   inside this is a really soft box  box so this is an incredibly flimsy box but I'll just take this one out so the three things we have now are the Vision Pro headset in this box The Vision Pro
Zeiss lenses so these are Optical inserts so if you have a prescription then these come in the box and they will magnetically attach to the headset so if you wear glasses you can still use the headset and this is the optional $200 extra vision Pro travel case this thing this is a whole aesthetic I'll get you that in a second I'm just going to leave that right here but this is the headset itself it's going to slide  this there we go so this is like the size of I mean it's bigger than a Mac
Box this might be bigger than the Mac Studio box but there you go and it's got all the pull tabs I do expect pretty good uh packaging here this is such a high pressure first gen product for Apple so I'm expecting pretty good packaging for this introduction to a first gen thing take the tabs  off then it's like like a shoe box okay so there's the headset so the headset comes with this little cover on it and it's dressed up with one of these bands this band right here is the one
that you see in all the commercials it's this really soft stretchy fabric material and it's in this sort of cardboard head this is the solo knit band there's another band though that I'm pretty sure comes with this that is called the Dual Loop band so put this the side real quick and see what else comes in this like shoe box size box so this pops off this quality and then we're in to the inside which is a design by Apple in California pamphlet oh I bet there's stickers in here oh there's a microfiber
too okay then there is the light seal cushion oh I think you get two of these yeah there's one Thin light seal and one thick light seal I'll get to that in a second and at the top there's a lot of explaining to do some more heavy Vision Pro paperwork and this is the Dual Loop band so this is the second band that goes both around the back of your head and over the top of your head we'll try that out for Comfort over the solo knit band and then there's your power so the battery that comes with The Vision Pro
is this thing right here it's all very white everything in this box is either  heavy so this smells pretty new it's got this uh White braided cable and I don't know if Apple's even called this mag safe but at the end of this cable is one proprietary connector right there and that connector is what plugs into the side of the headset and this is the battery the 2 and 1/2 to 3 hour battery that comes with Vision Pro it says on the back actually "3,166 Mah" hours I know a lot of phones that have
"5,000 Mah batteries that feel much" lighter than this so I'm curious why this feels so heavy but that's the battery and then in order to get more than 2 and a half hours or to charge the battery you have the cable USBC and the wall brick so let's see what the wall brick says I hope it charges fast 30 WTS so not super fast but this is a 30 wat brick USB type-c and then a ctoc braided cable okay that's it for the inside of this box so now let's go over these accessories so okay let's do
the paperwork first this is probably the most common stuff everyone's going to get this this is a little booklet of what's in the box and a sort of a first and that is all the uh pairing it to your iPhone putting it on for the first time connecting the straps I'll show you guys this oh and even how to store the cable around the battery so apparently you do not want to wrap it vertically but you do want to wrap it horizontally with a little bit of slack okay I bet there's I bet there's
stickers so polishing cloth and that is a different polishing cloth to the one that comes with their monitors oh it's nice and thin that's a nice that's a nice polishing cloth people were comparing it to the like $20 polishing cloth for the studio display and the pro display this is a different polishing cloth the front of it is glass you're probably going to want to use this to wipe it down once in a while so I feel like this is a microfiber I'll keep I know some people unboxing this who are
going to be very disappointed in the lack of Vision Pro themed stickers all right so when you buy an Apple Vision Pro everyone actually has to go through a sort of a face scanning process you actually use the iPhone with the face ID sensors to measure the depth and scan around your eyes and your face and you end up with a custom fitted light seal the light seal cushion is either thin or thick so maybe you have the optical inserts and you want it a little further from your face or you just want a little
extra cushion this would be the thicker cushion that you would use okay so there you go that's the thicker cushion but the idea is the light seal around Vision Pro is shaped to roughly match your face it's not like exactly custom molded it's more that they have a preset number of different sizes and shapes and when you do the scan it picks the one that matches you the best to give you the best immersion let's take the plastic or the cardboard off of Vision Pro and uh huh sort of a standard head size I
guess right there and if we take this protective off the first time dang there's your glass lot of lights in this room so it's going to be pretty reflective but now you can probably imagine why people are going to carry this Vision Pro cloth notice it says Vision Pro on the microfiber hopefully you can see that but yeah so when you get the headset you're going to notice two things one this is the thicker version this thinner version pops off and and two this light seal this is the
custom light seal that pops off and then you're just left with this this is the Entire Computer for Apple Vision Pro it's pretty small it's not unlike a lot of other VR headsets but it's got this aluminum housing around the outside you can see the tons of sensors and glass and it is very front weighted this light seal is what's ideally shaped to match your face and block the light out it attaches just like um airpods max you've seen airpods Max headphone covers just like that there
you go and I'm going to go with the thin light seal cushion and there's the the normal look to the Vision Pro headset now let's take uh the Dual Loop band out because this is the other one that there's been a lot of talk about the weight of the Vision Pro and this is the reason why Apple has decided to include two bands in the Box there are different band sizes as well so when you measure your head you're either getting a small medium or large size for your bands so I've got mediums
of both of these for this dual Loop let's take it out so you can see so much cardboard uh there's two Loops one over your head and one behind your head so there's a very specific process to taking off and attaching these bands with Vision Pro so I'm going to put this on for the first time without booting it up just so you can see how this works so this is the solo band right here kind of goes around the back of your head and then if I'm in the right yep this spot right here this you just 
this and it tightens it up yeah and the weight is really basically just now pulling it onto the front of your face all the weight is on the front and it kind of lands on your cheeks and on your forehead this is how it looks in all the commercials it's the most simple looking band you can pull the band up or down to kind of adjust the way it sits on your head but as you can probably already tell that might get a little uncomfortable so to take this band off and switch to the other one all you got
to do is you see this uh this orange pull tab in here this orange pull tab is just to release the band from The Vision Pro so if I pull that it clicks the metal and I pull that other one and it just pops right off and that's the uh headset without the band attached to it and you have these little little pods here over each ear which are a bunch of speaker drivers pointing down into your ear these are some seriously small components they're so dense though like this is heavy
despite being small so if you want to put the other band on it's basically exactly as you'd expect attaches like that and like that and now you can uh change it with velcro you can make it taller in the top taller in the back so let's try it let's try taller in the top and taller in the back well that's so much more well distributed and I happen to adjust it pretty close to my head pretty much perfectly that is going to be much easier to wear for longer but of course now you have this thing across the top
of your head so not everybody's G to like that but I think it's immediately a better fit it's more comfortable wow okay I'm probably going to be using that more often but let's get to this uh this travel case so this I guess isn't really a travel case as much as it's just like a protective outer layer for the glass since this whole outside which has a ton of fingerprints already is just covered in glass you might want to just pop it in here and then theoretically you can maybe put that in a backpack I don't
know if you would want to but this is this is the external extra Vision Pro travel case it's got this handle on the top oh and it extends out a little bit that's nice that's well thought nice and tight  then it opens up and it's got sort of molding in the places that you'd put the headset so this is where the battery will go and it's even got this molded uh spot for the cable so I can slide that in there velcro it down and the cable should be able to just wrap in here then the other side 
case and then it says this is where your oh accessory pouch so this is where you put polishing cloth power brick and USBC  makes sense keep them in there activated carbon deodorizer do not eat then you put the headset in here put the accessories in there and close it up that's actually pretty solid I know people were making fun of the price of the $200 uh Vision Pro accessory case but the thing is I wouldn't want to travel with this without the case and I do think people are going to want to travel
with this the number one use case I've been looking forward to with Vision Pro is uh airplanes so I'm going to need a pretty big backpack to have extra room for all of this but I do think I'm going to be trying that let's uh let's boot it up for the first time let's get it all set up so this is what you'll have to do when you get out Vision Pro ready open the case get your battery out first the battery has a special cable on the end get your headset out maybe take off your
knit cap or whatever this is called Pi between your thick or thin light seel cover I'll go thin pick between your dual Loop or your solo knit band I'll go solo knit and then if you want to charge it up or plug it straight into the wall the battery doesn't appear to have a removable cable I'm sure some Apple store has some tool to remove this cable whenever they need to replace it but what it does have is a USBC port on the side so if ever want to just plug the headset straight into the wall wall I'm
plugging the battery straight into the wall but assuming it's charged the last step here is to go to the left side of the headset and you see this little proprietary circular thing right here all I'm going to do is line up the dot with the bottom and then twist and it'll start to Glow just like that and that means it's starting up for the first time takes about a minute to boot up and then I'll go right into the setup process which I'm sure you'll all want to see on   boox how do I
look ridiculous do I look great or ridiculous decent okay I can see you guys so there's a little hello script and it's booting up for the first time but I'm going to save this all this setup and all of this using Vision Pro that's going to be the next video so last thing I'm going to show you is the Zeiss lenses if you happen to wear glasses or have a prescription you will be able to use this headset as well with that prescription with a $100 pair of Zeiss lenses I think it's 100 bucks for
readers and 150 for prescription lenses but either way they're really really quite small and they're magnetic and since Zeiss runs a world of glass this is kind of your only option is these things right here all you got to do though to attach them is take this off and you grab one of the prescription lenses and you just snap it in place like that hope you can see that it's a pretty strong magnet I do not have a prescription but what I've been told is then you go ahead and scan
this code with the headset so that it knows what your prescription is and adjusts everything accordingly which I think is pretty well thought out but I think that's where I have to end it so stay tuned definitely get subscribed for the following videos CU you already know I got to set this thing up I got to show you guys how to use Vision Pro show you guys what I've been talking about as far as weight distribution the games you can play the experiences you can have the movies you can watch the apps that it
has there's a lot more so get subscribed to see that and big shout out to the sponsor of this video ankor so if you're even considering getting a Vision Pro you probably already have an iPhone in which case it would be good to at least know about anker's new mag go lineup so they've got some charging accessories this one I think is pretty sweet this is three in one so it's called the wireless charging station it unfolds it's lightweight and Compact and you can charge three things at once your iPhone
up on the mag safe charger then something like airpods down here at the cheat charger at the bottom and flip out an Apple Watch charger and a 30-minute charge can give your Apple Watch series 9 almost 50% battery but this one is actually super convenient to me this is the mag go power bank so again mag safe slap start on the back of the phone but it's got the screen on it so you can always charge on the go and there's a built-in battery and we love good "built-in battery but it's 10,000 Mah"
hours so you can charge your iPhone 15 Pro almost to full times without even plugging into the wall and there's also a nice little stand so you can have it in a what's that feature called standby mode whenever you want just by popping it up like that so I like that too so both of these things can charge your devices up to 15 wats wirelessly and they're good with ch2 as well so they can charge your non iones if you want that so I think it's worth it check it out Link in the description and shout
out to ankor again for sponsoring this portion of the video so that's been it thanks again for watching and I'm going to go set up my Vision Pro now catch you  w
