all right now that we're back down to earth after all that Vision Pro launch stuff I've had a chance to go back and repick up some of the things that I was testing that got like interrupted by that week of chaos and there's some really good stuff the Oppo Find X7 Ultra design I really like more than I expected the Zenbook Duo the full screen dual screen laptop for 2024 is kind of sick and there's some other stuff that is better than expected but the one that stood out to me maybe the most of the
small is this guy right here the OnePlus 12 this may have flown a little bit under the radar I mean with everything that's been going on but it's gotten some improvements from last year and it is priced very competitively matter of fact let's just start with that $7.99 and you also get a free upgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM half terabyte model for that price if you pre-order it's literally already marked down to that on Amazon so I'll have a link below Flagship price yes but when it's
competing theoretically against some of "the old phones 1,000 1200" "$1,300 then suddenly it's kind of in the" category of uh dare I say Flagship killer so look it's nearly the same on the outside they found what they like and they're keeping it consistent same shapes same camera bump Circle that kind of melts into the side with these neural details around it it's still Gorilla Glass 5 on the back and there's a new set of colors and textures but in general you'd be forgiven for thinking
it's nearly the same as last year or maybe you wouldn't but don't let that fool you up front this screen is I think the biggest noticeable physical difference from last year it gets way "brighter up to 1,600 nits outdoors and" "it's hitting crazy numbers now 4,500" knits Peak HDR brightness basically it's super impressive and extremely readable outdoors and in any light but it also gets extremely dim too now I don't like that it's this curved over the edges like you can see the light fall off and
the extra Reflections that come with that but basically from corner to corner this 6.8 in 1440p ltpo Pro xdr display is a real upgrade over last year so then the rest of the upgrades to this phone are definitely a case of a bunch of little changes all like stacking up on top of each other to equal a large difference from last year does that make sense like that's that's what smartphones are nowadays I remember reviewing the OnePlus One and then the OnePlus 2 the next year and just the
gigantic total shift big Direction changes between those two phones nowadays it's just about like finding a bunch of clever little things and stacking a bunch of little improvements on top of each other just make the user experience a little better so obviously if you're going to be a Flagship killer you got to have the newest chip inside so it does it's a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 not that you'll notice a whole ton of difference side by side with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone but this phone
does have much better cooling as well so it's giving them some headro to play with slightly boosted clock speeds and it's benchmarking right behind the gaming phones and the s24 ultra in real real world use that just means this phone is super fast really really fluid it's a smooth phone all the time like this is something one plus has done really well for a long time even with high performance mode being off in the battery settings by default but speaking of battery this phone is definitely
prioritizing battery super long battery life over like Ultra high-end performance numbers and getting every last FPS out of the thing and as a result this is a battery champ first of all you just start with a huge capacitor so it's got one of the biggest batteries ever in a OnePlus Flagship it's now a 5400 mAh battery that's bigger than a lot of other phones that are Ultras now and you better believe they've kept their trademarked super fast charging also so it's technically a split battery
it's dual 2700 mampers and it can juice up at 80 Watts wired this combination of huge battery awesome battery life prioritization of battery length and Ultra fast charging honestly makes this at least a contender to think about now for battery champ of the Year matter of fact if you just leave this phone and all of its out the boox settings meaning not in high performance mode just regular performance mode by default 1080p which it is out the box and then just Auto frame rate you can get two
full light days out of this phone and then when you finally do get down to near zero you can charge up to half battery in like 12 minutes if you want to go all the way full that's only going to take about half an hour it's just so easy and on top of all of that there is up to 50 W wireless charging so if you've got a compatible airv charger you obviously have to buy that separately but the OnePlus 11 didn't even have wireless charging at all so this is a gigantic Improvement I almost want to
get greedy and also wish that there was ch2 support for wireless charging but I don't know about you but ch2 has felt like it's off to a weird Rocky start especially this year it's been surprisingly uncommon for any phones to support ch2 with the magnets and wireless charging this is likely because there seems to be a 15 W charging limit with ch2 for now so if you want to do fast wireless charging you aren't doing ch2 so yeah no ch2 Wireless no magnets but very very fast charging either way
way better display better chip better battery and also now the cameras have gotten an upgrade now I'm just going to say cameras have been a relatively weak point for oneplus's highest end phones for a while now we've always wanted to call them Flagship Killers but people love cameras in Flagship phones and just hasn't quite been able to match that highest level I'd say now it's on the acceptable for a flagship level but it's not quite beating those yet and that's still true about this phone now this
main sensor it is actually very slightly different instead of the OnePlus open Sony lyt t808 sensor it is the lyt 808 sensor it's two more megapixels it's slightly wider aperture with the glass in front of it nevertheless basically these OnePlus 12 photos aren't going to shock you I've done some side-by-side comparisons I've even said this before it's pretty good most of the time it's pretty sharp it's a little contrasti than the OnePlus open the HDR effect looks fine it just it falls apart a
little too quickly as soon as there's adverse conditions especially low light but here's the thing just for the context of that it's not that far behind we've already tested this because we did the blind smartphone camera test last year with 20 of the best smartphone cameras in the world and in that test was the OnePlus open so yeah there's a lot of software involved these cameras but basically this extremely similar camera system in the standard light photo it had the third highest ELO
rating behind the two pixels then in portrait mode it was also top 10 but in low light it was fifth from the bottom right around the Sony and below the razor so in summary yeah the camera system is new it does have new hardware it has a new zoom and everything but all together it is just like a lot of the other stuff I'm showing you a little bit better than last year and that's going to be good enough for a lot of people actually most people most of the time but if we want to consider it Flagship
it's just there is a little bit of a gap till it reaches the best but I'll tell you what they keep they even more keep stacking it up there are so many little things about using this OnePlus phone that I really like like I love that I can specifically Force any app I want to be at whatever frame rate I want like there's literally a list of every single app on my phone and by default you've probably noticed all of the mapping apps like ways and Google Maps they always even on every other 120 HZ phone they
always override and run at 60 HZ but on this phone I can just fix it just give me all the frames please I also love that this phone has an infrared blaster one of the least common features in the world of a modern smartphone alongside like a headphone jack but yeah it literally lets you turn on and off and control appliances remotely without having to find the remote like this TV here or or a stranger TV I don't know it's the little things I love that this USBC Port not only supports basically
the fastest charging we've ever seen on a phone in the US but also supports extremely fast data transfer speeds this is a USB 3.2 gen 1 Port the names and and generations are horrible at this point and Incredibly confusing all you really need to know is that this has basically the best data speeds available from a USBC phone so if you get the right cable you can get large files like videos on and off of the device real quick and then a lot of you will probably love that this new screen
supports High pwm dimming if you've never heard of this before it might not even matter to you but there is a select fraction of the population that is specifically sensitive to the flickering that becomes visible at super low brightness with a lot of these smartphone OLED displays to the point where like it causes headaches and eye fatigue so some smartphones including this one are now addressing it with super high pulse width modulation basically they still flicker on and off
to get that lower perceived brightness but much much faster than the human eye "can perceive 2,160 HZ in this phone's" case so it still appears liquid smooth at all brightness levels which is awesome if you use your phone in the rain or when it's wet you probably already know how chaotic that feels like there's memes about it like it it just seems to kind of act on its own when there's water droplets on the screen but this phone claims that with a new technology called aqua touch it will
totally remain as usable as ever even with water all over the screen now you might have seen the ads for it it might sound ridiculous but it actually works it's not not perfect obviously but you can definitely feel that it's dramatically more responsive to the point where I can actually type things on this wet phone screen where I just would not want to do that on any other phone without this kind of feels like magic I am very impressed and then there's even just extra little tiny
things on top of that like 12 or 16 gigs of fast Ram that's sick feature prooof um also Dolby Atmos with spatial audio support great it also has great haptics like all this tiny stuff adds up to be a great overall experience but it's not perfect right let's be real no phone is perfect but at least I can say about this phone that also the downsides are also a couple small things like I for one I've already talked about this but I'm kind of over the curve displays so this one keeping that it's not a deal
breaker like you might even argue it's a little more character to this phone in the world of 2024 smartphones but it definitely has its downsides from the glare to the light falloff to the drop test durability but okay fine they've gone curved but then the fingerprint sensor underneath is also still a pretty average Optical sensor doesn't feel like it's been upgraded in years and then for having the new Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip inside which a lot of other flagships do this phone doesn't really have any of
the AI features like at all and this is something I wanted to keep an eye on with all these phones coming out with this chip early in this year which is okay Qualcomm puts out a new chip small performance gains small efficiency gains but also huge new AI capabilities and this phone kind of just skipped the AI part now not that that's a disaster but those were some genuinely useful features the only one I found on this phone is in the photo editor and it's called AI palets but it's just like
a color overlay I don't even really think there's that much AI going on with this at all so none of that generative fill crop correction none of that magic editor stuff none of that auto live transcription of phone calls or live translation of phone calls none of that like speaker labels in The Voice app none of the auto summaries in the browser anything like that it's just none of it it's not on this phone and then also random bug I don't know every time I'm in the overlay browser and I
reach up to my favorite little alert slider on the OnePlus phone and change modes it opens a search box like to find in page I don't know why they shouldn't be connected but it does it every single time but maybe the biggest legitimate downside of this phone when you're comparing it to to the other flagships it's going up against is it's promised fewer years of software update support now I've already gotten a pretty major software update since I started testing this phone big camera improvements and
Bug fixes and stuff like that great but they are only promising only promising four years of software updates and 5 years of security updates now that's fine a lot of people only plan on keeping this phone for 3 or 4 years maybe 5 years before I'm moving on to the next one but in the world of the flagships the pixels the Samsungs of the world even the iPhones giving you six or seven years of software updates this is just notably behind on that maybe OnePlus didn't think it was worth the
extra resources it doesn't think people care that much about it to actually spend money on it to put the resources in but yeah four or five versus seven so is this a Flagship killer well that just depends on your definition of a flagship doesn't it I think this is probably the most compelling thing about this phone is going to be how competitively priced it is because it's very similar in a lot of ways to let's call it s24 Ultra right but I've seen this phone the 16 gigs of
RAM half terabyte version for $8.99 on their site but if you pre-order it you can get that for $7.99 but they're also advertising it in a lot of places for $6.99 because they're apparently just giving you a 100 bucks for a tradein of any phone in any condition so if you're going with "$699 and this phone starts at 1,300" bucks then yeah that is a damn good deal so yeah i' just be looking at what's important to you like if I would say if camera is really important to you or if
long-term software support is actually super high on your list or if any of those AI features looked really compelling or really interesting that you'd want them then you'd probably end up going with one of those other flagships but for everything else like for performance for a great screen for incredible battery super fast charging Ultra smooth like this phone is is better than you probably think oh and on top of all that OnePlus also around the same time has released this phone right
here it looks almost the same but this is the OnePlus 12r and this is just a a budget budgeted a budget version even more so than this phone already just basically cutting a few Corners a few corners on the camera right it's a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 instead of the Gen 3 there's no wireless charging things like that it's uh IP 64 instead of ip65 whatever it's a slightly trimmed down version again 500 bucks I'm just saying so if these phones weren't already on your radar they
probably should be thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
