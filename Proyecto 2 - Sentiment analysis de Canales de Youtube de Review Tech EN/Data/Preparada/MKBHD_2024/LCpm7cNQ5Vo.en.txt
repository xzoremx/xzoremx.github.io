we've made it to the end of 2024 this has been the longest year of my life between making these videos and competing in Ultimate Frisbee all over the world this year controversies and also a huge background project that y'all don't know about yet but we'll soon but just a mini recap January started off the year with a bang Apple Vision Pro came out and I had a lot of thoughts this is also when I got invited to try out for Team USA for Ultimate Frisbee more on that later
picture of the month for me is this this is the last photo I took of my Tesla Model S daily driver being driven Away by the new owner in February Sora got unveiled I dribbled the 3D printed basketball for the first time I uploaded the longest video of the Year reviewing every single Samsung Galaxy phone ever 43 minutes and 46 seconds long that would be 20.7 gigs I also reviewed the Fisker Ocean on the autofocus Channel as the worst car I've ever tested which then proceeded to blow up I was far from
the first person to say negative things about this car but for a number of different reasons this one hit a little different and I mean I was accused of sabotaging the company's stock price on purpose killing the company as a whole none of which are really true I also don't care about the stock prices of these companies but we learned some lessons about negative reviews and bad products and the relationship that they have more on that later too but most excitingly in February I joined Ridge as
the chief creative partner which honestly to me is the biggest thing I've ever done outside of YouTube it's really exciting we've already started making physical products and we have some more in development that you guys are going to start to see coming out in 2025 so I'm I'm excited about that picture of the month for February this headline about Apple Vision Pro I think it's a translation error it's supposed to say that MKBHD weighs in but yeah in March small phones officially
died I reviewed the cybertruck and probably our biggest production as a team ever and I also got to go to Japan for the first time to play in one of the biggest Ultimate Frisbee tournaments in the world in the shadow of Mount Fuji uh I went with New York's team one of two American teams that were there and we won it was sick this is also the month that uh that Team USA try out that I mentioned earlier I found out that I made that team for the first time ever in my career so that added a bunch of uh
training camps and an international World Championship trip to Australia to the calendar then on March 14th Pi Day uh Tesla Service man pulled up to the studio to change a tire on somebody's car here at the studio and that's something that they do sometimes if you're in the right area of the country they'll bring the service to you with a little truck and so they performed the service it was very convenient until it caught on fire it started off as a a small not so concerning fire contained
inside the van and then quickly turned into a pretty big full-on vehicle fire right outside our studio this was the dash cam footage from my car which detected an event while it was parked and automatically started recording so yeah the local fire department was able to put it out pretty quickly apparently the air compressor that they used to fill the tire and just shorted while sitting out there in the truck by itself thankfully the truck was by itself and no one was hurt photo of the month
though obviously was going to be Fuji in April I reviewed the Humane pin and the rabbit R1 two Standalone AI products that just clearly came up way short of their promises and still do to an extent but this reignited the conversation about negative product reviews no pun intended about ignited but it felt like everyone on the internet had something to say about it this time people weighing in on the side of consumers also on the side of product makers I still stand by everything I said in
those reviews but what I mostly Learned was the power that these reviews actually have which is fascinating and to borrow from a conversation that I had earlier with Colin and Samir that the weight of the publish button is heavy oh also this was the month that we went to shoot a video in Ohio in the direct path of the total solar eclipse total coincidence but also the best Coincidence of my life I've told you guys before but my bucket list is basically to experience as many natural
phenomenon as possible blizzard see a tornado Aurora Borealis all these fun things and uh fun fact during this month I also had all four of my wisdom teeth taken out during the earthquake that happened in New Jersey true story not making that up photo of the month shot on my iPhone 15 Pro SpaceX launches sometimes do crazy things to the sky in May I gave the commencement speech to the graduates of the college I graduated from less than 10 years ago it was surreal I made a chaty BT joke it went
pretty good but mostly I was reminded that time flies and we also have the First Team USA training camp at a tournament in columia metagene is is beautiful the city is like kind of carved into the side of the mountain it's amazing we also won that tournament it was sick and photo of the month nice one in June the autofocus Channel hit a million subscribers I attempted to interview Tim Cook but ended up just reminding him that the Magic Mouse exists and I made one of my gril videos
which was a behind the scenes video of the tech behind a PGA Tour broadcast I've been a golfer since I was 10 so just like being up close with that stuff is the coolest thing ever but also there's so much Tech in all the rest of sports so there will definitely be more of these I also played in the good good desert open with a bunch of other golf creators I didn't even play that great it was super Rusty but it's literally the first time I've ever played golf in front of a serious crowd of people and
it was awesome photo of the month my crude mockup that became the thumbnail of the Golf Tech video so then in July I told the FBI story that I thought I'd never tell we may or may not have another one TBD and then we had our second Team USA training camp this time in Denver with that nice thin air photo of the month for me me my wristband tan starting to get a little bit crazy then in August okay all the new pixels came out and the books Palma really got us rethinking handheld devices as a
category and then I took the longest break that I have ever taken from making YouTube videos ever but I was in Australia for 2 weeks for the world ultimate championships there's three divisions open mixed and women's I played for the Mixed team we played against Switzerland Australia AR artina Japan Germany Great Britain Italy Australia and Canada on our way to a gold medal as part of a USA sweep uh  won break for the USA NOA Baka to Marquez brownley for the score the game
and the championship the United States world champions in the mixed division I I think I need to make an ultimate frisbee explained video because I I can see people getting confused every time I post about it and there's so many different versions of it that it is actually kind of confusing but it's something that I care a lot about maybe that's a 2025 thing but then hey picture of that month very Australia and just like that it was tember I flew directly from Australia to the Apple event for
the iPhone 16 reveal fun fact okay thanks to time zones I took off from Australia at 6: A.M the morning of the Apple event and then 10 hours later I landed in California at 6: a.m. the morning of the event and so that's why I had something like I think it ended up being 31 total stand hours for the day I was maybe a little bit delirious but I still think that video turned out fine you could probably tell I was tired though we also launched the low toop version of the model 251s with Adams
which are on sale now and they are the best version yet of the most comfortable shoe you'll ever wear I love these things I wear them almost every day I'm so glad we got to make them and then Time Magazine put me as one of the hundred most influential people in AI really interesting list probably because of the rabbit and Humane stuff but yeah crazy list and then we launched panels our wallpaper app to the world this was something we' worked on as a team in the background for the better
part of a year you know sourcing from artists developing designing everything and then launching it with the review of the new iPhone unfortunately that was a total misjudgment on my part I spent way too much time well way more time on the product review than actually explaining the app itself which do it needed its own explanation so people didn't really understand I didn't really properly explain the features or what it did why it existed or why it even had a premium pric tier and it had a bunch of other
issues at launch to begin with that it never should have had but nevertheless it was my turn to get roasted this is the same guy that reviewed the Fisker earlier this year and the Humane pin and the rabbit so now it was all turned on me as the person making the product that wasn't up to par and I deserved it so I prioritized fixing things based on feedback and obviously making the video actually explaining everything about it um but yeah that was the first time really feeling like the entire internet
was pointed at me but for a negative like people outside of the Tech Community everyone being disappointed and it sucks to disappoint people so that was some serious lessons learned in communication in the priorities that we have and uh and hopefully being able to improve things I'm proud of how much we were able to improve based on the feedback that we actually got so now the app and the artists involved are thriving and doing better than ever and I look forward to continuing to share
cool wallpapers for the people who care about that stuff photo of the month this uh this kangaro was surprisingly like concerningly chill about this picture then in October we saw Robo taxis and robots that may come out someday maybe we saw AR glasses that are out and some that are also definitely never coming out I also saw my face in a Best Buy shout out to Ridge and my photo of the month goes to Pony the other Ultimate Frisbee team I play on going to Nationals having our best Tournament of
the Year eventually losing in the finals and taking silver then in November I reviewed maybe the product of the year the Bas M4 Mac Mini just became easily the best deal in Apple's whole lineup maybe in all of computers then directly after I released a DJI action cam video a video about using these action cams it was sponsored there were a whole bunch of learnings about sponsored videos from that experience that I took in pretty quickly but I wanted to use this opportunity to address the bigger issue
from that whole experience which was the driving clip even though it's no longer in that video so there was a clip in that video since removed of POV driving a Lamborghini and accelerating to over 90 mph in a 35 mph Zone it's just stupid and dangerous not just for the actual act which is stupid and dangerous but also for the potential precedent that it could set because like we said I know people watch these videos and for someone to watch that and think that it's okay so I apologized uh I removed
it which I still think is the correct thing to do obviously never doing it in the first place would have been way smarter but um I also never gave any any context or any other details or anything around it just because I didn't think it felt like just excuses that nobody needed but I feel like for those of you who are watching my videos you deserve at least a little bit of of of context and explanation of how we got there in the first place so earlier in November uh another YouTuber who will remain
nameless invited me out to test drive a car and I said okay yeah sounds fun we went out and the way these work is that the salesperson sort of takes you out on a pre-designated test drive route it was it was outside New Jersey I didn't know the space very well so I just followed their lead they sort of showed you where to go and I we went out and then came back so I had the action cam with me as I had for the past couple weeks as i' shot Clips here and there around just on
how it could be used to shoot anything anywhere so on the way back as oh okay I'll shoot a clip of of a few seconds of driving because this could be used to shoot driving shots um none of this context really matters that much and there's a reason for speed limits and I own that responsibility I'm lucky that nothing went wrong during that test drive I just I would have been my fault and that would have been horrible so uh I encourage you to not do what I did I learned several valuable lessons here in
all of this um you know making mistakes and genuinely learning from them and changing I think that's a super important thing to just have as a as a human and then also as the responsibility that I have as a very visible Creator and that people look up to what I do and what we make as a team so clearly everything deserves an extra layer of diligence and again that the publish button is very heavy so picture of the month for November my high school also has an ultimate frisbee team and
every year they have an alumni versus current high school team game an annual game I've played in that game a lot both as a player and as an alumni never lost never lost so then in December I reviewed Sora as it was Unleashed on the public and then it very quickly got one uped by Google's vo and now the AI video generation Wars are suddenly underway not sure how to feel about that yet and then of course I gave out my 2024 smartphone Awards and about half the trophies have actually already
been claimed by the companies that won them oh and and Bitcoin hit 100K so yeah I guess I'll keep holding photo of the month foggy cold New York City night it's definitely a vibe from the sidewalk below so 2024 was a crazy year uh and I learned I learned a lot of lessons and I think what's maybe the most interesting is the one main lesson kind of came from both Ultimate Frisbee and this stuff here on YouTube which is and I had a coach say this and I never forget it that pressure is a
privilege in in sport you don't necessarily get to always play for something that means a lot it might mean a lot to you but something that really means a lot uh to actually have that opportunity is crazy it's awesome and the same thing here pressure is a privilege like you don't necessarily get to make something and and create something new and send it out to the internet and have anybody care about it so the fact that we get to do that here is a privilege and uh I don't want
to forget that and I also think it's sort of clarified it's it's made a lot clearer what I want to do in 2025 and going forward which is a bit of a return to the basics a little back to the basics of quality over quantity a little bit more good videos rather than just a ton of videos so hopefully you're down for that as always thank you for watching you guys are what makes this possible catch you next year peace
