so in a world of electric cars in this video we're going to be taking a look at "a $20,000 hybrid $120,000 hybrid and a" $2 million hybrid car so this video is part an explainer part a chance to drive some really sick cars shout out to Triple F collection we'll get there anyway unless you guys been living under a rock you've seen that electric cars have been having a bit of a Renaissance lately surging in popularity till the number one best sold new car on earth is electric but
they are still very much a new technology like they're obviously awesome with instant torque and no emissions and fast acceleration but they have these huge heavy batteries and they take forever to recharge and there's not enough infrastructure for everyone to own them so there's this window now where it makes a lot of sense that maybe for most people a hybrid is actually the best   so I don't think anyone's buying the Corolla for Speed or power I mean if I'm being honest it's actually still pretty
Zippy so this car starts at "$24,000 and it's a hybrid purely purely" for efficiency so the basics of this hybrid system and many others in the same class is that the wheels can be driven by the gas engine or the electric motor or both so this Corolla hybrid has a 1.8 L engine and one electric motor at the front axle that deliver a combined 138 horsepower and it's powering the electric motor with a pretty small 1.6 KW battery so at low speeds you've probably been in a car like this the car
goes totally electric the gas engine turns off but once you go over a certain speed or use a certain amount of power then it's going to fire up the gas engine again and it couples it with the electric motor then anytime you're breaking or coasting that's when it charges the battery back up it's as you're slowing down it captures some of that energy so it never actually needs to be plugged in to charge up that small battery and this system is good for literally 50 m per gallon when you drive
this car you literally have a game score an Eco score as you drive of if you can slow down and roll onto your accelerations better and roll to a stop more easily you can gamify efficiency in this car to get your maximum miles per gallon so it actually divides it up I have my Ecco zone so I'm driving and if I get my little bar in the ecozone I'm doing a good job and then I have starts cruises and stops I've gotten my eco score pretty high not to brag but I've seen it in the 70s which is pretty sick I don't
know what happens when I get to 100 but what I do know is the better I get that score the more miles per gallon I get but yeah pretty much everything about the rest of this car is designed around that efficiency it's aerodynamic enough that it slips through the air it's got tires that have a low rolling resistance it doesn't have these like sticky grippy tires that's that's actually against efficiency in this case so if you're looking for a reason why someone would buy a hybrid today it's because they're
not trying to charge a huge battery every night in their garage or rely on the grid or rely on finding public Chargers it's cuz they just want better gas mileage and they want to spend less not zero but less on gas today but you already know these cars are obviously very utility focused they're for people who just are going places right but what if you're more after the ultimate driving machine something a little more versatile then you can spend a little more money and  this all right so this car starts at
"about $100,000 a little over and this" car is a hybrid for versatility so the idea is this is a BMW 750e there's a bunch of vehicles in this class but yeah you've spent enough money now at this point that you can reap the benefits of both Gas and Electric so this hybrid system has a bit more Hardware to accomplish two different goals so there's a 3 l straight 6 engine making around 300 horsepower and and a mediumsized 14.4 KW larger battery powering a roughly 200 horsepower
electric motor so you're totaling around 500 horsepower so once again it can drive using both Gas and Electric just like the Toyota but now there's enough battery capacity that you can also Drive fully electric at totally normal everyday driving speeds up to like 30 mil on a charge without ever turning on the gas engine and then also unlike the Corolla this is a plug-in hybrid so you can directly plug the car into a wall to replenish the battery and just keep driving around on electric as long as
you want to with zero gas use so it does everything the Toyota does but more I do feel like plug-in hybrids at this moment in time are the one that make the most sense for the most people that I see driving them cuz if you have a short commute let's say you have a 10m commute every day and you just plug in at a charger at work or in your garage every night or during work in the daytime you can just straight up never pay for gas again and drive it just like an electric car but on the off chance you
do need to drive further go for a road trip or just do something more than your normal 10m commute you have all the benefits of a gas car thankfully these hybrids also have one crucial piece of the electric car which is regenerative braking which means it's going to be able to recuperate a lot of the energy once I've gotten up to speed and start filling up the battery as I'm driving so there's a little little graph on the dash you can see here which means as I accelerate and I take energy out of the
battery it goes up but as I decelerate it's actually blending and friction braking with regenerative braking and if I drive around like this long enough especially if I go down Hills and break a lot I will actually start adding to the charge of this battery too but you know how electric cars also have that party trick of instant torque available at any RPM and any speed well the hybrid should benefit a little bit from that too so because this motor motor is powerful enough and the battery is big
enough to provide the voltage yes in the sportiest mode this car also when you floor it gets that initial hit from the electricity and then follows with the surge of the rest of the power from the gas engine oh and one of the things I say a lot on the autofocus Channel or I've said before is there are certain types of cars that are best to go electric and because of how much batteries weigh cars that are already heavy are the best ones to go electric so like this is a big four-door luxury
sedan there is no attempt at making this a small car it's huge it's got lots of space it's soft it's cushy this is a great type of car to go electric which is why the i7 is good but yeah there are lots of other versions of this the Rav 4 hybrid the Toyota Prius Prime hybrid all sorts of other plug-in hybrids yeah if I would have recommend one version for more people like this you still get all the nice plushy suspension and all the tech in the car and all the screens and
the way it drives it's the same thing but more accessible you don't have to have a plug in your garage so all that is fun that's I get it it's versatile this is why they call it the ultimate driving machine but you can always spend more you can always spend more and when you do you end up in the territory of Specialists and this is definitely a  one second just want it  that I've just got eyes for you no other could enchant me darling like you  you so this car costs $25 million and it's a hybrid purely for
performance which I mean you could probably tell just by looking at it but also by the fact that I'm sitting in the middle of the car right now I have to get used to this this this is the McLaren speed tail okay so my clar's done this a few times one Center driver seat two passenger seats and just a whole lot of calibration for me for this insane driving position but yeah this thing is a hybrid it's technically a hybrid so this hybrid system is pretty crazy it's very focused on literally
just going as fast as physically possible which is just about maximizing power and minimizing weight so there's already a twin turbo 4 L V8 engine pushing out 750 plus horsepower but then they've also designed a special small but super high-powered 1.6 KW battery that powers a single electric motor by itself that generates an extra 300 more horsepower so the total is now over "1,000 horsepower and that motor is" basically just being used to help spin the wheels even faster than the engine
by itself could there is no electricon mode there is no situation where the gas engine shuts off there are no efficiency goals here this is actually really similar to the turbocharged hybrid setups you literally see in Formula 1 today it's just about going fast so here's a couple of those hilariously over-engineered pieces of this car uh first of all this is the only car I've ever actually driven that's shipped with cameras instead of side view mirrors for even better aerodynamics of course
they've also got the electrochromic glass roof tint and windshield tint instead of moving fabric pieces but then also the active arrow on the back of this car is not just like regular pivoting parts or spoilers or anything like that but it's literally bending the carbon fiber body workor and all of the Paint and Coatings with it up and down when you're under breaking to assist with slowing down it's that's insane if you can see what's happening here and this is also the only car I've ever seen
with a wireless charger that's right the McLaren speed tail Wireless charges so the battery is at the bottom of the car and it's small enough that if the driver doesn't Park exactly over the right spot in their garage it's not a huge deal cuz again it's a small battery it shouldn't take too long and inductive charging has never been particularly efficient but it'll eventually work and no I don't think that this would fly for any fully electric car today everything about the
outside of this car is designed it's sculpted to just cut through the air and that's how it does 0 to 186 mph faster than a Bugatti sheir run and 250 mph in a straight line now I'm going to let you in on a little secret about these super super fast electric cars they need a huge battery to realistically make that happen right let's take Tesla Model S "pla for example 1,000 horsepower crazy" high power output from the battery but in order to do that they need to give it this huge 100 KW battery so that when
you export all that power you don't just drain the battery super quickly you can keep driving like a normal person so that's why you have these super high horsepower electric cars but they always come with the sacrifice of weight they're always heavy the Lucid air it's fighting in it weight the ev6 GT it's fighting how heavy it is with a superar like this it's not fully electric all the time and so they're willing to put in a tiny battery that exports a ton of power and basically drains it in seconds
so I'm going to show you something with this real quick right now I have 100% of my battery I'm going to do just a quick little pull and see just what a couple of seconds of electric assisted  the way down to 74% battery just from that little acceleration 100 to 74 and now it's already it's it's going right back up to 100 it's almost 100 again because I'm driving and recuperating that energy and now it's 100 this is super high-tech stuff and it actually has a lot of parallels to what we see in Formula 1
believe it or not those Formula 1 cars that we're watching on TV today those are small turbocharged hybrid  again that's what the F1 cars are doing out there they are recovering energy as they break and they are spending energy when they accelerate and I guess I guess that's the difference between this and the rimac NAA you remember I you probably have seen the video I did with the quickest electric car in the world the rimac NAA which yes does have a big "heavy battery it weighs like 5,000 lb"
like a model S the crazy thing about that car and that's an anomaly is that has four electric motors which you can kind of think of as being treated like gears but not really this will have a higher top speed simply because it just keeps gearing up sspeed gearbox and it pulls all the way through up to 2 250 mph if you want a hybrid superar you can kind of have both fast and quick in the same car this is fast and quick I mean it's not razor sharp fully electric quick but it's close and it's yeah it's
the fastest it's one of the fastest cars you can possibly build yeah so I guess my point here with the whole video is yes I still fully believe electrification is the future at every level of cars but in the mean time it's pretty clear that hybrids make a lot of sense and they've been right under our noses the whole time that's about
