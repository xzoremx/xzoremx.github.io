this is a Harry Potter Edition collab phone also known as the Oppo Reno 12f and again right from the unboxing experience it's pretty dramatically customized so this thing starts with this huge box including a wax sealed envelope containing an invitation to Hogwarts but it is for Mr Potter though so not for me but then there's a whole bunch of other accessories and other things included with this phone which is custom branded in this shimmery bronze color with a silhouette of Hogwarts on
the glossy stripe down the middle there's also a Harry Potter branded fast charging brick and cable there's an enormous Deathly Hallows themed SIM card ejector tool there's a golden snitch in the Box complete with flapping wings and then it comes with a whole wand which actually also has a stylus tip so you can do some very specific screen off gestures and it will open apps like the camera or the flashlight or the calculator which is kind of hilarious plus of course there's built-in
wallpapers for each of the houses so only thing missing I guess is maybe sorting you into one of the houses
