okay objectively this is a bad smartphone but something is going on here that's kind of nice away this thing is called the books Palma b x kind of a weird name it's supposed to read like books but it some people say books but the idea is it's an eaper device that's supposed to blend the world of the smartphone and the Kindle now I don't want call it a cult or anything like that but this thing has definitely formed its own little fan base over the past couple of months where hey you either know about it or
you don't you're either in or you're not in so the modern smartphone is kind of ridiculous if you haven't thought about it lately just just take a second it's kind of a Marvel of engineering it's amazing that we fit all of this computing power and an amazing screen and a super fast internet connection and a bunch of high quality cameras and sensors in this tiny little glass box that fits in our pockets and lasts all day so there is a lot of upside that comes with that but there is a certain
downside too which is sometimes it can be a little bit much like it can be just a little bit distracting or a little bit addicting or sometimes you want to be able to spend just a little bit more time in the moment instead of looking at the world through your smartphone or just scrolling all the time and so the self-control argument always comes up but there's also been this new wave of devices specifically created to not be as distracting some people are calling them dumb phones sometimes they're even
more limited communication but the thing they all have in common is they literally can't get caught in a doom scrolling Loop because they don't have apps or any distractions on them at all they're purely for function and this one of them has a bit of a cult following now the books Palma I I picked it up because I saw our audio man Ellis started getting really into it seen it in a studio video then there's these articles about it and these reviews of it and people pouring their life into it
and daily driving it but the thing is this is worse than a normal smartphone like I don't want to just skip over that like this it's the shape and size and look of a normal smartphone it's got an octacore CPU it's got 6 gigs of RAM it's got a 6.1 in screen but it's worse there is no SIM card tray so there is no Cellular Connection at all there is no selfie camera the rear camera is only a low reses literal document scanner with no video recording the speakers are almost useless and it maxes out at 128
gigs of storage so yeah it's it's clearly worse but if the mission is to spend less time on your actual smartphone then all of these downsides are actually good things you either get it or you don't you know the thing about e-readers is they are typically pretty limited single-use devices that only let you read with a single app or a single ecosystem of services like the newest Kindle for example it's 100 bucks it's thin and light everybody knows what a Kindle is but really all it's meant to
do is read books from Amazon's Kindle bookstore everything else is an afterthought then there's stuff like the Cobo Libra 2 which is a super popular alternative costs 200 bucks it has some extra journaling features and Pen input but this thing cannot play a single song from Spotify like the theme in this devic is are solid but of course nothing is real as versatile or capable as a full-on smartphone so enter the books Palma the books Palma this thing runs Android and is basically just a straight
up smartphone inside without those data modems so even though it's this awesome epaper display and looks like a moving newspaper with A+ readability and all the benefits that come with the normal e-reader being easy on the eyes you can technically also put whatever you want on it it has the Google Play Store you can sideload AP K so yes you can install the Kindle app and read Kindle books if you want but also you can install the pocket app or rain drop.io or readwise reader and read articles you've saved
you can also install Audible and listen to ebooks with Bluetooth headphones you can also install Spotify and use it as a portable zero distractions music player or podcast player the list goes on so if smartphones are op they're up here and single-purpose e-readers are limited they're more down here then the book's Palama is like right in here which is it's clearly better than a single-purpose e-reader it's more capable but it's clearly not as capable as a full-on smartphone but just enough
to be kind of charming in a sort of can't get sucked into a Tik Tock rabbit hole type of way if you know you know yeah now a couple neat special things that you should know that you've seen before if you're in the eader world battery life is well compared to a smart phone it's actually incredible so this shouldn't be a surprise but if you didn't know eink basically only uses battery when it's actually refreshing and moving the ink around so when it's just sitting on one page or just showing
something for an extended time that actually doesn't use power so battery life on the books here is in the realm of days not hours sometimes weeks for a light user the only other thing that can eat into battery really is the back light or in this case actually the front light so iing screens aren't lit from behind but there are lights around the front so you can still light it up and read in Darker conditions and that light can be tinted to match the color temperature of whatever room you're in
and there are some apps that also will let you map the side buttons to flipping pages instead of just being volume buttons like they normally are and then there are different settings for the refresh modes as well so all the way to the left is HD mode which has the highest quality image with the least ghosting but that's going to be also the slowest refresh rate so that's fine for just sitting and reading but on the far right mode is ultra fast mode which will have the smoothest relative refresh rate
but also the worst quality this is when you scroll and you kind of see a little bit of that ghosting in the background of the previous image honestly it gets quick enough to be able to legibly watch videos if you really really wanted to it's kind of this trippy Harry Potter daily profit kind of world where remember the moving newspapers from the movies like obviously there's no colors and on this model there's not nearly enough resolution to fully appreciate the video but still kind of neat it's
better than nothing but most of the time I leave it inbalanced which is the default and I'm happy to basically never actually watch videos on this thing now a couple times throughout this video I've said you've heard me say things like hey if you know you know or you either get it or you don't and so you may be wondering if I've been converted if I'm joining this books Pama mini cult if I'm going to daily this thing no absolutely not matter of fact if you want to watch the experience of someone
who actually did try to daily this thing I'll link the studio video below where Ellis like really he went to the full lengths to try and you know carried a Wi-Fi hotspot to always have it connected everywhere since there's no SIM card and I mean I don't want to spoil the video but like it's a lot of work and it's not really worth it but that's almost like it's like overlapping like it's missing the point this is I think meant to be or at least it's in its best State when it is a device that
you avoid smartphone tasks on like this as a secondary device that can be my alarm clock in the morning that I just reach over and hit dismiss and I'm not immediately drowned in notifications because there literally is no notification system and I'm not tempted to jump into Tik toks and reals because it really doesn't do that well like maybe there's something to that like maybe there's something to a a dedicated reading device that you can bring anywhere with you on any daily commute
that doesn't ever suck you into the rabbit hole of Twitter or reals or whatever like real people want that like I kind of love this as a literal like an iPod like a portable offline music player that I literally never watch YouTube videos on it's kind of charming in that way and this is somehow all of those things in one so you know I couldn't necessarily tell you the exact moment or why the books Palma became like the face of this movement of these types of devices especially when there
are other Alternatives that keep getting sent to me that are similar stuff like the high sense A9 or the cobro Libra color um then again the high sense A9 is a smartphone it costs a bit more and it has a data connection and some people just don't really want it to do all that and the Cobo Libra color as implied by the name that that's the one with the color display and that's also just a little bit bit extra so kind of feels like the books is in the exact goldilock zone of just enough missing
features that it's captured people's hearts and you know that's how it goes sometimes sometimes you're the at m50s that represent all affordable good sounding headphones maybe you're the GoPro that represents all Smart Action cameras that's the books Pama and that's why it exists this has been MKBHD thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
