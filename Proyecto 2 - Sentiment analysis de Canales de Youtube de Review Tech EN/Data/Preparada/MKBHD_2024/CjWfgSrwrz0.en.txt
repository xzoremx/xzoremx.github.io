okay so one of the best features of the Vision Pro is how good the object tracking and permanence is but it's a bit of a blessing and a curse see this headset is live mapping the 3D space around you and then when you place an object somewhere it stays there like rock solid and it has memory so you can leave windows around your house and then you can leave the room and come back and it'll still be there but if you're in a form of moving Transportation like a train or a plane or the back of a car
then things do get kind of weird because the visual data for the cameras says you're staying still but the gyroscopes and the accelerometers are saying you're moving so the tracking will fail thankfully Apple has actually thought of this and addressed it so there's a feature called travel mode so all you have to do to enable it is pop into the control center and hit that little icon all the way on the left that will deactivate a few of the sensors like the gyroscope and still be able to pin
permanent objects in your space so that they don't leave as you leave now you can watch movies on a plane
