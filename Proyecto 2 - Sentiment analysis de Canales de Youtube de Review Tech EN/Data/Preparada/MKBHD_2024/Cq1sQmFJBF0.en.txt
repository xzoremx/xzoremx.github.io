so the original Volkswagen bus was so iconic everyone wanted to see a new electric version of this thing and now that it's out it gets more attention than a cyber Tru but what you need to see is how much storage in this thing all right so just in the front seat double decker storage over here then you've got a nice little double decker storage here with a lip and then a real glove box down here you've got hidden storage with cup holders over here another thing with hidden storage with
just a drawer right here a spot for your phone if you want to drop it in there with a wireless charger another spot over here for your key and some not so hidden storage in the Middle with dividers that are ice scraper and a bottle opener and if you don't want any of this in the middle you just hit this button and get rid of the whole thing then in the middle there's two in the door there's two on the seat there's some hidden storage up here and then in the back there's a whole bunch of
Cubbies then from the rear the entire third row is removable plus there's some storage down here and a built-in bench
