well this is a pretty serious headline "so Tesla recalls all 4,000 cyber trucks" they've ever made due to a faulty accelerator pedal but the story behind it is also kind of strange so here this is the accelerator pedal of the Tesla cyber truck apparently there's a an unapproved change to the adhesive holding the pedal to the pad that it's on so some extra soap or something like that so if you hit the pedal hard enough it could become unstuck now I guess it's not the end of the world but actually if
you look up here in the footwall of the truck this shelf's angle here is unfortunately the perfect angle that if the pedal does happen to get unstuck and somebody actually showed this it actually pins down the whole accelerator pedal at 100% throttle so this goes from being a pretty annoying build quality issue to a pretty serious safety issue that's going to need to be fixed but PSA if you do actually have a cyber truck the brake pedal does override that accelerator but also definitely take it
to the service center because
