so you might have heard about this this is Wilson's new airless basketball prototype it is 3D printed and the number one question everyone wants to know is how does it actually bounce but before I even bounce it there are other differences this is a regular NBA ball it feels different like it's got this slick texture to it um it also smells very different kind of smells like a shoe also I'm sure other people have heard of uh Trypophobia with the the thing with the holes in it like this has
a lot of that might bother some people but anyway okay real question how does it bounce NBA ball airless  quiet that's like 90% of a regular ball that's crazy I always wondered if things would get inside it like if you played on a dirty Court outside but ah this is crazy I I did not expect that anyway "this thing is $2,500 so don't expect to" see it everywhere anytime soon but it is an interesting idea
