00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
here we've got probably what looks like
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.630 align:start position:0%
here we've got probably what looks like
another<00:02:23.400><c> two</c><00:02:23.680><c> here</c><00:02:23.879><c> they'</c><00:02:24.000><c> got</c><00:02:24.120><c> some</c><00:02:24.239><c> foam</c><00:02:24.480><c> on</c>

another two here they' got some foam on
 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.430 align:start position:0%
another two here they' got some foam on
them<00:02:24.800><c> they're</c><00:02:24.959><c> kind</c><00:02:25.080><c> of</c><00:02:25.239><c> strange</c>

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
them they're kind of strange
 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.670 align:start position:0%
them they're kind of strange
honestly<00:02:27.440><c> uh</c><00:02:27.599><c> this</c><00:02:27.720><c> is</c><00:02:27.879><c> all</c><00:02:28.160><c> hard</c><00:02:28.560><c> plastic</c><00:02:29.560><c> and</c>

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
honestly uh this is all hard plastic and
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.790 align:start position:0%
honestly uh this is all hard plastic and
then<00:02:30.000><c> and</c><00:02:30.280><c> I</c><00:02:30.360><c> think</c><00:02:30.519><c> that's</c><00:02:30.720><c> about</c><00:02:30.959><c> it</c><00:02:31.160><c> so</c><00:02:31.800><c> 360°</c>

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
then and I think that's about it so 360°
 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.390 align:start position:0%
then and I think that's about it so 360°
sound<00:02:33.080><c> is</c><00:02:33.360><c> like</c><00:02:33.599><c> I</c><00:02:33.680><c> don't</c><00:02:33.800><c> know</c><00:02:33.959><c> just</c><00:02:34.040><c> a</c><00:02:34.160><c> couple</c>
