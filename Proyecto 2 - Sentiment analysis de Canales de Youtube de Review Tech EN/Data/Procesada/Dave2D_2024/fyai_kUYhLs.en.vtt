why the air jet used a technology that

why the air jet used a technology that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
was like basically vibrating material so
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.789 align:start position:0%
was like basically vibrating material so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
they would take these pzo electric
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.510 align:start position:0%
they would take these pzo electric
membranes<00:01:26.280><c> and</c><00:01:26.400><c> they</c><00:01:26.520><c> would</c><00:01:26.680><c> flap</c><00:01:27.079><c> them</c><00:01:27.320><c> very</c>

membranes and they would flap them very
 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.270 align:start position:0%
membranes and they would flap them very

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
you vibrate them like that you're able

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
these act as two electrodes so when you

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
kind of housing like in this example
 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.909 align:start position:0%
kind of housing like in this example
here<00:06:53.120><c> uh</c><00:06:53.240><c> this</c><00:06:53.360><c> is</c><00:06:53.639><c> actually</c><00:06:54.120><c> housing</c><00:06:54.800><c> the</c>

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
here uh this is actually housing the
 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.390 align:start position:0%
here uh this is actually housing the

middle sized one that you saw previously
 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.070 align:start position:0%
middle sized one that you saw previously
and<00:06:57.599><c> this</c><00:06:57.800><c> was</c><00:06:58.000><c> the</c><00:06:58.160><c> thing</c><00:06:58.360><c> that</c><00:06:58.479><c> was</c><00:06:58.639><c> inside</c>

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
and this was the thing that was inside
 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.950 align:start position:0%
and this was the thing that was inside
the<00:06:59.599><c> machine</c><00:06:59.919><c> that</c><00:07:00.039><c> I</c><00:07:00.120><c> showed</c><00:07:00.319><c> you</c><00:07:00.479><c> earlier</c>

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.710 align:start position:0%

to<00:10:11.480><c> static</c><00:10:12.240><c> pressure</c><00:10:12.920><c> so</c><00:10:13.519><c> static</c><00:10:13.959><c> pressure</c><00:10:14.920><c> is</c>

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
to static pressure so static pressure is
 

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.310 align:start position:0%
to static pressure so static pressure is
I<00:10:15.880><c> guess</c><00:10:16.040><c> it's</c><00:10:16.360><c> the</c><00:10:17.000><c> it's</c><00:10:17.200><c> the</c><00:10:17.440><c> ability</c><00:10:17.880><c> for</c><00:10:18.120><c> a</c>

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
I guess it's the it's the ability for a
 

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
I guess it's the it's the ability for a

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
fan these things have like I'd say like
 

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.389 align:start position:0%
fan these things have like I'd say like
40<00:10:27.600><c> to</c><00:10:27.800><c> maybe</c><00:10:28.399><c> 50</c><00:10:29.399><c> pascals</c><00:10:29.920><c> of</c><00:10:30.079><c> static</c>

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.670 align:start position:0%

better<00:10:33.000><c> because</c><00:10:33.240><c> that</c><00:10:33.360><c> means</c><00:10:33.680><c> that</c><00:10:33.839><c> you</c><00:10:34.000><c> can</c>

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
