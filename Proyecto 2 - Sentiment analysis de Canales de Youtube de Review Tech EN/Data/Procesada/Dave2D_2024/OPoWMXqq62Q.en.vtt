00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
is like it's a cool idea but I'm worried

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's a gimmick and my simple reasoning

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that if that feature was actually

is that if that feature was actually
