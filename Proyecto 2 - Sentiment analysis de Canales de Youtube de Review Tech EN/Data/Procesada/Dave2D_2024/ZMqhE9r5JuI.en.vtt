they lock you out so my question was in
 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.190 align:start position:0%
they lock you out so my question was in

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
my brain why why don't they just give me
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.949 align:start position:0%
my brain why why don't they just give me
access<00:03:09.560><c> to</c><00:03:10.159><c> tapping</c><00:03:11.159><c> and</c><00:03:11.280><c> I</c><00:03:11.400><c> think</c><00:03:11.560><c> the</c><00:03:11.680><c> main</c>

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 align:start position:0%
access to tapping and I think the main
 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.869 align:start position:0%
access to tapping and I think the main
reason<00:03:12.319><c> why</c><00:03:12.480><c> they</c><00:03:12.599><c> do</c><00:03:12.840><c> this</c><00:03:13.080><c> is</c><00:03:13.680><c> because</c><00:03:14.680><c> if</c>

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 align:start position:0%
reason why they do this is because if
 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.550 align:start position:0%
reason why they do this is because if
they<00:03:15.120><c> gave</c><00:03:15.440><c> people</c><00:03:16.040><c> full</c><00:03:16.400><c> access</c><00:03:16.680><c> to</c><00:03:16.840><c> their</c><00:03:17.040><c> UI</c>

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
they gave people full access to their UI
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.509 align:start position:0%
they gave people full access to their UI
and<00:03:17.760><c> settings</c><00:03:18.720><c> with</c><00:03:19.040><c> tap</c><00:03:19.879><c> no</c><00:03:20.000><c> one</c><00:03:20.159><c> would</c><00:03:20.319><c> use</c>

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
and settings with tap no one would use
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.030 align:start position:0%
and settings with tap no one would use
