00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that this button can
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that this button can
do<00:02:47.800><c> is</c><00:02:47.879><c> that</c><00:02:48.040><c> it</c><00:02:48.120><c> can</c><00:02:48.319><c> launch</c><00:02:49.120><c> camera</c><00:02:49.400><c> controls</c>

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
do is that it can launch camera controls
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.949 align:start position:0%
do is that it can launch camera controls
so<00:02:49.879><c> they</c><00:02:50.000><c> actually</c><00:02:50.159><c> don't</c><00:02:50.319><c> refer</c><00:02:50.599><c> to</c><00:02:50.760><c> this</c>

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
so they actually don't refer to this
 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.910 align:start position:0%
so they actually don't refer to this

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
whole button thing as a button they
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.710 align:start position:0%
whole button thing as a button they
actually<00:02:53.120><c> call</c><00:02:53.280><c> it</c><00:02:53.920><c> camera</c><00:02:54.159><c> control</c><00:02:54.560><c> every</c>

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
actually call it camera control every
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.229 align:start position:0%
actually call it camera control every
time<00:02:54.840><c> I</c><00:02:54.959><c> use</c><00:02:55.120><c> the</c><00:02:55.239><c> word</c><00:02:55.440><c> button</c><00:02:55.760><c> in</c><00:02:55.879><c> front</c><00:02:56.080><c> of</c>

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
time I use the word button in front of
 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.589 align:start position:0%

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
the Apple reps they be like no no no
 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.430 align:start position:0%
the Apple reps they be like no no no
it's<00:02:57.720><c> not</c><00:02:57.879><c> actually</c><00:02:58.080><c> a</c><00:02:58.200><c> button</c><00:02:58.760><c> it's</c><00:02:58.959><c> called</c>

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's not actually a button it's called
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.470 align:start position:0%
it's not actually a button it's called
camera<00:02:59.640><c> control</c><00:02:59.840><c> control</c><00:03:00.400><c> so</c><00:03:00.680><c> you</c><00:03:00.800><c> can</c><00:03:01.080><c> use</c>

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
camera control control so you can use
 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.430 align:start position:0%
camera control control so you can use
this<00:03:02.200><c> camera</c><00:03:02.480><c> control</c><00:03:03.080><c> to</c><00:03:03.360><c> launch</c><00:03:04.000><c> the</c><00:03:04.120><c> camera</c>

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
this camera control to launch the camera
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.990 align:start position:0%
this camera control to launch the camera
so<00:03:04.560><c> if</c><00:03:04.640><c> you</c><00:03:05.000><c> tap</c><00:03:05.280><c> it</c><00:03:05.640><c> it'll</c><00:03:05.920><c> launch</c><00:03:06.200><c> the</c><00:03:06.360><c> camera</c>

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
so if you tap it it'll launch the camera
 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.149 align:start position:0%
so if you tap it it'll launch the camera
app<00:03:07.440><c> and</c><00:03:07.519><c> if</c><00:03:07.599><c> you</c><00:03:07.879><c> tap</c><00:03:08.040><c> it</c><00:03:08.200><c> again</c><00:03:08.599><c> it'll</c><00:03:08.879><c> take</c><00:03:09.040><c> a</c>

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
app and if you tap it again it'll take a
 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
app and if you tap it again it'll take a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
basic camera controls you can use it to
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
basic camera controls you can use it to

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
go through the menus and basically just
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.670 align:start position:0%
go through the menus and basically just
control<00:03:18.400><c> your</c><00:03:18.720><c> camera</c><00:03:19.400><c> through</c><00:03:19.640><c> a</c><00:03:19.879><c> UI</c><00:03:20.400><c> that's</c>

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
control your camera through a UI that's
 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
control your camera through a UI that's

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 align:start position:0%

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.629 align:start position:0%
10 there's a few interesting changes

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
first it's thinner which was immediately
 

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:31.110 align:start position:0%
first it's thinner which was immediately

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%

charging<00:12:04.440><c> coils</c><00:12:04.760><c> so</c><00:12:04.880><c> you</c><00:12:04.959><c> can</c><00:12:05.079><c> now</c><00:12:05.240><c> charge</c>

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
charging coils so you can now charge
 

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:07.829 align:start position:0%
charging coils so you can now charge

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
faster using the same charging puck as
 

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:09.870 align:start position:0%
faster using the same charging puck as
before<00:12:08.200><c> it's</c><00:12:08.360><c> just</c><00:12:08.519><c> a</c><00:12:08.639><c> more</c><00:12:09.160><c> efficient</c><00:12:09.600><c> coil</c>

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
before it's just a more efficient coil
 

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
before it's just a more efficient coil
so<00:12:10.000><c> it</c><00:12:10.120><c> just</c><00:12:10.480><c> charges</c><00:12:10.920><c> faster</c><00:12:11.200><c> I</c><00:12:11.279><c> think</c><00:12:11.360><c> you</c>

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
so it just charges faster I think you
 

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.230 align:start position:0%
so it just charges faster I think you
