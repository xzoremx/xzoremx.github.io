00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
think are noteworthy right now so first
 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.630 align:start position:0%
think are noteworthy right now so first
is<00:00:48.840><c> that</c><00:00:49.000><c> there</c><00:00:49.199><c> is</c><00:00:49.320><c> an</c><00:00:49.520><c> ANC</c><00:00:50.000><c> option</c><00:00:50.239><c> now</c><00:00:50.480><c> you</c>

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
is that there is an ANC option now you
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.270 align:start position:0%
is that there is an ANC option now you
have<00:00:50.800><c> the</c><00:00:51.000><c> option</c><00:00:51.280><c> to</c><00:00:51.559><c> buy</c><00:00:52.039><c> a</c><00:00:52.359><c> airpod</c><00:00:53.039><c> 4</c><00:00:53.760><c> with</c>

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
active noise cancellation second there's
 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.270 align:start position:0%
active noise cancellation second there's
the<00:00:56.520><c> presence</c><00:00:56.840><c> of</c><00:00:56.960><c> the</c><00:00:57.079><c> H2</c><00:00:57.480><c> chip</c><00:00:57.760><c> this</c><00:00:57.920><c> time</c><00:00:58.079><c> so</c>

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
the presence of the H2 chip this time so
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.590 align:start position:0%
the presence of the H2 chip this time so
this<00:00:58.440><c> helps</c><00:00:58.680><c> with</c><00:00:58.800><c> that</c><00:00:58.920><c> an</c><00:00:59.039><c> ANC</c><00:00:59.320><c> but</c><00:00:59.440><c> also</c>

fit<00:01:16.360><c> so</c><00:01:16.560><c> this</c><00:01:16.680><c> was</c><00:01:16.840><c> the</c><00:01:16.960><c> fit</c><00:01:17.200><c> of</c><00:01:17.360><c> airpods</c><00:01:17.880><c> 1</c><00:01:18.159><c> and</c>

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
fit so this was the fit of airpods 1 and
 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.590 align:start position:0%

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
sound but we'll see and lastly we have
 

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.630 align:start position:0%

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
also use the H2 chip but because this is
 

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
also use the H2 chip but because this is
a<00:09:14.000><c> more</c><00:09:14.279><c> expensive</c><00:09:15.040><c> device</c><00:09:15.399><c> and</c><00:09:15.560><c> these</c><00:09:15.680><c> are</c>

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
a more expensive device and these are
