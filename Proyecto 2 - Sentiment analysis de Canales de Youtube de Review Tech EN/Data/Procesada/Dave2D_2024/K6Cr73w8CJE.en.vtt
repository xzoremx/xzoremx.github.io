uh<00:04:34.440><c> I</c><00:04:34.600><c> imagine</c><00:04:34.919><c> that</c><00:04:35.039><c> if</c><00:04:35.120><c> you</c><00:04:35.280><c> ever</c><00:04:35.560><c> like</c>

uh I imagine that if you ever like
 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.710 align:start position:0%
uh I imagine that if you ever like
cranked<00:04:36.360><c> this</c><00:04:36.479><c> thing</c><00:04:36.639><c> and</c><00:04:36.759><c> you</c><00:04:37.080><c> broke</c><00:04:37.360><c> it</c>

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
cranked this thing and you broke it
 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
cranked this thing and you broke it
because<00:04:38.039><c> it's</c><00:04:38.280><c> got</c><00:04:38.759><c> screw</c><00:04:39.199><c> points</c><00:04:39.520><c> here</c><00:04:39.880><c> you</c>

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
because it's got screw points here you
 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.469 align:start position:0%
because it's got screw points here you
could<00:04:40.240><c> just</c><00:04:41.080><c> replace</c><00:04:41.479><c> the</c><00:04:42.080><c> hinge</c><00:04:43.080><c> if</c><00:04:43.199><c> you</c><00:04:43.320><c> ever</c>

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
could just replace the hinge if you ever
 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
could just replace the hinge if you ever
needed<00:04:43.800><c> to</c><00:04:44.759><c> but</c><00:04:45.039><c> just</c><00:04:45.199><c> from</c><00:04:45.560><c> the</c><00:04:46.560><c> it's</c><00:04:46.759><c> just</c><00:04:47.000><c> so</c>

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
needed to but just from the it's just so
 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.230 align:start position:0%
needed to but just from the it's just so
solid<00:04:48.199><c> and</c><00:04:48.639><c> because</c><00:04:49.639><c> it's</c><00:04:49.840><c> got</c><00:04:50.120><c> these</c><00:04:50.800><c> angles</c>

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%

on<00:04:51.400><c> it</c><00:04:51.680><c> these</c><00:04:51.880><c> bevels</c><00:04:52.240><c> on</c><00:04:52.400><c> it</c><00:04:53.000><c> you</c><00:04:53.120><c> can</c><00:04:53.280><c> use</c><00:04:53.479><c> it</c>

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
on it these bevels on it you can use it
 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.270 align:start position:0%
on it these bevels on it you can use it
as<00:04:54.240><c> two</c><00:04:54.560><c> vertical</c><00:04:54.960><c> screens</c><00:04:55.360><c> and</c><00:04:55.479><c> they'll</c><00:04:55.680><c> auto</c>

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
as two vertical screens and they'll auto
 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.790 align:start position:0%
as two vertical screens and they'll auto

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
1920x 1200 screen so it's like just low
 

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
1920x 1200 screen so it's like just low
resolution<00:08:05.039><c> but</c><00:08:05.159><c> it</c><00:08:05.280><c> still</c><00:08:05.560><c> has</c><00:08:06.039><c> 500</c><00:08:06.479><c> nits</c><00:08:06.759><c> and</c>

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%

still<00:08:07.199><c> has</c><00:08:08.039><c> uh</c><00:08:08.159><c> the</c><00:08:08.319><c> 100%</c><00:08:08.720><c> DC3</c><00:08:09.440><c> so</c><00:08:09.560><c> I</c><00:08:09.639><c> think</c><00:08:09.919><c> on</c>

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
still has uh the 100% DC3 so I think on
 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.430 align:start position:0%
still has uh the 100% DC3 so I think on
a<00:08:10.280><c> product</c><00:08:10.599><c> like</c><00:08:10.960><c> that</c><00:08:11.960><c> because</c><00:08:12.199><c> these</c><00:08:12.319><c> are</c>

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
a product like that because these are
 

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
a product like that because these are
14-inch<00:08:12.960><c> screens</c><00:08:13.319><c> right</c><00:08:13.440><c> for</c><00:08:13.560><c> someone</c><00:08:13.879><c> that's</c>

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
14-inch screens right for someone that's
 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.189 align:start position:0%

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of 14-in laptops I feel like
 

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.749 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of 14-in laptops I feel like
most<00:08:17.440><c> people</c><00:08:17.639><c> should</c><00:08:17.879><c> opt</c><00:08:18.120><c> for</c><00:08:18.280><c> that</c><00:08:18.440><c> lower</c>

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
most people should opt for that lower
 

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.710 align:start position:0%
most people should opt for that lower
resolution<00:08:19.240><c> screen</c><00:08:20.199><c> the</c><00:08:20.280><c> biggest</c><00:08:20.520><c> thing</c><00:08:20.639><c> is</c>

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
resolution screen the biggest thing is
 

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.350 align:start position:0%
resolution screen the biggest thing is
that<00:08:20.840><c> you're</c><00:08:20.960><c> driving</c><00:08:21.319><c> two</c><00:08:21.599><c> screens</c><00:08:22.080><c> here</c>

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
that you're driving two screens here
 

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.149 align:start position:0%
that you're driving two screens here
right<00:08:22.560><c> so</c><00:08:22.840><c> there's</c><00:08:23.000><c> just</c><00:08:23.199><c> more</c><00:08:23.520><c> pressure</c><00:08:24.000><c> on</c>

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
right so there's just more pressure on
 

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:27.710 align:start position:0%

like<00:08:46.720><c> this</c><00:08:47.080><c> so</c><00:08:47.240><c> the</c><00:08:47.440><c> one</c><00:08:47.640><c> thing</c><00:08:47.800><c> I</c><00:08:47.880><c> thought</c><00:08:48.040><c> was</c>

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
like this so the one thing I thought was
 

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
like this so the one thing I thought was
neat<00:08:48.760><c> was</c><00:08:48.920><c> you</c><00:08:49.000><c> can</c><00:08:49.200><c> adjust</c><00:08:49.600><c> the</c><00:08:49.720><c> brightness</c>

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
neat was you can adjust the brightness
 

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.190 align:start position:0%
neat was you can adjust the brightness
of<00:08:50.200><c> the</c><00:08:50.279><c> screens</c><00:08:50.720><c> independently</c><00:08:51.360><c> so</c><00:08:51.560><c> this</c><00:08:51.680><c> is</c>

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the screens independently so this is
 

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.949 align:start position:0%
of the screens independently so this is
like<00:08:52.680><c> super</c><00:08:52.959><c> useful</c><00:08:53.360><c> you</c><00:08:53.440><c> can</c><00:08:53.560><c> have</c><00:08:53.720><c> like</c><00:08:53.800><c> a</c>

00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
like super useful you can have like a

this is not connected to the system this
 

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
this is not connected to the system this
is<00:11:34.760><c> just</c><00:11:34.880><c> to</c><00:11:35.079><c> charge</c><00:11:35.480><c> the</c><00:11:35.639><c> wireless</c><00:11:36.000><c> keyboard</c>

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
