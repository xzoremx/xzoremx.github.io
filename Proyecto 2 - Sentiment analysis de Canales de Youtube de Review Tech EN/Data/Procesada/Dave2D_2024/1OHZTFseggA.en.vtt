seemed like this very mild iterative
change<00:00:15.679><c> and</c><00:00:16.000><c> I</c><00:00:16.080><c> think</c><00:00:16.240><c> it's</c><00:00:16.520><c> because</c><00:00:16.840><c> they</c><00:00:17.000><c> use</c>

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
change and I think it's because they use
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
change and I think it's because they use

that it's a wildly allnew design but

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
does it and it's because they weren't
 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.150 align:start position:0%
does it and it's because they weren't
referring<00:00:31.759><c> so</c><00:00:31.880><c> much</c><00:00:32.000><c> to</c><00:00:32.160><c> the</c><00:00:32.279><c> Aesthetics</c><00:00:33.000><c> but</c>

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
more about how the design has a lot of
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.869 align:start position:0%
more about how the design has a lot of
new<00:00:35.280><c> functional</c><00:00:35.719><c> features</c><00:00:36.680><c> so</c><00:00:37.079><c> the</c><00:00:37.280><c> big</c><00:00:37.520><c> thing</c>

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 align:start position:0%
new functional features so the big thing
 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
new functional features so the big thing
that<00:00:38.040><c> they're</c><00:00:38.200><c> touting</c><00:00:38.680><c> is</c><00:00:39.079><c> the</c><00:00:39.200><c> bigger</c>

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
that they're touting is the bigger
 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
that they're touting is the bigger
screen<00:00:40.079><c> which</c><00:00:40.200><c> was</c><00:00:40.440><c> a</c><00:00:40.520><c> little</c><00:00:40.719><c> misleading</c><00:00:41.160><c> in</c>

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
screen which was a little misleading in
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
screen which was a little misleading in
the<00:00:41.360><c> marketing</c><00:00:41.719><c> material</c><00:00:42.120><c> because</c><00:00:42.360><c> when</c><00:00:42.480><c> they</c>

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
the marketing material because when they
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.430 align:start position:0%
the marketing material because when they
say<00:00:42.760><c> it's</c><00:00:42.920><c> 30%</c><00:00:43.520><c> bigger</c><00:00:43.879><c> they</c><00:00:43.960><c> were</c><00:00:44.120><c> comparing</c>

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
say it's 30% bigger they were comparing
 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.389 align:start position:0%
say it's 30% bigger they were comparing
it<00:00:44.520><c> to</c><00:00:44.680><c> series</c><00:00:44.960><c> 4</c><00:00:45.360><c> 5</c><00:00:45.760><c> and</c><00:00:46.000><c> 6</c><00:00:46.600><c> so</c><00:00:46.879><c> if</c><00:00:47.000><c> you</c><00:00:47.120><c> do</c>

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 align:start position:0%

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.389 align:start position:0%
it to series 4 5 and 6 so if you do
compare<00:00:47.760><c> to</c><00:00:47.920><c> older</c><00:00:48.239><c> watches</c><00:00:48.640><c> like</c><00:00:48.840><c> Series</c><00:00:49.160><c> 2</c>

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 align:start position:0%

think it's more noticeable on certain

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's interesting on the display so
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
that's interesting on the display so

they just made it thinner I think at

they just made it thinner I think at

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
watch their target is 18 hours and you
 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.710 align:start position:0%
watch their target is 18 hours and you

know anything beyond that any Tech that
 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.790 align:start position:0%
know anything beyond that any Tech that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
they have access to that could extend it
 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.029 align:start position:0%
they have access to that could extend it
I<00:06:07.880><c> don't</c><00:06:08.039><c> think</c><00:06:08.199><c> they</c><00:06:08.319><c> go</c><00:06:08.479><c> for</c><00:06:08.639><c> it</c><00:06:08.800><c> they</c><00:06:08.880><c> just</c>

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
I don't think they go for it they just
 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.350 align:start position:0%
I don't think they go for it they just
go<00:06:09.160><c> for</c><00:06:09.400><c> like</c><00:06:09.520><c> a</c><00:06:09.759><c> smaller</c><00:06:10.199><c> package</c><00:06:10.919><c> and</c><00:06:11.199><c> at</c>

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
go for like a smaller package and at
 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.150 align:start position:0%
go for like a smaller package and at

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then I thought about it and I did
 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.070 align:start position:0%
and then I thought about it and I did

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
have this thought I tried to see from
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.670 align:start position:0%
have this thought I tried to see from

wouldn't they extend the battery that's

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
say they did extend the battery to let's
 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.390 align:start position:0%
say they did extend the battery to let's
say<00:06:28.400><c> like</c><00:06:28.919><c> 22</c><00:06:29.599><c> hours</c><00:06:30.080><c> 24</c><00:06:30.560><c> hours</c><00:06:30.919><c> right</c><00:06:31.080><c> somehow</c>
