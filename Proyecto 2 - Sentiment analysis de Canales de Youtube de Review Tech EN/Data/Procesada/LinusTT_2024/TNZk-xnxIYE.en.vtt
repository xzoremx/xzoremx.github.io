watching<00:10:14.519><c> TV</c><00:10:15.440><c> in</c><00:10:15.600><c> the</c><00:10:15.680><c> 9s</c><00:10:16.519><c> no</c><00:10:17.200><c> we</c><00:10:17.480><c> had</c><00:10:17.720><c> more</c>

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
watching TV in the 9s no we had more
 

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
watching TV in the 9s no we had more
color<00:10:18.519><c> than</c><00:10:19.120><c> that</c><00:10:20.120><c> the</c><00:10:20.480><c> contrast</c><00:10:21.519><c> is</c><00:10:22.519><c> terrible</c>

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
color than that the contrast is terrible
 

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.670 align:start position:0%
color than that the contrast is terrible
fine<00:10:24.120><c> yeah</c><00:10:24.839><c> terrible</c><00:10:25.839><c> so</c><00:10:26.040><c> I</c><00:10:26.200><c> guess</c><00:10:26.399><c> what</c><00:10:26.519><c> we</c>

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
fine yeah terrible so I guess what we
 

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.150 align:start position:0%
fine yeah terrible so I guess what we
want<00:10:26.800><c> to</c><00:10:27.079><c> know</c><00:10:27.920><c> is</c><00:10:28.200><c> how</c><00:10:28.360><c> much</c><00:10:28.560><c> of</c><00:10:28.680><c> what</c><00:10:28.800><c> we're</c>

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
want to know is how much of what we're
 

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
want to know is how much of what we're
looking<00:10:29.440><c> at</c><00:10:29.880><c> is</c><00:10:30.839><c> limitations</c><00:10:31.440><c> of</c><00:10:31.600><c> the</c><00:10:31.720><c> betamax</c>

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
looking at is limitations of the betamax
 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
looking at is limitations of the betamax
format<00:10:32.920><c> and</c><00:10:33.120><c> or</c><00:10:33.600><c> degradation</c><00:10:34.160><c> of</c><00:10:34.320><c> the</c><00:10:34.480><c> tape</c>

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
format and or degradation of the tape
 

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.150 align:start position:0%
format and or degradation of the tape
versus<00:10:35.519><c> how</c><00:10:35.639><c> much</c><00:10:35.800><c> of</c><00:10:35.920><c> it</c><00:10:36.079><c> is</c><00:10:36.360><c> limitations</c><00:10:36.959><c> of</c>

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
versus how much of it is limitations of
 

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.190 align:start position:0%
versus how much of it is limitations of
the<00:10:37.320><c> performance</c><00:10:37.839><c> of</c><00:10:38.000><c> our</c><00:10:38.200><c> projector</c><00:10:38.959><c> so</c><00:10:39.120><c> do</c>

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
the performance of our projector so do
 

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
the performance of our projector so do
we<00:10:39.320><c> want</c><00:10:39.399><c> to</c><00:10:39.519><c> throw</c><00:10:39.680><c> our</c><00:10:39.839><c> DVD</c><00:10:40.240><c> on</c><00:10:40.519><c> yeah</c><00:10:40.639><c> let's</c>

00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
the player okay I love how delightfully
 

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.829 align:start position:0%
the player okay I love how delightfully
easy<00:10:44.880><c> to</c><00:10:45.160><c> operate</c><00:10:45.600><c> this</c><00:10:45.760><c> thing</c><00:10:45.959><c> is</c><00:10:46.399><c> yeah</c><00:10:46.639><c> it's</c>

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
easy to operate this thing is yeah it's
 

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.629 align:start position:0%
easy to operate this thing is yeah it's
pretty<00:10:47.040><c> simple</c><00:10:47.519><c> switches</c><00:10:48.079><c> for</c><00:10:48.320><c> different</c>

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
pretty simple switches for different
 

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:52.389 align:start position:0%
pretty simple switches for different
modes<00:10:49.360><c> y</c><00:10:50.040><c> this</c><00:10:50.240><c> looks</c><00:10:50.600><c> better</c><00:10:51.600><c> I</c><00:10:51.800><c> think</c><00:10:52.120><c> that</c>

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
modes y this looks better I think that
 

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:57.230 align:start position:0%
modes y this looks better I think that
other<00:10:52.639><c> than</c><00:10:53.079><c> getting</c><00:10:53.560><c> 16</c><00:10:54.480><c> by9</c><00:10:55.720><c> M</c><00:10:56.720><c> which</c><00:10:56.880><c> we</c><00:10:57.000><c> can</c>

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
other than getting 16 by9 M which we can
 

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.030 align:start position:0%
other than getting 16 by9 M which we can
actually<00:10:57.880><c> kind</c><00:10:58.079><c> of</c><00:10:58.320><c> take</c><00:10:58.560><c> advantage</c><00:10:59.320><c> of</c><00:10:59.639><c> with</c>

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
actually kind of take advantage of with
 

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.430 align:start position:0%
actually kind of take advantage of with
this<00:11:00.399><c> projector</c><00:11:01.399><c> because</c><00:11:01.600><c> the</c><00:11:01.760><c> image</c><00:11:01.959><c> isn't</c>

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
this projector because the image isn't
 

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
this projector because the image isn't
so<00:11:03.279><c> small</c><00:11:03.880><c> that</c><00:11:04.079><c> you</c><00:11:04.440><c> are</c><00:11:04.720><c> basically</c><00:11:05.160><c> just</c>

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
so small that you are basically just
 

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.670 align:start position:0%
so small that you are basically just
like<00:11:05.920><c> well</c><00:11:06.920><c> I</c><00:11:07.120><c> gave</c><00:11:07.519><c> up</c><00:11:08.519><c> 30%</c><00:11:09.399><c> of</c><00:11:09.600><c> my</c><00:11:09.800><c> whole</c>

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
like well I gave up 30% of my whole
 

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.990 align:start position:0%
like well I gave up 30% of my whole
screen<00:11:12.680><c> I</c><00:11:12.760><c> don't</c><00:11:12.920><c> think</c><00:11:13.079><c> this</c><00:11:13.200><c> is</c><00:11:13.399><c> a</c><00:11:13.639><c> whole</c><00:11:14.360><c> ton</c>

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
screen I don't think this is a whole ton
 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
screen I don't think this is a whole ton
better<00:11:15.279><c> though</c><00:11:15.440><c> like</c><00:11:15.560><c> a</c><00:11:15.680><c> little</c><00:11:15.920><c> bit</c><00:11:16.160><c> I</c><00:11:16.240><c> think</c>

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
better though like a little bit I think
 

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.150 align:start position:0%
better though like a little bit I think
it's<00:11:16.440><c> a</c><00:11:16.560><c> little</c><00:11:16.720><c> better</c><00:11:17.040><c> a</c><00:11:17.160><c> little</c><00:11:17.399><c> bit</c>

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's a little better a little bit
 

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.230 align:start position:0%
it's a little better a little bit
looking<00:11:18.440><c> into</c><00:11:18.680><c> the</c><00:11:18.839><c> lens</c><00:11:19.279><c> this</c><00:11:19.360><c> is</c><00:11:19.600><c> as</c><00:11:19.880><c> bright</c>

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
