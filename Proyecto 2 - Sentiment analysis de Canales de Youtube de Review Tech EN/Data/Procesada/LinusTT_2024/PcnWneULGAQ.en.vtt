00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
that's sick we're not even GNA be able
 

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.230 align:start position:0%
that's sick we're not even GNA be able
to<00:14:05.639><c> realistically</c><00:14:06.240><c> do</c><00:14:06.519><c> that</c><00:14:06.880><c> so</c><00:14:07.680><c> yeah</c><00:14:08.000><c> that's</c>

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
to realistically do that so yeah that's
 

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.629 align:start position:0%
to realistically do that so yeah that's
great<00:14:08.560><c> but</c><00:14:08.720><c> most</c><00:14:08.880><c> of</c><00:14:09.040><c> what</c><00:14:09.120><c> we're</c><00:14:09.279><c> doing</c><00:14:09.480><c> on</c>

00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
great but most of what we're doing on
 

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:12.069 align:start position:0%
great but most of what we're doing on
this<00:14:09.759><c> thing</c><00:14:09.920><c> is</c><00:14:10.120><c> sequential</c><00:14:10.800><c> anyway</c><00:14:11.440><c> exactly</c>

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
this thing is sequential anyway exactly
 

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:15.150 align:start position:0%
this thing is sequential anyway exactly
that<00:14:12.199><c> is</c><00:14:12.440><c> like</c><00:14:13.079><c> five</c><00:14:13.440><c> to</c><00:14:13.680><c> seven</c><00:14:14.240><c> times</c><00:14:14.880><c> what</c><00:14:15.079><c> we</c>

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
that is like five to seven times what we
 

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.030 align:start position:0%
that is like five to seven times what we
would<00:14:15.320><c> even</c><00:14:15.480><c> be</c><00:14:15.639><c> doing</c><00:14:15.920><c> over</c><00:14:16.240><c> like</c><00:14:16.360><c> a</c><00:14:16.480><c> 10</c><00:14:16.800><c> gig</c>

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
would even be doing over like a 10 gig
 

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.870 align:start position:0%
would even be doing over like a 10 gig
connection<00:14:17.680><c> yeah</c><00:14:17.880><c> which</c><00:14:18.000><c> is</c><00:14:18.279><c> most</c><00:14:18.519><c> of</c><00:14:18.680><c> the</c>

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
connection yeah which is most of the
 

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.590 align:start position:0%
connection yeah which is most of the
accesses<00:14:19.440><c> we</c><00:14:19.560><c> do</c><00:14:19.839><c> except</c><00:14:20.079><c> when</c><00:14:20.160><c> we're</c><00:14:20.320><c> doing</c>

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
accesses we do except when we're doing
 

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.509 align:start position:0%
accesses we do except when we're doing
backups<00:14:20.959><c> and</c><00:14:21.120><c> stuff</c><00:14:21.320><c> anyways</c><00:14:21.759><c> so</c><00:14:22.279><c> great</c>
