a bad idea to have a well-rounded system
and<00:13:17.120><c> you've</c><00:13:17.279><c> got</c><00:13:17.399><c> to</c><00:13:17.560><c> give</c><00:13:17.760><c> the</c><00:13:18.000><c> professional</c>

00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
and you've got to give the professional
 

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:20.949 align:start position:0%
and you've got to give the professional
and<00:13:18.720><c> teenage</c><00:13:19.079><c> engineering</c><00:13:19.600><c> some</c><00:13:19.839><c> credit</c><00:13:20.199><c> here</c>

00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%

00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:25.389 align:start position:0%

so<00:13:21.800><c> I'm</c><00:13:21.920><c> going</c><00:13:22.040><c> to</c><00:13:22.240><c> say</c><00:13:22.880><c> maybe</c><00:13:23.880><c> you</c><00:13:24.040><c> know</c><00:13:24.519><c> eight</c>

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say maybe you know eight
 

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.350 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say maybe you know eight
for<00:13:25.600><c> the</c><00:13:25.760><c> hobbyist</c><00:13:26.320><c> because</c><00:13:26.519><c> we</c><00:13:26.680><c> did</c><00:13:26.920><c> give</c><00:13:27.079><c> up</c>

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
for the hobbyist because we did give up
 

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.269 align:start position:0%
for the hobbyist because we did give up
a<00:13:27.639><c> lot</c><00:13:27.959><c> in</c><00:13:28.079><c> terms</c><00:13:28.320><c> of</c><00:13:28.440><c> multi-threaded</c>

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.670 align:start position:0%
a lot in terms of multi-threaded

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.389 align:start position:0%
performance but given how much the other
ones<00:13:31.959><c> gave</c><00:13:32.160><c> up</c><00:13:32.680><c> everywhere</c><00:13:33.440><c> else</c><00:13:34.440><c> I'd</c><00:13:34.639><c> say</c><00:13:34.959><c> at</c>

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
ones gave up everywhere else I'd say at
 

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:37.629 align:start position:0%
ones gave up everywhere else I'd say at
best<00:13:35.920><c> they</c><00:13:36.040><c> can</c><00:13:36.199><c> have</c><00:13:36.360><c> a</c><00:13:36.600><c> five</c><00:13:37.279><c> five</c><00:13:37.480><c> is</c>

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:13:42.560><c> now</c><00:13:42.720><c> we</c><00:13:42.839><c> turn</c><00:13:43.079><c> to</c><00:13:43.360><c> value</c><00:13:43.680><c> and</c><00:13:43.800><c> you</c><00:13:43.959><c> might</c>

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
yeah now we turn to value and you might
 

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.069 align:start position:0%
yeah now we turn to value and you might
think<00:13:44.519><c> oh</c><00:13:44.680><c> well</c><00:13:44.839><c> line</c><00:13:45.000><c> is</c><00:13:45.240><c> that</c><00:13:45.480><c> simple</c><00:13:45.839><c> it's</c>

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
think oh well line is that simple it's
 

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:48.350 align:start position:0%
think oh well line is that simple it's
just<00:13:46.560><c> performance</c><00:13:47.240><c> versus</c><00:13:47.839><c> how</c><00:13:48.000><c> much</c><00:13:48.120><c> you</c>

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
just performance versus how much you
 

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.790 align:start position:0%
just performance versus how much you
paid<00:13:49.160><c> but</c><00:13:49.680><c> I</c><00:13:49.800><c> see</c><00:13:50.040><c> a</c><00:13:50.240><c> value</c><00:13:50.600><c> in</c><00:13:50.959><c> for</c><00:13:51.160><c> example</c>
