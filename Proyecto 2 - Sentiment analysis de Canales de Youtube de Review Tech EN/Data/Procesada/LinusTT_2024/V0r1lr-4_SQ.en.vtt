00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
so our ceilings are super
 

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.430 align:start position:0%
so our ceilings are super
high<00:08:49.040><c> so</c><00:08:49.200><c> you</c><00:08:49.279><c> can</c><00:08:49.480><c> basically</c><00:08:49.839><c> hit</c><00:08:49.959><c> it</c><00:08:50.120><c> as</c><00:08:50.279><c> high</c>

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
high so you can basically hit it as high
 

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
high so you can basically hit it as high
as<00:08:50.519><c> you</c>

you'll kind of be able to see any
 

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.670 align:start position:0%
you'll kind of be able to see any
who<00:15:39.720><c> it</c><00:15:39.839><c> sounds</c><00:15:40.199><c> like</c><00:15:40.399><c> that's</c><00:15:40.600><c> very</c><00:15:40.839><c> solvable</c>

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
who it sounds like that's very solvable

who it sounds like that's very solvable
and<00:15:41.839><c> we'll</c><00:15:42.079><c> just</c><00:15:42.240><c> run</c><00:15:42.480><c> an</c><00:15:42.639><c> ethernet</c><00:15:43.160><c> cable</c>

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll just run an ethernet cable
 

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.430 align:start position:0%
and we'll just run an ethernet cable
nicely<00:15:44.040><c> cable</c><00:15:44.279><c> managed</c><00:15:44.639><c> down</c><00:15:44.759><c> to</c><00:15:45.040><c> there</c><00:15:45.279><c> and</c>

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
nicely cable managed down to there and
 

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.470 align:start position:0%
nicely cable managed down to there and
point<00:15:45.639><c> it</c><00:15:45.800><c> that</c><00:15:45.880><c> way</c><00:15:46.079><c> I</c><00:15:46.120><c> have</c><00:15:46.199><c> a</c><00:15:46.279><c> better</c>

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
point it that way I have a better
 

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.350 align:start position:0%
point it that way I have a better
