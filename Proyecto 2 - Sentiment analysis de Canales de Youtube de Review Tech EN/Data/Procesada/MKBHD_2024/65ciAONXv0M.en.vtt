50 bucks so I think that Nets to the

and<00:07:09.039><c> I</c><00:07:09.400><c> understand</c><00:07:09.560><c> that</c><00:07:09.759><c> most</c><00:07:09.960><c> people</c><00:07:10.160><c> will</c>

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.590 align:start position:0%
general but that's something I can put

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
that takes longer this takes more time

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
so this is something like we know most

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
this app should be improving over time
 

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.189 align:start position:0%
this app should be improving over time
clearly<00:13:34.959><c> so</c><00:13:35.160><c> then</c><00:13:35.279><c> number</c><00:13:35.560><c> four</c><00:13:36.440><c> the</c><00:13:36.600><c> future</c>

00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
clearly so then number four the future
 

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:39.030 align:start position:0%
