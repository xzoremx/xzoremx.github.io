creator<00:00:53.320><c> so</c><00:00:53.600><c> an</c><00:00:53.800><c> AI</c><00:00:54.199><c> that's</c><00:00:54.480><c> actually</c><00:00:54.800><c> doing</c>

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 align:start position:0%

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
my job maybe that feels a little more
 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.830 align:start position:0%
my job maybe that feels a little more

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
threatening so I'm particularly
 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.869 align:start position:0%
threatening so I'm particularly

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 align:start position:0%
impressed by it but also so this this
 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.709 align:start position:0%
impressed by it but also so this this
stuff<00:01:01.160><c> is</c><00:01:01.559><c> really</c><00:01:01.920><c> good</c><00:01:02.280><c> so</c><00:01:02.440><c> today</c><00:01:02.960><c> Sam</c><00:01:03.239><c> Altman</c>

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
stuff is really good so today Sam Altman

and<00:01:03.879><c> open</c><00:01:04.119><c> AI</c><00:01:04.600><c> announced</c><00:01:05.080><c> a</c><00:01:05.239><c> new</c><00:01:05.519><c> model</c><00:01:06.320><c> called</c>

and open AI announced a new model called
sora<00:01:07.600><c> and</c><00:01:07.720><c> it</c><00:01:07.880><c> can</c><00:01:08.040><c> generate</c><00:01:08.479><c> full</c><00:01:09.119><c> up</c><00:01:09.320><c> to</c><00:01:09.520><c> one</c>

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
sora and it can generate full up to one

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
minute video clips from just text input
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.749 align:start position:0%

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 align:start position:0%
so the same way dolly was able to
 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.670 align:start position:0%
so the same way dolly was able to
