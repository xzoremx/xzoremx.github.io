00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
but uh these are again different and
 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.670 align:start position:0%
but uh these are again different and
there<00:05:43.440><c> are</c><00:05:43.600><c> a</c><00:05:43.680><c> bunch</c><00:05:43.840><c> of</c><00:05:43.960><c> other</c><00:05:44.080><c> earbuds</c><00:05:44.520><c> just</c>

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of other earbuds just
 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.950 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of other earbuds just
like<00:05:44.800><c> it</c><00:05:44.960><c> but</c><00:05:45.160><c> this</c><00:05:45.319><c> is</c><00:05:45.440><c> the</c><00:05:45.720><c> kind</c><00:05:46.600><c> that</c><00:05:46.960><c> gets</c>

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
like it but this is the kind that gets
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.350 align:start position:0%
like it but this is the kind that gets
curled<00:05:48.639><c> behind</c><00:05:49.000><c> your</c><00:05:49.199><c> ear</c><00:05:49.680><c> so</c><00:05:49.919><c> here's</c><00:05:50.160><c> how</c><00:05:50.240><c> it</c>

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
curled behind your ear so here's how it
 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.510 align:start position:0%
curled behind your ear so here's how it
works<00:05:50.560><c> you</c><00:05:50.680><c> curl</c><00:05:51.000><c> this</c><00:05:51.199><c> back</c><00:05:51.479><c> section</c><00:05:52.000><c> behind</c>

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
works you curl this back section behind
 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.670 align:start position:0%
works you curl this back section behind
and<00:05:52.600><c> then</c><00:05:52.720><c> it</c><00:05:52.880><c> goes</c><00:05:53.080><c> over</c><00:05:53.319><c> the</c><00:05:53.479><c> top</c><00:05:54.360><c> and</c><00:05:54.479><c> sort</c>

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
and then it goes over the top and sort
 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.350 align:start position:0%
and then it goes over the top and sort
of<00:05:54.800><c> floats</c><00:05:55.199><c> in</c><00:05:55.360><c> your</c><00:05:55.560><c> ear</c><00:05:56.560><c> like</c><00:05:56.919><c> that</c><00:05:57.199><c> so</c>

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
of floats in your ear like that so
 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.350 align:start position:0%
of floats in your ear like that so
there's<00:05:57.720><c> a</c><00:05:58.120><c> definitely</c><00:05:58.479><c> an</c><00:05:58.639><c> ear</c><00:05:59.000><c> an</c><00:05:59.120><c> air</c><00:05:59.400><c> gap</c>

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
there's a definitely an ear an air gap
 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.189 align:start position:0%
there's a definitely an ear an air gap
between<00:06:00.759><c> my</c><00:06:00.960><c> ear</c><00:06:01.800><c> and</c><00:06:01.919><c> the</c><00:06:02.080><c> bud</c><00:06:02.400><c> which</c><00:06:02.520><c> is</c>

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
floating uh and it also looks different
 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.309 align:start position:0%
floating uh and it also looks different
I<00:06:07.240><c> would</c><00:06:07.440><c> say</c><00:06:07.800><c> I</c><00:06:07.840><c> mean</c><00:06:08.080><c> this</c><00:06:08.199><c> is</c><00:06:08.440><c> not</c><00:06:08.759><c> going</c><00:06:08.880><c> to</c>

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
I would say I mean this is not going to

happen to be in this form factor that's

happen to be in this form factor that's

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
much with the whole hook behind the ear
 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
much with the whole hook behind the ear
thing<00:07:21.280><c> this</c><00:07:21.520><c> is</c><00:07:21.840><c> though</c><00:07:22.000><c> a</c><00:07:22.160><c> bigger</c><00:07:22.479><c> driver</c>

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
thing this is though a bigger driver
 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.070 align:start position:0%
thing this is though a bigger driver
covering<00:07:23.360><c> more</c><00:07:23.759><c> of</c><00:07:23.919><c> the</c><00:07:24.039><c> opening</c><00:07:24.400><c> to</c><00:07:24.560><c> the</c><00:07:24.720><c> ear</c>

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
covering more of the opening to the ear
 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.350 align:start position:0%
covering more of the opening to the ear
so<00:07:25.280><c> you</c><00:07:25.479><c> actually</c><00:07:25.800><c> do</c><00:07:26.080><c> get</c><00:07:26.280><c> a</c><00:07:26.400><c> bit</c><00:07:26.599><c> more</c><00:07:26.879><c> bass</c>

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
so you actually do get a bit more bass
 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
so you actually do get a bit more bass
and<00:07:27.560><c> a</c><00:07:27.759><c> closer</c><00:07:28.160><c> sound</c><00:07:28.479><c> to</c><00:07:28.680><c> normal</c><00:07:29.000><c> earbuds</c>

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
then they have this interesting feature
 

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
then they have this interesting feature
and<00:09:13.560><c> I've</c><00:09:13.680><c> been</c><00:09:13.800><c> trying</c><00:09:14.000><c> to</c><00:09:14.120><c> figure</c><00:09:14.320><c> out</c><00:09:14.640><c> why</c>

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
and I've been trying to figure out why
 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.590 align:start position:0%
and I've been trying to figure out why
they<00:09:14.959><c> did</c><00:09:15.200><c> this</c><00:09:15.560><c> and</c><00:09:15.680><c> it's</c><00:09:15.880><c> still</c><00:09:16.120><c> not</c><00:09:16.320><c> super</c>

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
they did this and it's still not super
 

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.949 align:start position:0%
they did this and it's still not super
clear<00:09:16.880><c> to</c><00:09:17.000><c> me</c><00:09:17.279><c> but</c><00:09:17.480><c> they</c><00:09:17.600><c> can</c>

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
clear to me but they can
 

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:22.670 align:start position:0%
clear to me but they can
pivot<00:09:19.959><c> like</c><00:09:20.519><c> that</c><00:09:21.519><c> and</c><00:09:21.880><c> that</c><00:09:22.000><c> sort</c><00:09:22.160><c> of</c><00:09:22.320><c> tilts</c>

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
pivot like that and that sort of tilts
 

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.710 align:start position:0%
pivot like that and that sort of tilts
the<00:09:22.839><c> driver</c><00:09:23.440><c> backwards</c><00:09:24.440><c> when</c><00:09:24.560><c> you're</c>

listening to music or when you have a
 

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.069 align:start position:0%
listening to music or when you have a

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
phone call going and you tilt the
 

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:31.230 align:start position:0%
phone call going and you tilt the
drivers<00:09:29.040><c> it</c><00:09:29.399><c> tilts</c><00:09:29.720><c> them</c><00:09:30.079><c> away</c><00:09:30.320><c> from</c><00:09:30.480><c> your</c><00:09:30.680><c> ear</c>

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
drivers it tilts them away from your ear
 

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
drivers it tilts them away from your ear
and<00:09:31.360><c> so</c><00:09:31.519><c> it</c><00:09:31.680><c> becomes</c><00:09:32.200><c> really</c><00:09:32.480><c> muffled</c><00:09:32.920><c> and</c><00:09:33.040><c> I</c>

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so it becomes really muffled and I
 

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.190 align:start position:0%
and so it becomes really muffled and I
don't<00:09:33.240><c> hear</c><00:09:33.399><c> it</c><00:09:33.560><c> very</c><00:09:33.720><c> well</c><00:09:33.920><c> anymore</c><00:09:34.920><c> but</c><00:09:35.040><c> if</c>

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
pivot them back into your ears so both
 

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:23.190 align:start position:0%
pivot them back into your ears so both
work<00:10:22.120><c> and</c><00:10:22.279><c> you</c><00:10:22.399><c> can</c><00:10:22.560><c> play</c><00:10:22.720><c> with</c><00:10:22.839><c> the</c><00:10:23.000><c> height</c>

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.829 align:start position:0%
work and you can play with the height
too<00:10:23.480><c> to</c><00:10:23.600><c> kind</c><00:10:23.680><c> of</c><00:10:23.920><c> get</c><00:10:24.040><c> them</c><00:10:24.279><c> just</c><00:10:24.519><c> right</c><00:10:24.720><c> so</c>

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
too to kind of get them just right so
 

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:26.990 align:start position:0%
too to kind of get them just right so
that's<00:10:25.120><c> probably</c><00:10:25.360><c> the</c><00:10:25.480><c> point</c><00:10:25.640><c> of</c><00:10:25.760><c> the</c><00:10:26.000><c> pivot</c>

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's probably the point of the pivot
 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.710 align:start position:0%
that's probably the point of the pivot

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
in here but the issue is basically that
 

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.190 align:start position:0%
in here but the issue is basically that
your<00:11:52.560><c> ear</c><00:11:52.800><c> is</c><00:11:52.959><c> in</c><00:11:53.079><c> the</c><00:11:53.279><c> middle</c><00:11:53.600><c> and</c><00:11:53.760><c> you</c><00:11:53.920><c> want</c>

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
your ear is in the middle and you want
 

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.990 align:start position:0%
your ear is in the middle and you want
the<00:11:54.360><c> sound</c><00:11:54.600><c> to</c><00:11:54.800><c> come</c><00:11:55.079><c> through</c><00:11:55.839><c> the</c><00:11:56.040><c> middle</c><00:11:56.839><c> and</c>

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
the sound to come through the middle and
 

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
the sound to come through the middle and
it<00:11:57.160><c> doesn't</c><00:11:57.639><c> which</c><00:11:57.760><c> is</c><00:11:58.000><c> why</c><00:11:58.360><c> these</c><00:11:59.279><c> end</c><00:11:59.480><c> up</c>

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't which is why these end up
 

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.030 align:start position:0%
it doesn't which is why these end up
sounding<00:12:00.399><c> better</c><00:12:00.920><c> which</c><00:12:01.040><c> is</c><00:12:01.279><c> crazy</c><00:12:01.680><c> but</c><00:12:01.839><c> it's</c>

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
sounding better which is crazy but it's
 

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.110 align:start position:0%
sounding better which is crazy but it's
because<00:12:02.360><c> they</c><00:12:02.560><c> point</c><00:12:02.880><c> the</c><00:12:03.040><c> audio</c><00:12:03.639><c> directly</c>

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
because they point the audio directly
 

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.949 align:start position:0%
because they point the audio directly
into<00:12:04.399><c> your</c><00:12:04.600><c> ear</c><00:12:05.519><c> so</c><00:12:06.040><c> these</c><00:12:07.040><c> they</c><00:12:07.480><c> have</c><00:12:07.720><c> this</c>

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
into your ear so these they have this
 

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:10.670 align:start position:0%
into your ear so these they have this
interesting<00:12:08.519><c> look</c><00:12:09.120><c> and</c><00:12:09.920><c> it's</c><00:12:10.040><c> so</c><00:12:10.320><c> cool</c>

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
interesting look and it's so cool
 

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.509 align:start position:0%
interesting look and it's so cool
because<00:12:11.000><c> yes</c><00:12:11.160><c> it</c><00:12:11.279><c> works</c><00:12:11.680><c> I</c><00:12:11.800><c> can</c><00:12:12.079><c> hear</c><00:12:12.399><c> the</c>

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
because yes it works I can hear the
 

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:15.230 align:start position:0%
because yes it works I can hear the
outside<00:12:13.000><c> world</c><00:12:13.320><c> when</c><00:12:13.440><c> I</c><00:12:13.600><c> put</c><00:12:13.760><c> them</c><00:12:13.920><c> on</c><00:12:14.920><c> but</c>

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
outside world when I put them on but
 

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
outside world when I put them on but
it's<00:12:15.480><c> also</c><00:12:15.800><c> now</c><00:12:16.000><c> a</c><00:12:16.120><c> little</c><00:12:16.240><c> bit</c><00:12:16.399><c> more</c><00:12:16.560><c> muffled</c>

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's also now a little bit more muffled
 

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.509 align:start position:0%
it's also now a little bit more muffled
because<00:12:17.279><c> there's</c><00:12:17.440><c> still</c><00:12:17.680><c> this</c><00:12:17.920><c> cavity</c><00:12:18.279><c> around</c>

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
because there's still this cavity around
 

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.670 align:start position:0%
because there's still this cavity around
my<00:12:18.680><c> ear</c><00:12:19.279><c> and</c><00:12:19.399><c> it</c><00:12:19.600><c> actually</c><00:12:19.800><c> suffered</c><00:12:20.199><c> for</c><00:12:20.399><c> that</c>

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
my ear and it actually suffered for that
 

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.949 align:start position:0%
my ear and it actually suffered for that
so<00:12:21.360><c> as</c><00:12:21.639><c> much</c><00:12:21.839><c> as</c><00:12:22.079><c> these</c><00:12:22.279><c> look</c><00:12:22.519><c> like</c><00:12:22.680><c> they'd</c><00:12:22.839><c> be</c>

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
so as much as these look like they'd be
 

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:24.910 align:start position:0%
so as much as these look like they'd be
better<00:12:23.240><c> and</c><00:12:23.360><c> more</c><00:12:23.519><c> like</c><00:12:23.680><c> real</c><00:12:23.920><c> headphones</c>
