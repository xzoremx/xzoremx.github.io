to make something and and create
 

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.150 align:start position:0%
to make something and and create
something<00:15:06.000><c> new</c><00:15:06.199><c> and</c><00:15:06.360><c> send</c><00:15:06.560><c> it</c><00:15:06.680><c> out</c><00:15:06.880><c> to</c><00:15:07.040><c> the</c>

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
something new and send it out to the
 

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.269 align:start position:0%
something new and send it out to the
internet<00:15:07.519><c> and</c><00:15:07.680><c> have</c><00:15:07.880><c> anybody</c><00:15:08.320><c> care</c><00:15:08.560><c> about</c><00:15:08.759><c> it</c>

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
internet and have anybody care about it
 

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:12.350 align:start position:0%
internet and have anybody care about it
so<00:15:09.519><c> the</c><00:15:09.680><c> fact</c><00:15:09.880><c> that</c><00:15:10.040><c> we</c><00:15:10.240><c> get</c><00:15:10.360><c> to</c><00:15:10.560><c> do</c><00:15:10.800><c> that</c>

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we get to do that
 

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we get to do that
here<00:15:13.360><c> is</c><00:15:14.079><c> a</c><00:15:14.440><c> privilege</c><00:15:15.440><c> and</c><00:15:15.880><c> uh</c><00:15:16.240><c> I</c><00:15:16.320><c> don't</c><00:15:16.440><c> want</c>

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
here is a privilege and uh I don't want
 

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.749 align:start position:0%
here is a privilege and uh I don't want
to<00:15:16.720><c> forget</c><00:15:17.079><c> that</c><00:15:17.320><c> and</c><00:15:17.440><c> I</c><00:15:17.560><c> also</c><00:15:17.839><c> think</c><00:15:18.519><c> it's</c>

00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
to forget that and I also think it's
 

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:21.829 align:start position:0%
to forget that and I also think it's
sort<00:15:18.920><c> of</c><00:15:19.839><c> clarified</c><00:15:20.680><c> it's</c><00:15:21.000><c> it's</c><00:15:21.240><c> made</c><00:15:21.560><c> a</c><00:15:21.639><c> lot</c>

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
sort of clarified it's it's made a lot
 

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.110 align:start position:0%
sort of clarified it's it's made a lot
