00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
how we see it um there's
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
how we see it um there's
obviously<00:01:27.240><c> uh</c><00:01:27.600><c> it's</c><00:01:27.759><c> not</c><00:01:28.000><c> without</c><00:01:28.360><c> downside</c>

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
obviously uh it's not without downside
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.670 align:start position:0%
obviously uh it's not without downside
and<00:01:29.400><c> so</c><00:01:29.600><c> we</c><00:01:29.720><c> have</c><00:01:29.920><c> approach</c><00:01:30.200><c> it</c><00:01:30.400><c> very</c>

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
