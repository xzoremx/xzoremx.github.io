00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's hopefully going to prevent that
 

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.230 align:start position:0%
it's hopefully going to prevent that
sort<00:13:03.839><c> of</c><00:13:03.959><c> drop</c><00:13:04.279><c> stuff</c><00:13:04.560><c> but</c><00:13:04.680><c> in</c><00:13:04.800><c> the</c><00:13:04.920><c> case</c><00:13:05.079><c> you</c>
