The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href='https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Accuracy of the Data<\/a>).  The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<\/div><\/div><div><br /><\/div><div><b>Data Processing Notes:<\/b><\/div><div><ul><li>This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.
